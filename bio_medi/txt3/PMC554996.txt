After the publication of this work [1] it was brought to our attention that the concentrations of the reagents listed for the cell lysis buffer are those of the original stock solutions and not the required final concentrations. The correct final concentrations for this buffer are as follows:

HEPES 50 mM

NaCl 100 mM

NaF 10 mM

EDTA 5 mM

Na3VO4 0.5 mM

NEM 2 mM

Triton 0.1%

Complete protease inhibitors (Roche).

We regret any inconvenience that this inaccuracy may have caused, and thank Dr. Bräuer for bringing it to our attention.
