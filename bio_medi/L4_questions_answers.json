            "Many researchers have analyzed the complex flow patterns in the distal sapheno-coronary anastomotic region, using various simulated model in an attempt to explain the site of preferential intimal hyperplasia based on the flow disturbances and differential wall stress distribution. In this paper, the geometrical bypass models (aorto-left coronary bypass graft model and aorto-right coronary bypass graft model) are based on real-life situations. In our models, the dimensions of the aorta, saphenous vein and the coronary artery simulate the actual dimensions at surgery. Both the proximal and distal anastomoses are considered at the same time, and we also take into the consideration the cross-sectional shape change of the venous conduit from circular to elliptical. Contrary to previous works, we have carried out computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study in the entire aorta-graft-perfused artery domain. The results reported here focus on (i) the complex flow patterns both at the proximal and distal anastomotic sites, and (ii) the wall shear stress distribution, which is an important factor that contributes to graft patency.",

            "The pace of urbanization in developing countries is more pronounced than in developed countries. Therefore, developing countries are ideal settings for studying the urban-rural difference in BMD. The aim of this study was to examine the difference in BMD between an urban population and a rural population in Thailand.",
            "Figure 5 Cardiac function curves for the Frank-Starling-Baroreceptor model. A summary of the behaviour of the Frank-Starling-Baroreceptor model. The relationship between cardiac function (contractility) and the arterial and venous pressures matches well that reported in many textbooks. However, the vascular volumes show the majority of the blood in the arterial compartment, which is at odds with the fact that the majority of the blood under baseline conditions is in the venous vessels. Furthermore, no constraints have been placed on the model so that unrealistic values (e.g. large negative pressures) can be achieved in some circumstances.",
            "Methods\nGeometrical Model\nThe bypass models simulating the flow field of the anastomosis in the right and left aorto-saphenous bypass grafts are illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b respectively. The ascending aorta is modeled to be of length 80 mm with diameter 25 mm. The normal coronary artery is modeled to be of circular cross-section. The 100% occluded coronary artery is modeled as a straight tube, with dimensions of length 45 mm and diameter 2 mm."
