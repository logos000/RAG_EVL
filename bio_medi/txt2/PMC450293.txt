1. The abbreviation FLJ was expanded incorrectly (as full-length long Japan) in the abbreviations list and in the first paragraph of the Results/Discussion section. FLJ stands for full-length cDNA Japan.

2. In Table 1, the number of cDNAs and the number of library origins for two of the cDNA sources were incorrect. The correct numbers are as follows:
