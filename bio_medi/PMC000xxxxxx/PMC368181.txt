Table 1: In the legend, the words fluxes and flux appeared without the fl.

Table 3: In the legend, the word coefficients appeared without the fi. In the table, some numbers in the section “Binding, dissociation” were marked with a ± sign that should have been a ∓.

Table 4: In the legend, the word coefficients appeared without the fi.

Please see the corrected legends and table below.


Table 1. Numeric Values of Input Quantities of the Model for the Reference State

The data are grouped into concentrations of pathway components, dissociation constants of protein complexes, concentration ratios, fluxes and flux ratios, and characteristic times of selected processes. Experimental evidence for these data is discussed in the text. From these data, the following rates and rate constants are calculated: v
12 = 0.42 nM · min−1 (rate of β-catenin synthesis), v
14 = 8.2 · 10−5 · nM · min−1 (rate of axin synthesis), k
4 = 0.27 min−1, k
5 = 0.13 min−1, k
6 = 9.1 · 10−2 nM−1 · min−1, k
−6 = 0.91 · nM−1 · min−1, k
9 = 210 min−1, k
10 = 210 min−1, k
11 · 0.42 min−1, k
13 = 2.6 · 10−4 min−1, k
15 = 0.17 · min−1. See Table S2, found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000010.t002, for more precise numbers used in the calculations.

Table 3 Control Coefficients for the Total Concentrations of β-Catenin and Axin and Parameters Quantifying the Sensitivity and the Robustness of the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway

Table 4. Concentration Control Coefficients for the Total Concentrations of β-Catenin and Axin Relative to Changes in the Concentrations of Pathway Components

The control coefficients were obtained by numerical determination of the response to a change of total concentrations by 1%. Coefficients are given for the reference state and for the standard stimulated state.
