The following information was missing from the legend for Figure 1: closed squares, NVP; open squares, EFV; error bars denote standard errors. Oliver Flint at Bristol-Myers Squibb alerted PLoS Medicine to this omission.

Figure 1 Change in Plasma Concentrations of Lipids and Lipoproteins
Adjusted for sex, region, pVL decrease, and CD4+-cell increase. Closed squares, NVP; open squares, EFV; error bars denote standard errors.

There was also a line with open circles in Figure 1F that should not have been included.
