        "answer": "experimental setups that physically separate microbial cells from plants",
        "source": "Volatile compounds (VCs) have been shown or suggested to play varied and crucial roles in mediating organismal interactions within and across kingdoms. Plants rely on VCs to attract pollinators, seed dispersers, and parasitoids (Baldwin, 2010; Herrmann, 2010). Animals have evolved sophisticated olfactory systems to detect and respond to foods, threats, and mates through volatile cues (Buck, 2004). Similarly, microbial VCs seem to perform diverse functions such as suppressing competitors, regulating their population density, and controlling morphological transitions (Bailly and Weisskopf, 2012; Bennett \net al.\n, 2012; Bitas \net al.\n, 2013). Roles of microbial VCs in plant growth, development, and stress response have been investigated using several experimental setups that physically separate microbial cells from plants so that only VC-mediated interaction can occur (Ryu \net al.\n, 2003; Kai and Piechulla, 2009; Xie \net al.\n, 2009; Hung \net al.\n, 2013; Vaishnav \net al.",

Over the years, MSCs have been implicated to play a role in a wide range of biological processes such as hematopoiesis (Friedenstein \net al.\n, 1974a), immune-modulation (Klyushnenkova \net al.\n, 2005; Crop \net al.\n, 2010), tissue repair, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis (Yagi and Kitagawa, 2013) and chemoresistance (Kumar \net al.\n, 2017). MSCs possess a vast secretome and have been heralded as factories of extracellular vesicles and âinjury drug storeâ (Caplan and Correa, 2011) for their ability to produce a myriad number of growth factors and cytokines.

During this early phase of replication, HIV-1 converts its single-stranded RNA genome into linear double-stranded DNA in cytoplasm by an intricate reverse transcription process (Hu and Hughes, 2012). After nuclear import, some of these linear viral genomes are integrated into the host chromatin. These are termed proviruses. The remaining cDNA that fails to integrate is circularized into either 1-LTR circle DNA or 2-LTR circle DNAs (Sloan and Wainberg, 2011).

Molecular assays used to detect and analyze changes in HIV-1 early phase replication events are valuable tools in studying HIV pathogenesis and in developing potential antiretroviral drugs. We report here methods to quantitatively analyze several critical events during HIV-1 early phase replication by using Real-time PCR. The early, intermediate and late stages of reverse transcription events are represented by the initiation of HIV-1 minus strand DNA synthesis, the elongation of minus-strand DNA synthesis following transfer of minus strand DNA, and the synthesis of complete double-stranded linear viral DNA after plus-strand DNA transfer respectively. Given that 2-LTR circles are exclusively found in the cell nucleus, they have become a useful marker of viral nuclear import (Sloan and Wainberg, 2011).

Further, various cargos, such as nucleases for gene editing or inhibitors for endosomal receptors, require transport to specific compartments of the cell. Hence, characterization of cellular uptake and endocytic pathways is crucial for the optimization of any nanoparticle-mediated intracellular delivery system. Previous work on endocytic pathways looks at the effect of various pathway inhibitors on the uptake efficiency of nanoparticles carrying fluorescently-labeled cargo. While this helps attribute particle uptake to specific pathways like caveolae-mediated or clathrin-mediated endocytosis, this does not provide a holistic picture of the delivery process. Here, we provide a general protocol that combines systematic studies of inhibitor effects on efficiency with quantification of particle-induced cell membrane permeability. By applying this methodology to a nucleic acid delivery system, for example a helical polypeptide-based nanoparticle for plasmid and guide RNA delivery, we gain understanding of the endocytic mechanisms and cell uptake for intelligent design of intracellular delivery.",

This olfactory-driven behavioral test assesses the USV emitted in presence of unfamiliar odorants such as citral scent or adult male mouse scent. We measure the number of USV emitted as an index of odorant detection during the three periods of the 5-min isolation time of the pup into the sono-olfactometer: first period without any odorant, second period with odorant exposure and last period with exhaust odorant. This protocol can be easily used to reveal olfactory deficits in pups with altered olfactory system due to toxic lesions or infectious diseases.\n\n\nKeywords:",

While a great number of non-operant and operant behavioral tests are available for assessing the sense of smell in adult rodents (Bodyak and Slotnick, 1989; Slotnick and Restrepo, 2005; Kobayakawa \net al.\n, 2007; Yang and Crawley, 2009), there is a serious limitation in exploring olfaction in very young rodents due to their limited behavioral repertoire. Nevertheless, a suitable test to address odor perception in rodent pups has been designed based on the recording of ultrasonic isolation calls (Hofer and Shair, 1991; Hofer \net al.\n, 2002; Lemasson \net al.\n, 2005; Lazarini \net al.\n, 2018).

Infants of most mammals, including humans, also emit repeated vocalizations in the audible range after isolation, as a distress signal aiming at eliciting maternal behavior. USV emission of the isolated rodent pups stops at the contact of the mother, littermates or nest odor (SzentgyÃ¶rgyi \net al.\n, 2008). On the one hand, potentiation of the USV response to isolation can be induced by exposition to the scent of its mother or another lactating female (Shair \net al.\n, 1999). On the other hand, inhibition of the ultrasonic calls could be induced by exposition to the scent of an unfamiliar adult male, one of its common predators in the wild (Shair \net al.\n, 1999). USV inhibition can also be achieved by exposure to a non-social odorant cue, such as citral, that triggers innate aversive response (Lemasson \net al.",

Using this olfactory-induced USV inhibition, we found that congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection alters olfaction as early as Day 6 after birth, long before hearing deterioration in mice (Lazarini \net al.\n, 2018). \nThe current protocol describes a method for assessing odor perception in young mouse pups soon after birth, using a custom-made sono-olfactometer. Because this approach has been developed in the context of congenital viral infection, the sono-olfactometer was designed to prevent any spread of the virus from infected pups to the environment. It can be used therefore in Biosafety level 1 (BSL-1), level 2 (BSL-2) or level 3 (BSL-3) according to the microbial status of the manipulated animals.

With the evolution of next-generation sequencing technologies, establishing quantitative genome-wide DNA methylation profiles is becoming routine in many laboratories.

Here we propose a rapid Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (rRRBS) protocol to minimize PCR amplification bias and reduce total time of multiplexed library construction. In this modified approach, the precise quantification of the final library amplification step is accomplished and monitored by qPCR, instead of using standard PCR and gel electrophoresis, to determine the appropriate number of cycles to perform. The main advantages of this rRRBS method are: i) Reduced amount of amplification enzyme used for library prep, ii) Reduced number of PCR cycles resulting in less PCR amplification bias, and iii) Preparation of quality multiplexed rRRBS libraries in only ~2 days.",

Thus, cost-effective sequencing-based methods for genome-wide methylation analysis, not targeting species-specific genomic sequences, are still highly relevant and valuable especially when profiling large cohorts of samples.

Thus, many molecular genetics techniques have been developed using this organism, including antisense suppression, transient expression, gene disruption, and stable insertion into the genome (Minoda \net al.\n, 2004; Ohnuma \net al.\n, 2008; Imamura \net al.\n, 2009; Imamura \net al.\n, 2010; Zienkiewicz \net al.\n, 2017a; Zienkiewicz \net al.\n, 2017b; Zienkiewicz \net al.\n, 2018).

The direct spread of cells onto an MA2 solid gellan gum plate usually results in the death of the cells (Figure 1A). Hence, the plating method has been modified using the cornstarch embedding method which is commonly used for the cell-wall-less Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain (Shimogawara \net al.\n, 1998). In the cornstarch embedding method, cells are grown on a starch bed prepared by spotting 20% slurry cornstarch on the MA2 solid gellan gum. Cells form colonies on the solid starch bed, but these are often diffused or blurred (Figure 1B). \nTo improve these points, we here devised a novel plating method using melted cornstarch (named in this protocol âtop starch solution methodâ), similar to the top-agar plating method used in bacterial genetics.

IL-9 is produced by various immune cells, such as activated T cells (exemplified by T\nH\n9 cells), mast cells, eosinophils, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2 cells), and induces various functions depending on the target-cell types expressing its receptor (IL-9R) (Gounni \net al.\n, 2000; Stassen \net al.\n, 2000; Noelle and Nowak, 2010; Wilhelm \net al.\n, 2011; Licona-LimoÌn \net al.\n, 2013). Thus, IL-9/IL-9R signaling is mainly involved in immune responses such as allergic inflammations. We successfully generated four rat-mouse hybridomas producing mAbs that react with the native form of mouse IL-9R on cell surfaces. Using these mAbs, we found that IL-9R is selectively expressed on memory B cells among B-lineage cells in the T-cell-dependent immune response.

        "source": "Bulk DNA sequencing, although being widely used nowadays, has been proven to be inadequate in analysis of heterogeneous systems, such as cancer tissues, which contain cancer cells of genetic aberrations at various degrees among normal cells with little or no genetic aberrations. Noncancerous cells can contribute a significant portion of the total DNA extracted from tumors, potentially masking important genetic aberrations (Alioto \net al.\n, 2015). Even when normal cells are removed, bulk sequencing of cancerous cells still averages out both the heterogeneity of cancerous cells in a tumor tissue and genomic instability over time (Yang \net al.\n, 2013; Francis \net al.\n, 2014). Single-cell DNA sequencing is believed to be the only method to reveal unequivocally the dynamics of mutations of tumor cell subpopulations in detail over space and time (Navin, 2015). Copy number variations (CNV) is under-detected in bulk sequencing, while they are found to be early events in tumorigenesis (Navin, 2015).",

        "answer": "TnBC methodology",
        "source": ", 2017). Due to the fact that the minute amount of DNA from a single cell is not sufficient for NGS directly for most purposes, the single-cell genome needs to be amplified. Reflecting this requirement, almost all single-cell library preparation methodologies are named after an amplification method. As amplification is involved, the biases and errors associated with amplification inevitably need to be addressed (Xi, 2018). Biased amplification will require deeper sequencing to gain coverages. In an extreme case, under-amplified regions can be falsely identified as deletions. Amplification errors introduced by polymerases may overwhelm authentic mutations, which adds difficulty in mutation-calls. As TnBC methodology employs unique fragment index (UFI), it can handle amplification biases and polymerase-introduced errors better than other methods do (Xi \net al.\n, 2017; Xi, 2018). \nAn engineered Mu transposase was used in our original paper of TnBC library preparation (Xi \net al.",

Since preparing custom-made transposases is technically demanding and time-consuming, here we report a protocol that utilizes Nextera, a commercially available Tn5 transposase. This protocol is intended to obtain single cell libraries that will be good for CNV detection through shallow sequencing. Due to the proof-reading DNA polymerase that is used in our library amplification, the error rate can be significantly smaller than that from DOP-PCR, MALBAC, or LIANTI. Therefore, the aggregate of sequences from multiple single cells can be used to detect global SNV of the source tissue of the single cells (Knouse \net al.\n, 2016). \n\n\n\n\n## Materials and Reagents\nPipette tips\n96-well plate\nRead1: TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG (suggested source: custom order from IDT)\nRead2: GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAG (suggested source: custom order from IDT)\nTBE buffer: Make 1x from 10x TBE (suggested source: Tris-borate-EDTA Buffer from Fisher Scientific, catalog number: B52)",

Similar approaches have allowed researchers to detect stable granular assemblies of GFP-tagged stress-granule proteins in cell lysates (Jain \net al.\n, 2016; Wheeler \net al.\n, 2017).

Hence, Protocol 3 may not only be useful to study the biochemical nature of viral proteins but also to track any cellular protein that resides in non-membranous organelles such as RNPs and stress granules. For example, integration of the SNAP-tag into the development of cell lines that produce fluorescently tagged stress granules (Kedersha \net al.\n, 2008) could increase experimental flexibility during dynamic and quantitative imaging of these cellular sub-compartments.\nOur three protocols also take advantage of recently developed commercial imaging systems for multi-color fluorescence microscopy.

Besides being an intensively studied topic in academic research, sRNAs also hold a promise as clinical biomarkers. While the need for expressional profiling of sRNAs is growing, preparation of sRNA libraries for high-throughput sequencing (HTS) remains technically challenging, due to their small size. The common PAGE-based protocol is time-consuming and inefficient due to material loss, while gel-free protocols generate libraries of insufficient quality. To overcome these shortcomings, we modified the conditions of size-selection by Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) in a way that allows separation of nucleic acids shorter than 100 nt and differing in length by only 20 nt. Implementing the method for preparation of small RNA libraries for HTS resulted in QsRNA-seq, a gel-free, fast and easy-to-perform protocol, amenable to automation, generating very clean libraries that result in high-depth expression data. The protocol also utilizes Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) for reduction of library preparation biases and to quantify expression levels. QsRNA-seq provides an excellent solution to the growing needs for small RNA expression profiling for research clinical use.",

In this system, up to four different ports can be used to inject compounds to obtain a mitochondrial respiration profile. The procedure described in this protocol includes the preparation of the biopsies, the preparation of the epidermis for insertion into the XF24 Analyzer and the measurement of mitochondrial parameters by the addition of specific mitochondrial inhibitors. This protocol was established for the testing of toxic substances and their influence on the mitochondrial respiration parameters in human epithelial tissue. In addition, age-related effects of various substances can be tested based on the age of the donor.

In the entire complex N-glycosylation process, the transfer of an oligosaccharide chain from a sugar donor to asparagine residues in proteins is the defining event (Figure 1). This reaction is catalyzed by a membrane-bound enzyme, oligosaccharyltransferase (OST or OTase). The acceptor asparagine residues, in principle, reside in the consensus sequence Asn-X-Thr or Asn-X-Ser (or Asn-X-Cys in rare cases), where X can be any amino acid residue except Pro. Eubacterial OST uses an extended version of the 5-residue sequon, Asp-X-Asn-X-Ser/Thr or Glu-X-Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X â  Pro).

Here we introduce a simpler method, which uses a tissue chopper to quickly prepare acute sagittal cerebellar slices from rodents. Cerebellum is dissected from the whole brain and sliced with a tissue chopper into 200-400 Âµm thick slices. Slices are allowed to recover in oxygenated aCSF at 37 Â°C for 1-2 h. Slices can then be used for electrophysiology or other types of experimentation. This method can be used to prepare cerebellar slices from mouse or rat aged from postnatal day 7 to 2 years. The preparation is faster and easier than other methods and provides a more versatile diversity of applications.\n\n\nKeywords:\n Acute cerebellar slice, Cerebellum, Mouse, Rat, Electrophysiology\n\n\nBackground",

In an EB based protocol, iPSCs are dissociated and plated in suspension in a neural induction media to allow them to form EBs, which gradually aggregate over 5-7 days (Pasca \net al.\n, 2011). These EBs are then transferred to a plate that supports cell attachment, enabling the embryoid bodies to attach to the bottom of the plate and spread out into a neural rosette. From this rosette, neural stem cells (NSCs) arise, which can be passaged to form relatively stable neural progenitors cells (NPCs) (Shi \net al.",

Monolayer based protocols chiefly differ in that iPSC colonies are maintained as a monolayer during neural induction, and develop directly into rosettes without aggregation (Chandrasekaran \net al.\n, 2017). Using either approach, generation of NPCs from iPSCs is typically reported to require 21-30 days, with electrically active neurons requiring an additional 30+ days of differentiation from NPCs, for a total time of 50+ days to generate forebrain neurons from iPSCs (Yuan \net al.\n, 2015).",

This approach was first used to determine the Q-modification content in mammalian tissues and bacterial cells during different stages of development and aging (Singhal \net al.\n, 1981). Although useful, this previous method could not measure Q-modification level of individual tRNA. In contrast, our APB-gel based method directly measures the Q-modification levels of individual tRNA species starting with as little as 1-2 Âµg of total RNA.",

Here, we provide detailed protocols for peptide feeding and mechanical wounding for tomato seedlings. To directly introduce peptides into tomato seedlings, peptide solution is fed through the excised stem via the transpiration stream. To mimic the wounding caused by insect feeding, leaflets of tomato seedlings are mechanically damaged with a hemostat; and wounded and systemic unwounded leaves are harvested and analyzed separately.

The application of microfluidics has enabled significant discoveries in platelet biology. For example, by perfusing blood under controlled shear rates over adhesive proteins, it was found that platelets utilize their receptor glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIbÎ±) to adhere to von Willebrand factor (vWF), whereas, they use their receptor integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (Î±\nIIb\nÎ²\n3\n) to adhere to fibrinogen (Ruggeri, 2009; Ju \net al.\n, 2018; Passam \net al.\n, 2018).

During infection, bacteria found in a biofilm community are less sensitive to antibiotics and to the immune response, often allowing them to colonize and persist in the host niche. Not surprisingly, biofilm formation on medical devices, such as urinary catheters, is a major problem in hospital settings. To be able to eliminate such biofilms, it is important to understand the key bacterial factors that contribute to their formation. A common practice in the lab setting is to study biofilms grown in laboratory media. However, these media do not fully reflect the host environment conditions, potentially masking relevant biological determinants.

Since these diseases are mainly biofilm-associated, a better understanding of how \nE. faecalis\n forms biofilms within the host can enable us to develop novel antibacterial therapies (Dunny \net al.\n, 2014).\n \nThe most common method to evaluate bacterial biofilm formation is the microplate biofilm assay, where bacteria are typically grown in microplate wells filled with laboratory media prior to analysis (Azeredo \net al.\n, 2017). However, there is increasing evidence that assays performed in laboratory growth media do not fully recapitulate conditions found within the host, and potentially overlook important bacterial factors required during infection (Nallapareddy and Murray, 2008; Guiton \net al.\n, 2013; Flores-Mireles \net al.\n, 2014; Colomer-Winter \net al.\n, 2017 and 2018; Xu \net al.\n, 2017).

The paradox was resolved by the key finding that Ebp binds to fibrinogen (Nallapareddy \net al.\n, 2011) and that the host releases fibrinogen into the bladder as a result of catheter-associated inflammation (Flores-Mireles \net al.\n, 2014). Indeed, addition of fibrinogen to urine enhanced enterococcal biofilm formation \nex vivo\n and enabled the discovery that \nE. faecalis\n cells attach to urinary catheters primarily via Ebp-fibrinogen interactions (Flores-Mireles \net al.\n, 2014). While this method successfully d the results found \nin vivo\n, it ultimately confirmed the critical role of fibrinogen to enterococcal pathogenesis and led to the development of a vaccine therapy (Flores-Mireles \net al.\n, 2014, 2016a and 2016b).

HBV infection leads to higher risks of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Liang \net al.\n, 2015). At present, chronic HBV infection is not curable as current treatments do not eradicate the replicative reservoir, covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA (Levrero \net al.\n, 2016).

        "source": ", 2017; Schreiner and Nassal, 2017). cccDNA serves as the viral template for pregenomic RNA which becomes encapsidated into nucleocapsids and is reverse transcribed to generate rcDNA and double-stranded linear (dsl)DNA by the viral polymerase (Bartenschlager and Schaller, 1992; Tu \net al.\n, 2017). Of note, albeit the reconstitution of hepatoma cells with the receptor human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), high excess of inoculated virions with high multiple genome equivalents (mges) (mges > 100) is required to achieve moderate infection rates (\ne.g.\n, > 20% in HepG2\nNTCP\n cells) (Qu \net al.\n, 2018). This raises the problem that cccDNA-containing samples taken early after inoculation with HBV contain large amounts of rcDNA from input virions.\nTherefore, adequate methodologies for absolute or relative quantification of cccDNA are required. They are divided into two categories: (I) hybridization after separation by gel electrophoresis (Southern blot) and (II) PCR amplification (Li \net al.",

Southern blot is still a gold standard but not very sensitive, and demands multiple experimental processes and a high-copy load of cccDNA (> 2 x 10\n6\n copies using \n32\nP-radioactive isotope/digoxigenin/biotin probe; > 1 x 10\n4\n copies using branched DNA technique) (Yu \net al.\n, 2015). Therefore, hybridization-based methods are complicated, time-consuming and not practical for a large number of samples (\ne.g.\n, > 20) to be analyzed in parallel. PCR methods include real-time quantitative (q)PCR, nested qPCR (Xu \net al.\n, 2011), digital-droplet PCR (Mu \net al.\n, 2015), and rolling circle amplification (Margeridon \net al.\n, 2008). Real-time qPCR is the fastest and the most robust method for almost all laboratories.

The disease triangle paradigm requires, among all, a favorable environment for disease to develop (Francl, 2001; Scholthof, 2007).

It is, thus, important to quantify the effect of environments on host-pathogen interactions.\n \nCell death by HR during ETI is often quantified using a time-course measurement of ion leakage from infected tissue to the aqueous solution surrounding the tissues (Hatsugai and Katagiri, 2018). However, when interested in assessing the contribution of the environment to the HR development, it is necessary for tissue to remain in the environment being studied until HR has developed.\n \nIn this protocol, we subject infected tissue to 50% RH or 90% RH for 36 h before conductivity is measured.

        "answer": "3-5 nm",

Cellulose microfibrils (CMFs) are the largest wall polymers with a radius of 3-5 nm and many micrometers long (Cosgrove, 2005). The orientation of CMFs determines the direction of growth and cell anisotropy (Baskin, 2005), but the CMFs also interact with other wall components all together modifying the wall properties (reviewed in Majda, 2018; Majda and Robert, 2018). The study of cell wall composition has a long history, going back to when different chemicals were applied to bind to the wall composites; however, many of them had a wide range of targets (Wallace and Anderson, 2012; Voiniciuc \net al.",

In addition, this method also allows researchers to perform the coinjection of fluorescent dextrans with special drugs or proteins that allows the colleagues to assay the effect of those drugs or proteins on the permeability of PD. However, this method requires a rigorous experimental system and a highly experienced operator to perform the experiments. The second method is Drop-ANd-See (DANS) which uses the 5(6)-carboxy ï¬uorescein diacetate (CFDA) for the rapid assessment of PD permeability (Cui \net al.\n, 2015). DANS is a simple and rapid approach, but it is impossible to trace the spread of CFDA at the single cell resolution.

Moreover, WT1 is useful to evaluating podocyte number and density under different circumstances. The advantages to use podocalyxin staining are i) to analyze the glomerular morphology, ii) to quantify flocculus area to perform WT1+ cells / flocculus area ratio; iii) to ensure that WT1+ cells are podocytes and no other cells as parietal epithelial cells which could express WT1 in pathophysiological context. \nOur protocol can be used in crescentic glomerulonephritis (Henique \net al.\n, 2017) but also in studies on different glomerulopathies as hypertensive nephropathy.\n\n\n\n\n## Materials and Reagents\nSlides Menzel-GlÃ¤ser Superfrost\nÂ®",

The TRIS device presented here builds on these developments to provide a robust platform for microscopy-based studies of the interactions between plant roots and associated microorganisms that can be implemented in a typical experimental biology laboratory (Massalha \net al.\n, 2017). The TRIS device enables precise control over environmental parameters within the system while allowing direct observation of dynamic biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here we discuss in details the TRIS assembly and operation. Studying root-microbe interactions in this device allows the use of endless combinations of bacterial strains and plant genotypes that could be examined with multiple fluorescent reporters. Altogether, we hope and anticipate that the TRIS experimental system, and other platforms building upon it, will open the way for extensive high-resolution studies of the dynamic root microenvironment and interactions within it.\n\n\n\n\n## Materials and Reagents",

This memory task has two phases. First, the subject is familiarized to an open arena with two objects and is allowed to explore the objects. Following a delay period, the subject returns to the arena, but one of the previous objects has been moved to a new location. Greater exploration of the displaced object is used as the index of memory for the previous object location. An advantage of the DOR task is that subjects can be tested without explicit training, since this task exploits the natural tendency to be more interested in something novel. The spontaneous aspect of this task allows for the testing of animals as well as human populations that are unable to follow verbal instructions, such as babies. Therefore, this powerful test of recognition memory can be administered similarly for many species, including rats and humans, allowing for better translatability.",

For example, certain populations may have difficulty in navigating, but can still form and retrieve spatial memories. In addition, the performance aspect of navigation, independent of the spatial memory, may require the recruitment of additional brain areas. Therefore, it is important to have tests of spatial memory that are non-navigational. The DOR task provides a means for assessing spatial memory recognition without the animal having to navigate to a learned reference location in order to express the memory. \n\n\n\n\n## Materials and Reagents\nNote: All materials and reagents listed are examples based on what has been used successfully using the protocol provided; however, using different bedding, objects, rat strains/ages could also be successful.\n \nBed-o-cob Â¼ in (Fisher Scientific, Harlan Teklad, catalog number: NC9335529)\nScrews",

        "source": "The development of neural networks involves the growth and navigation of axons toward their target. It has recently been shown that neural network development depends not only on molecular cues acting on the developing axon, but also on extrinsic and intrinsic mechanical forces (Reviewed in Franze \net al.\n, 2013, Franze, 2013, Gangatharan \net al.\n, 2018). In the course of a study analyzing the mechanisms of fasciculation/defasciculation of olfactory sensory axons, we discovered that the mechanical tension of axons plays a critical role in regulating these processes (Å mÃ­t \net al.\n, 2017a). The mechanical tension of PC-12 axons or dorsal root ganglia neurites, as well as motor neuron axons in \nDrosophila\n embryo, had previously been measured using calibrated needles or microelectromechanical systems (Dennerll \net al.\n, 1988 and 1989; Rajagopalan \net al.",

These approaches, however, appeared inappropriate for olfactory axons characterized by a very small diameter (200 nm), mostly because physical contact of the manipulator with the substrate would be inevitable, and would lead to inaccurate force measurements. To assess the mechanical tension of these thin axons, we developed a new protocol using the Biomembrane Force Probe (BFP) technique, in which a red blood cell is used as a force transducer (Evans \net al.\n, 1995; Gourier \net al.\n, 2008), adapted here for the first time to axon manipulations \nex vivo\n. In our protocol, live axons are biotinylated, then streptavidin-coated glass microbeads (3 Î¼m diameter) are attached to the biotinylated axons; these beads are then manipulated with a biotinylated red blood cell held by an aspirating micropipette (Å mÃ­t \net al.\n, 2017a and 2017b). The force with which the bead is manipulated can be calculated by measuring the deformation of the red blood cell, using our recently developed software (Å mÃ­t \net al.\n, 2017b).",

Recent advance in bio-orthogonal chemical reporters such as azides and alkynes allows us to quantitatively monitor and track biomolecules (proteins, lipids or nucleic acids) through click chemistry (Dieterich, 2010). Azidohomoalaine (AHA) (Figure 1) is a methionine analog that contains an azide moiety and is incorporated into newly synthesized proteins.

Moreover, KSHV prevalence and KS incidence appear to be increasing, even in HAART treated HIV patients with controlled viremias (Maurer \net al.\n, 2007; Labo \net al.\n, 2015). Understanding the interplay of viral and host factors in KS oncogenesis is critical for the rational development of new therapies (Dittmer and Krown, 2007; Sullivan \net al.\n, 2009). Many host signaling cascades co-opted by KSHV including PI3K/AKT/mTORC, NFkB and Notch are critical for cell-specific mechanisms of transformation and their identification is paving the way to therapeutic target discovery (Sodhi \net al.\n, 2006; Emuss \net al.\n, 2009; Liu \net al.\n, 2010; Mesri \net al.",

        "question": "What type of dyes does the irNorthern method utilize?",
        "answer": "IR dyes",
        "source": ", 1990). While successful, DIG probes require secondary detection by antibodies, more hands-on time and expensive reagents, deterring its wider adoption. Our recently published method, irNorthern, is straightforward and adaptable. It utilizes IR dyes which reduce auto-fluorescent background (Zarnegar \net al.\n, 2016; Miller \net al.\n, 2018). These IR dyes are conjugated with a dibenzocyclooctyne group (DBCO), which forms a covalent bond with the azide on the probes through copper-free click chemistry. To demonstrate its applications, we performed irNorthern to detect microRNA let-7a and small nuclear RNA U6 in total RNAs extracted from HCT116 wild-type and Drosha knockout cells (Kim \net al.",
