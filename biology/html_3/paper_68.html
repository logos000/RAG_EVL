<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol provides the steps required for the establishment of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) and their utility in examining drug responses. PDXs recapitulate the heterogeneity observed in the corresponding human tumors, which makes them an ideal pre-clinical model system. This protocol outlines the detailed steps required for (1) the generation of HNSCC-PDXs, (2) the processing of tumor tissues, and (3) the expansion of PDX models into cohorts for (4) drug testing.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol please refer to <a href="#bib3">Karamboulas et al. (2018)</a>.</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Protocol Overview</div>
<p>Steps required for establishing Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and for preparing the subsequent cohorts for drug testing. (1) The surgically resected patient tumor is cut into 5-10 pieces (2 mm x 2 mm) (number of pieces implanted depends on size of the patient tumor). One tumor piece is implanted per mouse subcutaneously into the left flank of NSG mice. (2) Passage 1 (P1) PDX tumors are extracted, minced and enzymatically dissociated into a single cell suspension that is subcutaneously (3) injected (100,000 to 250,000 cells per mouse) into the left flanks of a cohort of at least 10 mice. (4) The drug is administered daily when PDX tumors are approximately 80 to 120mm<sup>3</sup>. Tumor volumes are measured every 4 days.</p>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> All steps are to be done in a laminar hood and under sterile conditions.</div>
<h3>Implantation of Tumor Pieces</h3>
<ol>
<li>Primary tumor samples are obtained from patients undergoing surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Samples are collected with informed consent and must be performed with the approval of the Research Ethics Board (REB) or Institutional Review Board (IRB).</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Be aware of the potential presence of human pathogens. Be sure to adhere to appropriate biosafety protocols when handling human tissues. Also, antibiotics should be added to the media to prevent bacterial contamination during tissue processing.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> To preserve tissue viability, it is important to obtain and to process the patient sample as soon as possible, within 1 to 4 hours of surgical resection.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>All mouse experiments must be performed with the approval of an Animal Care Committee that is relevant to your research institution.</li>
<li>Immunocompromised mice are used for implantation of patient tumors, with a preference for NOD-SCID-IL2Rγ<sup>null</sup> (NSG) mice (6 to 8 weeks old) since they have a more severely impaired immune system. Supplier of NSG mice is the Jackson Laboratory (<a href="https://www.jax.org">https://www.jax.org</a>). Alternatively, NOD-SCID or NOD-Rag1<sup>null</sup>-IL2rγ<sup>null</sup> can be used.</li>
<li>A strict barrier environment is required to house and maintain immune-compromised mice. All food, water, bedding and cages entering the room should be autoclaved or sterilized. Personal protective equipment (sterile gown, mask, hair net, double gloves) is essential to minimize the spread of bacteria to mice. Mouse cages must be opened in a Type II Biological Safety Cabinet. Sterile surgical instruments and frequent disinfection of gloves and equipment with Clidox (1:5:1) and 70% ethanol must be performed when handling mice. It is good practice to place mice into fresh cages weekly to maintain their health.</li>
<li>All the surgical instruments must be autoclaved and opened in the laminar flow hood.</li>
<li>An isoflurane chamber with nose cone attachment is required to anesthetize the mice.</li>
<li>Prepare a pack of the following surgical instruments and autoclave: Sharp/blunt scissors; 1 curved forceps; 1 Straight forceps</li>
</ol>
<h3>Dissociation into a Single-Cell Suspension</h3>
<ol start="8">
<li>Bulk tumor PDX cell suspensions are used to establish cohorts in Step 3. Injecting a bulk cell suspension (rather than implanting pieces) allows for a more even distribution of tumor cells into each mouse and thus a similar growth rate of tumors across all the mice.</li>
<li>s in step 1, the tumor is processed under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood and all materials must be sterile.</li>
<li>A 37<sup>o</sup>C incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) is required for incubation during dissociation.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Drug Treatment</h3>
<ol start="11">
<li>Prepare drug stocks (e.g. abemaciclib) and store aliquots in freezer.</li>
<li>Begin treatments when tumors reach between 80 to 120 mm<sup>3</sup>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Implantation of Tumor Pieces</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼2 h</div>
<p>This step describes what is required to implant the primary patient samples into NSG mice to establish the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, Step 1). Five to ten pieces of the patient tumor are implanted subcutaneously into 5 to 10 mice (1 piece per mouse). Aim for 10 pieces, however, due to small patient samples a smaller number of tumor fragments may have to be implanted.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This first generation of PDXs (or passage 1, P1) is established to <u>expand</u> the initial tissue so that enough cells can be obtained for further experiments (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, Step 2-4). The growth of even 1 of 10 tumors implanted allows for further experiments to be performed. Of course, non-engrafting tumors cannot be tested further.</div>
<ol>
<li>Collect the patient tumor tissue from surgical pathology. Place the specimen in a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube containing 20 ml sterile PBS and store on ice until ready to process.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The sample should be processed as soon as possible (i.e. within 1–4 h) to preserve cell viability.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>In a laminar flow hood, place the patient tumor in a small petri dish and under sterile conditions cut into 2 x 2 mm pieces (5 to 10). One piece will be implanted per mouse. Add sterile PBS to the dish to prevent the tissues from drying out, seal the dish with paraffin film and place on ice.</li>
</ol>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Extra tumor pieces can be cryopreserved. Place 5 pieces of tumor per cryovial and add 900 μl FBS + 100 μl DMSO to freeze down. Place the vials into a Mr. Frosty and then store the Mr. Frosty in a - 80 °C freezer for a minimum of 4 h. For long term storage transfer the vials into a liquid nitrogen freezer.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Before entering the mouse facility, put on personal protective equipment (sterile gown, mask, hair net, and double gloves).</li>
<li>Spray and wipe down the inside of the biological safety cabinet first with Clidox (1:5:1) followed by 70% Ethanol.</li>
<li>Place the dish with the tissue pieces and the required materials in the biological safety cabinet to prepare for surgical implantation (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</li>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 2. Preparation for Surgical Implantation</div>
<p>After disinfecting the biological safety cabinet prepare the following: (a) Isoflurane chamber, (b) electric clippers, (c) sterile gauze sponges, (d) isoflurane tube with nose cone, (e) sterilized surgical instrument pack, (f) sterile ear notcher, (g) autoclip applicator, (h) meloxicam, (i) human patient tumor pieces, (j) ethanol (70%), (k) clidox (1:5:1). Missing in picture but required: surgical scrub betadine, betadine solution, tear gel.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="6">
<li>Place a warm heating pad under a new clean cage with sterile paper towel on top of the bedding to serve as the recovery cage.</li>
<li>Anesthetize the mice in an isoflurane chamber using Isoflurane at 5% and an oxygen flow of 1.5 L/minute until breathing reaches thoraco-abdominal region. Reduce anesthetic to 2.5% for the remaining surgical procedure.</li>
<li>Once anesthetized, position the mouse in the nose cone in ventral recumbence.</li>
<li>Place tear gel in eyes, ear punch mice for identification and use electric clippers to shave the left (or right) flank for implant.</li>
<li>Inject mouse with meloxicam 5 mg/kg subcutaneously for pain management.</li>
<li>Place the mouse back into the induction chamber to clean up shaved hair and area before surgical procedure.</li>
<li>Replace sterile paper towels under nose cone and lay out sterile paper towels for surgical instruments. Open the sterile <u>pack of instruments</u> described in the “Before you begin” section.</li>
<li>Position mouse in the nose cone in ventral recumbence.</li>
<li>Scrub the surgical site with Scrub Surgical Betadine then wipe away surgical scrub with 70% Ethanol.</li>
<li>Swab surgical site with Betadine Solution and allow it to dry.</li>
<li>Test that the mouse is in surgical plane by performing a toe pinch. This is done by taking the toes of the back foot of the mouse and pinching between your thumb and index finger. The mouse should not retract its leg once it has reached surgical plane.</li>

<p>This section describes the steps for preparation and injection of bulk tumor cells into a large cohort of mice (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Injecting a bulk cell suspension (rather than implanting pieces) allows for a more even distribution of tumor cells into each mouse and thus allows for a similar growth rate of tumors across all the mice. The following steps were used to establish the cohorts of mice from our recent publication that were treated with abemaciclib (<a href="#bib3">Karamboulas et al, 2018</a>).</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Prepare a bulk suspension of fresh tumor cells or thaw a vial of previously cryopreserved cells.</li>
<li>Count the total number of cells suspended in PBS and determine the number of cells to inject per mouse for a group of <i>at least</i> 10 mice. Typically, between 100, 000 to 250, 000 cells are enough to ensure engraftment across all mice and to produce an even growth rate. (However, some tumors may require higher cell numbers (<i>i.e.</i> 400, 000 to 500, 000).</li>
</ol>

<li>Cold Matrigel matrix will be mixed at a 1:1 ratio with cell suspension in cold PBS.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Matrigel matrix contains extracellular matrix components that allow for the cells to remain localized at the injection site.</div>

<li>volume of 100 μl total (50 μl Matrigel + 50 μl cell suspension) is injected per mouse.</li>
<li>Prepare the cells plus Matrigel for all 10 injections in one tube in order to reduce variation from mouse to mouse. Be sure to prepare a few extra doses due to loss of sample in the needle hub.</li>
<li>Before filling the 1 ml (26-gauge needle) syringe, ensure Matrigel plus cells are <u>mixed well</u> by tapping the tube and/or inverting it a few times. Keep on ice.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> It is essential to thoroughly mix the cold cell/Matrigel mixture immediately before injections to ensure even distribution of cells as they will settle to bottom of tube.</div>
<ol start="45">
<li>Fill the syringe with cell/Matrigel mixture at the time the mice are ready to be injected. If the syringe is prepared with the cell/Matrigel mixture too far in advance, the cells will start to settle in the syringe and can get trapped inside the hub. It is critical to add the cell/Matrigel mixture right before you are ready to inject to ensure that the cells are evenly distributed in the syringe and that each mouse is injected with an equal number of cells.</li>
<li>Wet a sterile gauze sponge with 70 % ethanol. Place the sponge on the floor of the laminar hood and gently drag the needle across the sponge to wipe off excess cells on the outside before proceeding with injection.</li>
<li>Hold the mouse in an Intraperitoneal (IP) hold and subcutaneously inject 100 μl into the left flank of each mouse.</li>
<li>Ear notch each mouse to identify.</li>

<h3>Drug Treatment of PDX Cohorts</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼2 h</div>
<p>This section describes the steps that were used to treat HNSCC-PDX mice with abemaciclib (LY2835219) in our recent paper (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). This protocol can be used for treating with other drugs of interest, using the appropriate vehicle, dose and delivery route that is appropriate.</p>
<ol start="49">
<li>Monitor the tumor growth of each mouse.</li>
<li>Using calipers measure and record the measurements for each tumor (length and width, mm).</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>Volume = (L x W<sup>2</sup>) ∗ 0.52</li>
</ol>
<ol start="51">
<li>Treatment will begin when the volumes of the tumors reach approximately 80 to 120mm<sup>3</sup>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> It is important that all tumors are approximately of similar volume.</div>
<ol start="52">
<li>Randomize the ten mice into two groups of 5 (Drug (abemaciclib) (5) vs Vehicle Control (sterile milli-q water) (5)).</li>
<li>Weigh each mouse before treatment starts to determine the volume of abemaciclib to administer so that each mouse is receiving 100 mg/kg. Use this volume until the end of treatment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Working concentrations should be determined such that you are administering an appropriate volume based on the method of delivery. Oral gavage is limited to 1% volume of total body weight, e.g., a 20 g mouse is given a maximum of 0.2 ml.</div>
<p>The working concentration of drug must take into account the volume of drug that can be delivered safely. In our case, we used a working stock concentration of 25 mg/ml which gave a range of 70 - 130 μl depending on the body weight of the animal.</p>
<p>Example calculation:</p>
<p>0.025 kg (body weight of mouse) x 100 mg/kg (dose) x 1 ml/25 mg = 0.1 ml volume of drug</p>
<ol start="54">
<li>Mice are treated daily with abemaciclib or sterile water by oral gavage/feeding tubes and measurements are recorded twice a week (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A).</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected Outcomes</h2>
<p>The tumors take 1 to 4 months to engraft where some PDX tumors are palpable by 2 weeks and others after several weeks. By 6 months, if no tumor has formed, it is unlikely that a tumor will form and therefore 6 months is used as an endpoint for tumor growth after implantation and mice are sacrificed.</p>
<p>The implanted samples that show no growth in mice are termed non-engrafters. Engraftment efficiency will vary between patient samples. For example, more aggressive patient tumors will engraft at 90 to 100% efficiency (9 to 10 of the pieces implanted grow out tumors) and less aggressive tumors will engraft at 10 to 20% efficiency (<i>i.e.</i> 1 to 2 of the 10 pieces).</p>
<p>10 mice were set up for each patient model where 5 mice were treated with abemaciclib and 5 mice were treated with vehicle control. A power calculation indicated that, based on typical tumor volumes and standard deviations, a sample size of 5 mice per group provided 85% power to detect a decrease in tumor volume of at least 50% in the treated group relative to the control group at the end point of the experiment. Note that larger cohorts of mice would be required to detect smaller differences in mean tumor volume between treatment and control groups. Ideally, a power calculation should be performed to determine the appropriate sample size to detect the desired effect size.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and Statistical Analysis</h2>
<ol>
<li>It is helpful to create a file that can be used to record information and results during the treatment (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A).</li>
<li>The average tumor volume for each time point is calculated and graphs to depict tumor growth are generated (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B, e.g. we used GraphPad Prism6.)</li>
<li>At the endpoint, the weight for each tumor is recorded and the average tumor weight is calculated for each treatment group (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C).</li>
<li>A Student’s t-test can be used for statistical analysis between the two groups at individual time points or at end point. For growth curve analysis, which involves longitudinal samples with repeated-measures, a type II ANOVA or (preferably) a mixed model regression analysis should be used.</li>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>One limitation of the PDX model system includes the failure for a patient tumor to successfully engraft. This is a common feature across other cancer types as well. Indeed, individual patient samples will vary in their rates of tumor formation (for example, some patient samples engraft at high rates (90 to 100%), some low (10 to 20%), and some in between), however, some will NOT form tumors and cannot be studied further. In addition, due to the nature of NSG mice, some population types in a PDX tumor cannot be examined. For example, <i>human</i> tumor stroma cells (ie. immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts) do not survive during xenograft formation. While mouse fibroblasts replace the lost human fibroblasts, NSG mice lack an intact immune system and therefore contribution of immune cells cannot be studied. Morever, although mouse fibroblasts replace the human fibroblasts in the PDX tumor, cell signaling and protein-protein interactions may be altered due to mouse-human compatibility issues. Lastly, few patient samples produce ulcers and cystic tumors when implanted into mice which affect the viability of tumor cells recovered. These tumors may not be suitable for further studies.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>No tumors formed.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Ensure that the tumor tissue is fresh and that pieces are cut at 2 x 2 mm. Be sure to cut from the fleshy portion of the tumor. Recognize necrotic areas of the tumor and scrape those areas out.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Some patient samples will NOT form PDX tumors,</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>This is likely due to <u>unknown</u> features of the patient tumor and mouse model system. This is common in other cancer types as well.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Difficulty dissociating samples.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Highly keratinized HNSCC samples are more difficult to dissociate and often present with reduced recovery of cell number and quality due to the increased level of debris.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Low viable tumor cell count after dissociation.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Be sure to mix the minced tumor and dissociation solution thoroughly and often during the 2 to 3 hours of incubation. This trituration is essential for effective dissociation of the tumor tissue. Also, some tumors will be thoroughly dissociated in 1.5 to 2 hours. Look at the cells under the light microscope to look for single cells. Dissociating tissues too long can decrease overall cell viability.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Not all mice are engrafting for mouse cohort establishment using injection of bulk cells suspensions.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>For injections of tumor cell suspensions, cell numbers that are below the threshold to initiate a tumor should be taken into account when considering how many mice to inject. Most tumor suspensions will initiate tumors efficiently at cell numbers of 100,000. If not all mice are engrafting in your cohort than try injecting at a higher cell number.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>During injections of tumor cell suspensions, cells can leak out.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>This can happen for a variety of reasons but generally relates to the speed and/or force of injection. If the injection is done too quickly, the Matrigel, which adds structure and keeps cells in close contact, will not have enough time to warm and solidify in the injection site. To avoid this, place needle under the skin, inject the cells and hold for a count of 3 seconds. Turn the needle a quarter of a turn and gently pull the needle out. This should leave a formed bubble under the skin and minimize cells from following the needle out of the injection site. Another precaution to avoid cell leakage is to ensure that the restraint of the mouse during injection is not too tight. Be sure to have enough loose skin on the flank to be able to create a pocket for the cells. When the skin is pulled too tight during injection this will prevent the ability of the cells to form a pocket and the added pressure will cause the cells to leak out around the needle during injection.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Lymphomas can develop at the engraftment site.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Characterize the histology of engrafted tumors to rule this out. These are derived from EBV-infected lymphocytes present in the engrafted specimens (<a href="#bib1">Bondarenko et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2012</a>). Lymphomas have a distinct histology, with a small round blue cell appearance. Suspected lymphomas can be confirmed if necessary by pan-cytokeratin (anti-pan Cytokeratin antibody [C11], ab7753, abcam) staining, as these will be cytokeratin-negative, whereas HNSCC tumors will be positive. If necessary, consult a pathologist to confirm engrafted tumors are HNSCC.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Ulcerations near engraftment site.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Work with your Animal Care Committee to provide appropriate treatment.</p>

<h2 id="q-and-a">Q&amp;A</h2>
<p class="question"><b>Q:</b> At step 31, can you use a vortex at low speed instead of gentle pipetting?</p>
<p class="answer"><b>A:</b> ​Gentle pipetting is highly recommended as some cell types within the tumor are sensitive to the use of a vortex. One could test using a vortex versus pipetting by looking at a small volume of the cell suspension at the end of dissociation mixed with trypan blue to compare the two methods. When the cell/trypan mixture is looked at under a light microscope, more blue stained cells (dead cells) would mean more damage to the cells.</p>
<p class="question"><b>Q:</b> Have you used this approach for any other types of tumor samples?</p>
<p class="answer"><b>A:</b>​ Yes, we have successfully used this approach for breast cancer, ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma.</p>
