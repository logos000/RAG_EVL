<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Modeling traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been a challenge. Rodent and cellular models have provided relevant contributions despite their limitations. Here, we present a protocol for a TBI model based on the controlled cortical impact (CCI) performed on human cerebral organoids (COs), self-assembled 3D cultures that recapitulate features of the human brain. Here, we generate COs from iPSCs obtained from reprogrammed fibroblasts.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00693-6/sref13">Ramirez et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol describes a procedure to generate iPSC from fibroblast to further develop COs and perform TBI using the controlled cortical impact procedure. The execution of this protocol requires experience in advanced cell culture techniques, a sterile workspace, and specialized equipment. Further, it requires knowledge of mouse skull anatomy, experience on stereotaxic frames and the vernier scale, experience with controlled cortical impact procedures, and histology.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Choosing starting points</h3>
<p>Cerebral organoids can be grown from iPSCs (<a href="#bib16">Velasco et al., 2019</a>). iPSCs can be derived from fibroblast (<a href="#bib10">Malik and Rao, 2013</a>). Fibroblast and human iPSC are commercially available. This protocol allows you to start from fibroblast or readily derived iPSCs.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Choosing the cerebral organoid culture strategy</h3>
<p>TBI pathology is complex and involves multiple cell types present in the brain. Several in vitro models of TBI have recently been developed based on human iPSC-derived 2D cell culture models. However, using these models, it is difficult to comprehensively elucidate the changes at the level of network connections and the interactions of diverse nerve cell types, which is a key aspect of TBI pathology.</p>
<p>Cerebral organoids, derived from human iPSC, generate diverse cell types present in the human brain. Furthermore, COs can develop different brain-like regions, where diverse cell types maintain their brain-like positional organization and interactions to some extent. To generate COs, we followed an optimized method developed by StemCell Technologies. The reagents necessary to generate COs using this method are available to the scientific community in a kit format. Several groups, including the Lancaster group (<a href="#bib12">Pellegrini et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib7">Giandomenico et al., 2019</a>) and others (such as <a href="#bib17">Zhao et al., 2020</a>) have recently used this protocol to reliably generate COs.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Working with a high risk of culture contamination</h3>
<p>Cerebral organoid cultures are maintained throughout all the processes in absence of antimicrobial reagents. Sterile conditions in your workspace are thus essential. To accomplish this protocol, you will require an autoclave, a hydrogen peroxide steamer for gas sterilization, and a biosafety cabinet.</p>

<p>CCI Protocol: The Leica impactor one CCI device allows to calibrate 3 relevant parameters: speed, dwell time, and depth. Variations on these protocols may be necessary to adapt your model. (<a href="#bib11">Osier and Dixon, 2017</a>). We suggest a speed of 4 m/s, dwell time of 200 ms, and 1 mm depth as previously performed by our group (<a href="#bib6">Edwards et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Microscope set up: the fluorophores used in this study are suitable for several fluorescence microscopes loaded with laser options at 405 nm, 458 nm, 488 nm, or 594 nm wavelengths. Scanning capabilities and confocal microscopy are highly recommended.</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Cerebral organoids are cultured in absence of any antimicrobial compound. Thus, sterility is key to the successful growth of organoids, and to perform the CCI procedure. Cleared bones with the previously explained method will help to provide a sample free of bacteria, although it is highly recommended to perform a sterilization method to secure the sterility of our sample. High-temperature strategies are not recommended to sterilize bones, thus gas-based methods are suitable for this purpose.

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Calibrate the impact depth using the vernier scale on the stereotactic frame in the Z-axis. Perform this depth adjustment after setting the zero with the contact sensor in the CCI equipment (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D).</div>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The extent of recovery time before analysis depends on the experimental design. However, 7 days were sufficient to evaluate the events associated with cellular response to primary injury after CCI. Long-term recovery times (100–180 days post-impact) can be also performed.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>In our experience, up to 80%–85% of the COs generated in this protocol can contain over 70% neuroepithelial tissue (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>E). The efficiency can be further increased by prescreening organoids containing more than 70% or higher content of neuroepithelial structure at day 13 (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>E). The investigator can decide the time to apply the CCI procedure based on the hypothesis tested. For example, we recommend performing the CCI in COs not earlier than 150 days in vitro (DIV) if the investigator wants to study the consequences of CCI in mature postmitotic neurons and astrocytes. At this stage, cerebral organoids should have developed postmitotic neurons and begun generating astrocytes. This will allow the study of changes on GFAP expression, all along with cellular morphology to address astrogliosis; reduction in MAP2 as an indicator of neuronal loss; upregulation of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) as makers of metabolic changes related to neuronal damage; cleaved caspase 3 to evaluate cellular death.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The protocol uses an agarose-based polymer to reproduce the stiffness and density of the brain. Although our approach requires an open skull, further development to apply the impact as a closed skull injury is desirable. However, for agarose-gelatin-based models, it is technically difficult since the liquid phase at high temperature could affect COs biology.</p>
<p>COs can produce a rich diversity of cells and brain-like structures. However, this model, as it is, currently lacks cell types and structural components necessary to model the complete spectrum of TBI pathology. In addition, lack of nutrient delivery tends to produce a necrotic core in the COs. Nevertheless, this is a rapidly developing area. Brain organoids can be enriched with microglia (<a href="#bib1">Abud et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib3">Brownjohn et al., 2018</a>) which is crucial for TBI pathology. Functional vasculature can be developed in brain organoids (<a href="#bib4">Cakir et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib15">Shi et al., 2020</a>), which can eventually help us model the cerebrovascular pathology associated with TBI.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Inappropriate coating due to premature polymerization of Matrigel®</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Before starting a passage, check the Matrigel-coated plate under a microscope. Matrigel should look like small punctuated polymers homogeneously distributed in the plate. If they do not look homogeneously distributed, or bigger and darker particles are present, this could impair the iPSC culture. To avoid this problem, keep Matrigel always in ice and take it out of ice only to be added to the medium to prepare the plates. Use pre-cooled 200 μL tips to pipette Matrigel® and be aware to have DMEM/F-12 medium at 4°C to dilute it. Serological pipettes that will be used to pipette the diluted Matrigel also can be pre-cooled at 4°C for 15 min before being used. Prepared plates should be kept immediately at 4°C to be stored for up to 2 weeks or incubated at 37°C to be used.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Many dead cells around the EBs.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is normal to find some dead cells around the EBs. However, too many dead cells can be a problem. This may happen due to (1) inadequate ROCK inhibition; (2) harsh handling of the cells while generating the single-cell suspension. iPSCs tend to become apoptotic while cultured as single cells. It is important to have the apoptosis inhibitor ROCK in the media as early as the single-cell suspension is generated. Please make sure that the ROCK inhibitor stock is not freeze-thawed multiple times. We recommend the use of freshly aliquoted ROCK inhibitors each time. Also, optimize minimum and gentle trituration to generate the single-cell suspension.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The COs generated contain mostly non-neuroepithelial tissues.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The generation of good quality COs depends on the quality of iPSC and the single-cell suspension. Even different clones of the same iPSC lines may produce COs with different efficiency. This is particularly the case for a protocol, such as this one, which is based on the spontaneous generation of neuroepithelium in the absence of any exogenously added patterning direction. For a new laboratory establishing this protocol, we recommend starting with a line, previously published to generate COs before moving into other lines of interest. The researcher must confirm that the iPSC quality is optimum before starting the procedure. The morphological quality of the iPSC colony can be evaluated by the compactness of the iPSC colony, defined ages, and high nucleolus to cytoplasm ratio. This evaluation requires experience in iPSC culture. It is critical to remove differentiated cells from iPSC culture before CO generation. The quality of the single-cell suspension is also crucial for quality CO generation. The researcher must ensure that single-cell suspension does not have a cluster of cells (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A). In addition, please make sure that single cells maintain spherical morphology with a regular border (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A). An irregular border may indicate apoptotic blebbing. Clusters and irregular morphology can be identified while counting cells using a hemocytometer. Use single-cell suspension with spherical cells and with no clusters. If these do not resolve the issue, please recheck the pluripotency and chromosomal integrity of the iPSC colony.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Leakage of non-solidified phantom brain mixture from the skull.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To avoid this situation, precaution measures are key. Before sterilization procedures, perform a brief test filling the skull with PBS. However, if the sterilization procedure was conducted and the skull is being prepared to receive the cerebral organoids and leaks of the liquid stage of the phantom brain mix are observed, do not complete the total volume. Instead, load only a few drops and keep the skull steady, wait for 3–5 min, and continue adding the phantom brain mix. Superficial tension and solidification of the small amount used will help to overcome the problem.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Cerebral organoids trapped inside the skull after impact.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If an organoid is trapped after impact, try to recover it by adding sterile PBS to the skull window. Excessive and direct manipulation of the sample is not desired. After adding PBS, remove the skull from the stereotaxic frame and try to transfer the sample by flipping the skull upside down. To avoid this situation, double-check the volume of phantom brain mix was adequate, and no pockets were left between the skull bone and the solidified mixture.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Rupture of brain organoids after impact.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The benefit of the CCI technique is the possibility of calibration of impact parameters. Double-check the deepness of impact on the CCI setup and recalibrate accordingly. Consider including a trial to evaluate the best parameters for your organoids, also consider including organoid transfer procedures to the skull and back to the culture plates. This will help you to train the fine motor skills required in this procedure.</p>
