<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The oral mucosa is an important site for virus infection and transmission, yet few animal models exist to examine the virology, pathology, and immunology of acute oral mucosal viral infection. Here, we provide a protocol for infecting and imaging the inner lip (labial mucosa) of mice with the poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV). Inoculation of the labial mucosa with a bifurcated needle results in viral replication and priming of an adaptive antiviral response that can be imaged using intravital microscopy.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00496-2/sref3">Shannon et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Investigators should obtain necessary institutional approvals for procedures involving infectious agents and animals. VACV is a biosafety level 2 pathogen and should be handled under appropriate conditions.</p>
<p>Working with vaccinia virus may require vaccination of both laboratory personnel and animal husbandry personnel.</p>
<p>Animal studies must be approved by an institutional animal care and use committee (ACUC) before any experiments begin. All animal studies should be performed in accord with ACUC guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">VACV growth</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 days</div>
<ol>
<li>Plate 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> 143B (human thymidine kinase (TK<sup>-</sup>) cells) in 30 mL of cell culture medium (See <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section) per T150 tissue culture flask. Place flasks in humidified tissue-culture incubator at 37°C with 9% CO<sub>2</sub> overnight. All subsequent tissue-culture incubation steps are performed under these conditions unless directly noted.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We culture 143B cells in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) which has a high concentration of sodium bicarbonate. To obtain appropriate pH, higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> may be used. While CO<sub>2</sub> levels can range from ∼ 5%–12% we have had good luck with 9%. Minimum essential medium (MEM) can also be used to culture cells, if so, we recommend using a lower CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (∼5%) to account for lower levels of sodium bicarbonate.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Although passage number can be a concern with immortalized cell lines, we have not detected observable differences in virus growth with older passages of the cells. Allowing the cells to overgrow should be avoided, however, as this can decrease viral titers and impair plaque assays performed with these cells (discussed below). It is advisable to passage cells at least once before growing virus to make sure the cells are healthy and grow well.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Confirm each flask has a confluent monolayer of cells and then thaw a VACV stock and calculate the volume of virus needed to infect at the desired multiplicity of infection (MOI) using the formula below. A confluent flask of TK- cells has ∼2.5 × 107 cell and should be infected with a MOI of 0.1–0.5 for best results.</li>

<p>For example: (2.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> × 85% confluency × 0.1 PFU/cell)/(2.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> PFU/mL) =106 μls of virus stock added to 10 mls of infection medium</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add the volume of virus calculated above to 10 mL of infection medium (See <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section).</li>
<li>Remove medium from each T150 flask and add 10 mL of infection medium containing virus to each flask. Ensure the entire surface of the flask is covered.</li>
<li>Place flasks in humidified tissue culture 37°C incubator with 9% CO<sub>2</sub> for 2 h. Gently rock the flasks every 15–30 min.</li>
<li>Add 20 mL of cell culture medium to each flask without removing infection medium containing virus (We typically infect 10–15 flasks for each viral stock which gives us ∼ 100 mL of virus at 2E8 PFU/mL). Incubate for 48 h at 37°C with 9% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>

<h3 id="sec1.2">VACV harvest and aliquoting</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3.5 h</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Confirm the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE) in each flask. Cells should be rounded and either floating or lightly adherent to flasks before harvest.</li>
<li>Gently tap the flasks to detach cells and transfer contents to a conical bottom 225 mL centrifuge tube.</li>
<li>Spin at 870 × <i>g</i> at 4°C for 30 min.</li>
<li>Aspirate media and resuspend cell pellet in 10 mL of ice-cold HBSS + 0.1% BSA (See <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section).</li>
<li>Transfer resuspended pellet into a sterile 50 mL Falcon tube. Rinse 225 mL centrifuge tube with an additional 5 mL of HBSS + 0.1% BSA and transfer to 50 mL Falcon tube, the final volume will be ∼ 15 mL.</li>
<li>Freeze/thaw resuspended pellet three times on dry ice and then in a 37°C water bath, respectively.</li>
<li>Carefully pour mixture into a sterile 15 mL Dounce homogenizer and place on ice.</li>
<li>Slowly homogenize by moving the pestle up and down while keeping on ice until the solution is uniform.</li>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The freeze/thaw and homogenization lyse cells and releases cell-associated virus. These steps must be followed to obtain maximum virus yield. The freeze-thaw can be performed at room temp or at 37°C in a water bath, pending time.</div>

<li>Pipette mixture back into the 50 mL Flacon tube from homogenizer and place on ice.</li>
<li>Rinse the homogenizer with an additional 10 mL of ice-cold HBSS + 0.1% BSA and transfer to the 50 mL Falcon tube with mixture from step 15. Bring the volume of the tube up to 50 mL with ice-cold HBSS + 0.1% BSA.</li>
<li>Place the 50 mL tube in a cup horn sonicator. Add ice to the cup holder and sonicate for 30 s at 30% power. Repeat process 4 times, equaling a total time of 2 min.</li>
<li>Perform a quick spin to remove the cellular membranes. Centrifuge at 870 × <i>g</i> for 5–10 s.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The quick spin process removes most cell debris. Virus may be purified through a sucrose gradient using standard virological approaches if a virus preparation entirely devoid of cell debris is desired.</div>

<li>Gently pour the supernatant into a sterile 125 mL media bottle and place on ice.</li>
<li>Add 10 mL of ice-cold HBSS + 0.1% BSA to wash and break up pellet, then add another 20 mL of ice-cold HBSS + 0.1% BSA bringing the total volume to 30 mL.</li>
<li>Place the 50 mL tube in the sonicator and sonicate for 30 s at 40% power.</li>
<li>Repeat the quick spin process, as described in step 18.</li>
<li>Pour supernatant into the 125 mL media bottom containing the previous supernatant.</li>
<li>Wash the pellet as described in step 20 and repeat the sonication and quick spin steps. Add supernatant to the 125 mL media bottle. The final volume should be ∼ 110 mL.</li>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Do not let cells grow past confluency prior to performing the plaque assay. Avoid moving plates during the 48 h incubation step to minimize the potential of satellite colonies. When determining titers by plaque assay, wells with 5–50 plaques should be counted. Counting too few plaques reduces accuracy of quantification; at high densities plaques may merge and be difficult to distinguish.</div>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Labial mucosal infection of mice with VACV</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1<b>–</b><b>2 h</b>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Prepare VACV inoculum:
<ol type="a">
<li>Thaw a 1 mL vial of virus on ice and sonicate for 45 s at 70% power.</li>
<li>Transport virus to vivarium on ice.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Infection of the oral mucosa:
<ol type="a">
<li>Anesthetize mice with approved inhaled or injectable anesthetic (such as isoflurane or avertin).</li>
<li>Once the mouse is sedated, using a pipette tip, place a small drop of virus (∼ 10 μL) at the desired concentration (PFU/mL, see below) inside the lower lip (labial mucosa), which forms a small pocket (see Notes).</li>
<li>Gently poke the mucosa with a bifurcated needle. Alternate: Instead of placing a drop of virus on the lip, the bifurcated needle can be dipped in the virus stock (see <a href="#mmc2">Methods video S1</a>) and then the virus held by the needle is gently poked into the labial mucosa.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The bifurcated needle was designed for human inoculation with the live-virus smallpox vaccine. The needle is dipped into the reconstituted vaccine (containing infectious VACV). One dose of the vaccine is then held in a thin layer between the needle’s prongs (see <a href="#mmc2">Methods video S1</a>). The needle is then used to poke the skin of vaccinees 15 times.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> While we have inoculated mice using a dipped needle, we most commonly inoculate mice by placing a small drop of virus in the lip and gently poking 5–10 pokes through the drop of virus with a bifurcated needle (see (<a href="#bib3">Shannon et al., 2021</a>) for viral titers over time with this inoculum of virus). Viral titers can be increased or decreased with more or fewer pokes. More pokes will result in more morbidity and mice should be carefully monitored (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</div>

<li>Wipe the inner lip with sterile gauze to remove any remaining VACV.</li>
<li>Monitor mice until they recover fully from anesthesia.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Thus far we have tested the lip (labial mucosa), tongue and cheek (buccal mucosa) for permissible infection. We have also successfully infected the murine labial mucosa with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 strain SC16.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Although we have not found dramatic differences in the protocols between strains, we cannot rule out strain- or sex-specific differences, particularly in anesthesia requirements. Mouse age and weight do impact infection and viral titers (with young mice having higher viral titers), so this should be taken into consideration.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Two steps are critical when infecting the labial mucosa: 1) ensure that viral inoculum is not inhaled by the mouse during the initial infection (See <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) and 2) poke the mucosa only gently to prevent skin infection or excess bleeding. We have found that diluting the initial viral stock to 10<sup>4</sup> PFU/mL allows labial mucosal infection without lung infection due to inhalation.</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–8 h</div>

<li>Prepare mouse for intravital microcopy.
<ol type="a">
<li>Collect mouse from vivarium at desired time post-infection.</li>
<li>Place animal in induction chamber and induce anesthesia using 2% isoflurane. Alternatively, an injectable anesthetic can be used for initial anesthesia (we use avertin).</li>
<li>Sterilize the outer lip by alternating scrubs of Betadine and 70% ethanol, taking care not to disturb the labial mucosa.</li>
<li>Make two small incisions (approximately 2 mm) at the angles of the mouth using dissecting scissors. Limit the size of the incisions to prevent bleeding.</li>
<li>Using tweezers, very gently pull the lip through a mini-stage and attach using either Vetbond or cyanoacrylate adhesive. Manipulate the lip gently to avoid bruising this tissue. The lip should be placed as flatly as possible or the mucosa will be out of focus.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Different mini-stages can be used to stabilize the lip. We have a pre-made stainless steel mini-stage; however, a thin, double-sided razor blade trimmed of its sharp edges can also be used.</div>
</li>
<li>Place a water-based lubricating gel on the inner lip and turn mouse so that the lip makes stable, firm contact with a glass cover slip. Any air bubbles will prevent imaging.</li>

We have encountered good success imaging both GFP and ZsGreen expression in the oral mucosa. To visualize blood vessels in the lamina propria, fluorescently labeled CD31 antibody can be injected intravenously prior to surgical preparation.</div>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Infection of wild-type mice with VACV as described in the protocol should result in a robust infection of all animals that is controlled by the adaptive immune response within 14 days. Immunodeficient animals may succumb to infection.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>We have experienced variability in infections based on the location of mucosal infection; sometimes the location of infected cells prevents easy imaging. As mice are euthanized at the end of imaging periods before recovering from anesthesia, this method does not allow sequential imaging of the same animal at different points in time. As with any viral infection, the initial dose of the virus is critical and mouse age and inoculum should be consistent between groups.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Wild-type mice succumb to oral mucosal VACV infection. (See <a href="#sec3.1">labial mucosal infection of mice with VACV</a>, step 2).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Take care to avoid inhalation of the viral inoculum (leading to unintended lung infection). Use older mice or a lower number of pokes of virus.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Weak staining of specific cell surface antigens (markers) by flow cytometry. (See <a href="#sec3.3">enzymatic tissue digestion to process labial mucosal tissue</a>, step 17).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Try a different digestion method or decrease incubation period during digestion. Titrate antibodies between lots and with different fluorophores.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Inconsistent or low viral titers from harvested tissues. (See <a href="#sec3.4">determining VACV titer in the labial mucosa</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Change bifurcated needle after use on 5 mice (or fewer) to prevent the needle from dulling, thus impeding tissue penetration. Sonicate virus stock before infection.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Mice die during the intravital imaging process. (See <a href="#sec3.5">visualizing the labial mucosal immune response using intravital microscopy</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Reduce the percentage of isoflurane or use an injectable anesthetic (such as avertin). However, if using an injectable, it will require repeated administration of anesthetic to consistently keep mice under.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Cell motility is decreased or stops during intravital imaging period. (See <a href="#sec3.5">visualizing the labial mucosal immune response using intravital microscopy</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure that the heated chamber (recommended) or blanket is set to appropriate temperature. If using a heated chamber, it takes ∼ 2 h to reach the desired temperature.</p>
