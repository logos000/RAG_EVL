<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although viruses have been suggested to be a contributing environmental factor, conventional experimental MS mouse models do not account for this aspect. Here, we describe a mouse model to induce and evaluate demyelinating disease with both a viral and an immune component via ocular infection with a recombinant herpes simplex virus expressing murine interleukin-2.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib7">Hirose et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Experimental considerations</h3>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This protocol for inducing demyelinating disease complements the EAE mouse model of MS and induces clinical abnormalities similar to those seen in human patients of MS.</div>
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is infectious to humans, therefore it is necessary to follow national and institutional guidelines for safe handling of HSV-1. Before obtaining virus stock, consult with the lab safety department and animal facility in your institution and complete necessary paperwork. Following safety guidelines, we handle HSV-1 in biosafety cabinets. After the experiments, bleach treatment is used to inactivate the virus and decontaminate the tools; waste is disposed of as biohazardous waste.</p>
<p>All animal procedures described here, including ocular HSV-1 infection and euthanasia of mice, require approval by institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC). Under the approved protocol, all infected animals are housed in a separate room in the animal facility with low air pressure. Dissection of the infected mice is performed in a safety cabinet and the carcasses of infected mice are discarded in a designated manner.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> You should practice cryosectioning until you are proficient at it because good quality sectioning and staining of tissues are essential for evaluating demyelination correctly.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Maintaining RS cells</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–3 h</div>
<p>We use rabbit skin (RS) cells for amplifying and titering HSV-1 (<a href="#bib17">Perng et al., 1994</a>), since they grow very well and infect efficiently with HSV-1. RS cells are adherent cells that are grown on standard tissue-culture treated vessels without special treatment of the vessel surface, such as collagen coating. RS cells are cultured in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C and split every two to three days. Since culturing cells at low density results in poor cell growth, we recommend plating &gt;1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. RS cells can be frozen in 80% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 20% DMSO at −80°C. RS cells may not be readily available commercially, but can be requested from our laboratory.</p>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> The virus can also be amplified in other permissive cell lines for HSV-1, such as NIH3T3 and Vero cells, but requires optimization of culture conditions.</div>
<ol>
<li>Dissociate RS cells. The amounts reported are for a 10 cm culture dish. Change amounts according to your culture vessel.
<ol type="a">
<li>Aspirate RS cell culture medium.</li>
<li>Add 10 mL Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline and aspirate it to wash out remaining culture medium.</li>
<li>Add 2 mL of trypsin.</li>
<li>Incubate at 37°C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 3 to 5 min.</li>
<li>Dissociate cells completely by pipetting gently.</li>
<li>Add 5 mL medium and transfer cell suspension to centrifuge tubes.</li>
<li>Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × <i>g</i> at 22°C–25°C.</li>
<li>Remove supernatant and add warm culture medium.</li>
<li>Mix cells gently by pipetting.</li>
<li>Count cells using a hemocytometer or autonomous cell counter.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Seed cells at six-fold dilution to make the cells confluent in 2 days, or eight-fold dilution to make cells confluent in 3 days.</li>
<li>Place the culture vessels in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The expected cell number from a 10 cm plate at 80% confluency is approximately 7–10 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Preparation of HSV-1 stock</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–2 weeks</div>
<p>We generally amplify virus stocks in-house. Stocks can be requested from our laboratory or other laboratories working on HSV-1. Typically, we obtain &gt; 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> plaque forming units (PFU)/mL of HSV-1 from one T-75 flask.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Seed RS cells in several T-75 flasks at approximately 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/flask and grow for 12–16 h.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Count cells using a hemocytometer or autonomous cell counter after preparing the cell suspension (as in step 2c).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The cells will be confluent for infection the following day (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A).</div>

</li>
<li>Inoculate &gt;10 μL of virus suspension per well in a 12-well plate.</li>
<li>Incubate in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Swirl the plate every 15 min by hand for 1 h.</li>
<li>Remove the medium and add 1 mL/well of warm RS medium-1% methyl cellulose.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> To reduce diffusion of the virus particles from the plaque, the media should be replaced with a viscous one by supplementing methyl cellulose. Otherwise, all the cells will be lysed. Make sure that the 2% methyl cellulose and 2× RS cell culture medium are well mixed. If they are not mixed well and the concentration of methylcellulose is lower than 1%, the medium might not be viscous enough to prevent virus diffusion and will result in whole cell lysis.</div>
</li>
<li>Culture the plate for 2 to 3 days in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Cytopathic effects can be observed under an inverted microscope. Plaques are best counted on day 2 to 3, when they have an adequate size and separated from each other. After day 4, the plaques grow larger and start to overlap.</div>
</li>
<li>Remove the culture medium.</li>
<li>Add 0.5 mL of crystal violet solution.</li>
<li>Incubate at 22°C–25°C for at least 30 min.</li>
<li>Discard the crystal violet solution in a designated waste container.</li>
<li>Wash with running tap water several times, discarding waste per your institution’s protocol.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Bi-distilled water is not necessary. The type of the water does not affect the quality of the staining.</div>
</li>
<li>Count the plaques (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C) and calculate the titer as shown below.<br> <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/416-Si1.jpg" alt="Si1.jpg">
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> It is not necessary to remove the culture medium to stain cells with crystal violet solution, but staining will take approximately one day. Make sure the final methanol concentration is more than 30%, which is necessary to inactivate HSV-1.</div>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> If the titer of the virus is low, you can concentrate it using an ultracentrifuge. After precipitating the cell debris by centrifugation, transfer the supernatant to an ultracentrifuge tube, place it in a SW-28 rotor, and centrifuge at 87,000 × <i>g</i> for 1 h at 4°C. After centrifugation, decant the supernatant and resuspend the virus pellet gently by pipetting in the desired amount of cell culture media.

<h3 id="sec3.1">Transfer of immune cells to mice</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>To dissect the molecular and cellular mechanisms of demyelination induced by HSV1-IL-2, we infected HSV-IL-2 to various genetically engineered mice, or mice with adoptively transferred cells. We found that both type 2 innate lymphocytes (ILC2s) and T cells play a role in induction of demyelination, because mice lacking these cells did not develop demyelination following infection with HSV1-IL-2, whereas transfer of ILC2s isolated from wild-type mice into recipient ILC2-deficient mice (<a href="#bib7">Hirose et al., 2020</a>) or T cells isolated from wild-type mice into SCID mice (<a href="#bib20">Zandian et al., 2011a</a>) infected with HSV1-IL-2 restored the demyelination phenotype. In this section, we describe the method for intravenous injection of immune cells to test their function in this mouse model. After the transfer of the ILC2s or T cells, we waited two weeks for cells to settle down before infecting the mice with HSV-IL-2 virus. Female mice aged 7–9 weeks were used.</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolate ILC2 cells as described previously (<a href="#bib7">Hirose et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib12">Moro et al., 2015</a>) and transfer into a 1.5 mL tube.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol describes a method to induce demyelinating disease using a recombinant HSV-1 that expresses murine IL-2 (HSV-IL-2) as a model of human multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease that involves chronic inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration in CNS tissues.</p>
<p>We detected demyelinating plaques in the ON, SC and brain as “white” areas in LFB stained tissues (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). On day 14 post infection, 2 to 3 plaques per section were observed in brain and spinal cord from female mice infected with HSV-IL-2 (<a href="#bib14">Mott et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib15">Osorio et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#bib19">Zandian et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib20">Zandian et al., 2011a</a>; <a href="#bib21">Zandian et al., 2011b</a>). Demyelinating plaques were also detected after day 10 in the optic nerve of infected mice. No demyelination was detected in brain, spinal cord, or optic nerves of HSV-IL-2-infected mice on days 3 and 7 post infection. These lesions were not observed in mice infected with the parental virus, or similarly constructed recombinant viruses that express IL-4, IFN-γ, IL-12p35, or IL-12p40. Besides LFB staining, signs of demyelinating diseases can also be observed using other methods. Demyelination was confirmed by electron microscopy (<a href="#bib15">Osorio et al., 2005</a>), and optic neuropathy was shown by the detection of visual-evoked cortical potentials (VECPs) (<a href="#bib19">Zandian et al., 2009</a>).</p>
<p>With the RNA preparation method described here, 7–15 μg of total RNA were isolated from 20–40 sections. Since the portion of tissue varies among sections, the amount of RNA could be less, if the tissue within the sections is small. The A260/A280 ratios of the isolated RNA preparations were above 1.8 despite varying portions of OCT compound among the sections. Using the RNA isolated with this method, we performed RT-qPCR and observed good amplification of target genes including genes encoding cytokines and transcription factors.</p>
<p>Epidemiologic studies have suggested that certain viruses, as well as various genetic factors, are involved in the onset of MS. However, in traditional MS mouse models, such as experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), demyelination is induced by injecting a myelin component together with adjuvant, without virus involvement. Our model incorporates both a viral (HSV-1) and a genetic (IL-2) component and allows us to study virus-mediated mechanisms of pathogenesis and host response during the development of demyelinating disease, which are lacking in traditional models. The insights obtained through this model may lay the basis of development of novel therapies for MS.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Several viruses have been proposed to trigger autoimmune diseases such as MS. These viruses include several herpes viruses, such as HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, EBV, HHV-6, and HHV-7 (<a href="#bib1">Daibata et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib2">Ferrante et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib9">Knox et al., 2000</a>), as well as non-herpes viruses such as JC virus (JCV), Semiliki forest virus (SFV), human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1), Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (<a href="#bib3">Ferrante et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#bib5">Haider et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib6">Haring and Perlman, 2001</a>; <a href="#bib8">Jacobson et al., 1990</a>; <a href="#bib10">Miller et al., 2001</a>; <a href="#bib13">Morris et al., 1997</a>; <a href="#bib16">Parsons and Webb, 1989</a>). However, no direct link between viral infection and MS has been established. There are two major limitations of this mouse model for MS. First, the lack of validation in humans. The second is the potential confounding effect of gut microorganisms in this disease model. Gut microorganisms is yet another factor recently associated with disease in the mouse EAE model (<a href="#bib11">Miyauchi et al., 2020</a>) and may influence the outcome in this disease model. Although the mice are usually kept in a specific pathogen-free environment, the gut microorganisms are not monitored and are known to vary among facilities. The variability in gut microorganisms may change the incidence of the disease among institutions.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Low titer of HSV-1 viruses.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The virus titer should be at least 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> pfu/μL for ocular infection. If the virus titer is lower, possible causes could be cell density or cell culture conditions. Consider using cells at a relatively low number of passages. We typically use cells below 20 passages. While cells should have enough media to completely cover the monolayer, too much media may result in dilute virus concentration. We have found that 10 mL of media works well for T-75 flasks. Reducing the medium immediately before freezing flasks did not improve the titer, probably because a significant portion of virus is already secreted into the media at this point. Another reason for low virus titer may be caused by ending virus production either too early or too late. For optimal results, cells should be frozen when most cells are rounded. We generally simply use ultracentrifugation to concentrate the virus.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Low quality sections.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Temperature during sectioning is important. If it is too low, sections will be shattered with countless number of slits. A chamber setting of −18°C when sectioning the ON, SC, and the brain works very well for us. Melt any ice from chamber including the thermal sensors to ensure they work properly. Still, optimization of the temperature might be necessary, because of errors in thermal sensors or differences in instrumental environment. The condition of the blade is also important. Use one that is intact and handle it carefully in order not to damage it. Blades from some companies may require frequent changing. If you find that the tissue dissociates from the compound and rolls up, this is due to a gap forming between the tissue and compound. In this case, you can fill the gap with OCT compound using a plastering technique. Since brain is not too watery or fat-rich, there will be few difficulties in sectioning this tissue.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Poor staining.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Optimization of signal-to-noise ratio (steps 23, 24, 27) is necessary and potential solutions depend on your staining method. LFB destains quickly, so we go through steps 23 and 24 in a very short time. If you see precipitation on the specimen, it likely indicates that the LFB solution has precipitated and needs to be replaced. We typically store the solution in a tightly closed bottle and/or with parafilm sealing for up to six months at 22°C–25°C. Cresyl violet staining is more stable and produces non-specific staining, so it takes thorough washing to see good signal over the background. If the specimen is stained too long, it will be dark, and the excess staining will not come off even with multiple washes. Low signal or faint staining could be the result of repeated reusing of the Cresyl violet stain, or using a stain that is too old.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Low RNA yield.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Preventing RNase contamination is essential. Make sure that all the reagents and tools are RNase free. Also, bacterial contamination is a potential source of RNase. Consider replacing reagents with RNase-free, fresh ones if possible. Aliquot reagents for one time use only. If the tool is not disposable, wipe with decontaminating reagent such as RNase away. Alternatively, tools can be soaked in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, chloroform, or 0.1 M NaOH-1 mM EDTA depending on their resistance to these chemicals. Use caution when handling reagents during the experiment. Change your gloves frequently and make sure that your fingers do not contact the inside of tubes and containers. Another major reason for low RNA yield is that tissues were either not homogenized enough in Trizol and/or warmed up before homogenization was complete. Make sure that there are no large pieces left in the homogenate and keep it on ice.</p>
