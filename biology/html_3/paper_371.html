<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Synapses are crucial to brain function and frequent disease targets, but current analysis methods cannot report on individual synaptic components <i>in situ</i> or present barriers to widespread adoption. SEQUIN was developed to address this challenge. SEQUIN utilizes a widely available super-resolution platform in tandem with image processing and analysis to quantify synaptic loci over large regions of brain and characterize their molecular and nanostructural properties at the individual and population level. This protocol describes quantification of synaptic loci using SEQUIN.</p>
<p>For additional details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib1">Sauerbeck et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec2.1">Immunofluorescent labeling</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5–9 days</div>
<p>Immunofluorescent labeling of synaptic proteins allows for visualization and identification of synaptic loci based on measured separation distances between pre- and postsynaptic markers. This protocol demonstrates dual-antibody fluorescent labeling of 50 μm free-floating sections using antibodies against the presynaptic marker synapsin and the postsynaptic marker PSD-95. Below we present two possible anti-synapsin antibodies that can be used. Guinea pig anti-synapsin 1/2 is a convenient choice to avoid species cross-reactivity. Mouse anti-synapsin 1 is a suitable option as well that limits lot-to-lot variability. NOTE: SEQUIN has been validated in female and male mice 8 weeks-18 months of age.</p>

<li>Fill 1 L beaker with distilled water.</li>
<li>Using a clean paintbrush, carefully move sections to netwells. Ensure sections are fully submerged.</li>
<li>Rinse on shaker at low speed for 5 min.</li>
<li>Fill another 6 well plate with PBS and move netwells from first plate to second.</li>
<li>Rinse on shaker at low speed for 5 min.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1e and 1f for 3 washes total.</li>

</li>
<li>Block in 20% Normal Goat Serum (NGS) blocking buffer to prevent non-specific antibody binding (see “<a href="#before-you-begin">Before you begin</a>”).
<ol type="a">
<li>Add blocking buffer to wells of a separate plate: ∼500 μL/well for a 24 well plate (up to 4 sections/well); ∼750 μL/well for a 12 well plate (up to 8 sections/well).</li>
<li>Using a clean paintbrush, carefully move sections from netwells with PBS to plates with blocking buffer.</li>
<li>Cover and incubate at 20°C–24°C (room temperature) on shaker at low speed for 1 h.</li>

When mixed 1:1 with a master mix of the other primary antibody (or with an equivalent volume of antibody buffer for the no-primary or channel alignment controls), the final working concentration is 1×. For experiments entailing &gt;2 primary antibodies, master mixes will need to be further concentrated (e.g., 3× for 3 antibodies). Mix well.</li>

<p>The below protocol describes a typical acquisition suitable for SEQUIN analysis. Other parameters may suffice or be necessary for certain experimental aims.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Set up microscope.
<ol type="a">
<li>Turn on Zeiss Airyscan microscope.</li>
<li>Turn on light source.</li>
<li>Select 63× 1.4 NA oil objective on the microscope display.</li>
<li>Clean objective with lens cleaner.</li>
<li>Mount Z-Piezo, a slide holder allowing for greater precision in Z translation.</li>
<li>Apply Zeiss 518F immersion oil to objective.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Configure software.
<ol type="a">
<li>Open the Zen Black software, click “start system.”
<ol type="i">
<li>While software loads, ensure slide is clean. (Note: use distilled water and lens cleaner to clean the cover glass.)</li>
<li>Insert slide in Z-Piezo and tighten knobs securing slide until finger-tight. Slide should be firmly immobilized. If performing long/unsupervised scans slide should be first loosely placed in the piezo and then firmly secured with dental wax.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Navigate to “Maintain” tab.
<ol type="i">
<li>Confirm objective listed in the software matches objective shown in the freestanding microscope control box.</li>
<li>In the “System Options” box, navigate to the “Hardware” tab and ensure “Extended Z-Piezo” is unchecked.</li>
<li>Navigate to the Airyscan menu within this tab and ensure “Adjust in continuous scans” and “Weak or sparse samples” are checked and “Adjust in slow time series” is unchecked.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Set experimental parameters.
<ol type="a">
<li>Move to “Acquisitions” tab.
<ol type="i">
<li>Choose “8-bit” bit depth.</li>
<li>Choose “bidirectional” scan mode.</li>
<li>Use a zoom of greater or equal to 1.8× to facilitate post-acquisition Airyscan processing.</li>
<li>Choose “Line” scan mode.</li>
<li>Design appropriate light paths to image the fluorophores being used.
<ol type="a">
<li>For each light path, select the appropriate laser to be used. For the fluorophores applied in this protocol, the 488 and 561 nm laser lines are used.</li>
<li>Open pinhole to maximum size.</li>
<li>Set gain to 800.</li>
<li>Configure the light path. For the above fluorophores on the Airyscan system, the 488/561 main beam splitter is one appropriate option. Set the secondary beam splitter to “Plate” and the emission filter to “BP 420–480 + BP 495–620” (these emission filters allow for line scan imaging of both fluorophores).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Click “Optimal” to set XY pixel resolution of all channels selected. Note that all channels being imaged should be selected before clicking “Optimal.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Navigate to region of interest (ROI) using epifluorescence light source and oculars (“Locate” tab in Zen Black).</li>
<li>Set up imaging Z-stack.
<ol type="a">
<li>Ensure “Z-stack” is enabled in the top left corner of the “Acquisitions” tab.</li>

<li>Set Z-stack configuration to “First-Last” mode.</li>
<li>Select one of the laser channels and click “Live” in the top left panel of the “Acquisitions” tab.</li>
<li>Using Z-Piezo control knob, find the cut edge of the tissue at the cover glass. (NOTE: it may help to “Best fit” the display parameters to visualize signal.)</li>
<li>Find the most superficial Z position that avoids irregularity at the cut surface (the first optical section in which the entire field is intact) and choose “set first” in the Z-stack control windows.</li>
<li>Rotate the piezo focus control to find the deepest tissue section that avoids surface irregularity and select “set last.”</li>
<li>Navigate to the center of the stack (click “c” on the Z-stack diagram in the “Z-stack” window).</li>
<li>Within the Z-stack window, set the step size (“Interval”) to 120 nm to modestly oversample in Z, and set the number of optical sections (“Slices”) to 35. Note that other stack thicknesses (number of optical sections) or step sizes (Z intervals) may be appropriate for a given experiment, though increasing step size will lead to some reduction in Z-resolution and puncta detection (with the advantage of faster scan speeds).</li>
<li>Scroll through the entirety of the now shorter stack (4.08 μm centered in the section) and ensure qualitative suitability of all optical sections (NOTE: see “<a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>” section for examples of problematic optical sections).</li>
<li>Turn off “Live” mode.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Align Airyscan detector.
<ol type="a">
<li>Turn on “Continuous mode.”</li>
<li>While continuous mode is running, open the Airyscan view on the display window. A display of the 32 detectors is depicted. The brightest detector should be the central element. If not, give the scope several moments to auto-adjust. Do not proceed until the brightest detector is centered.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Set up laser ramping.
<ol type="a">
<li>Check the “Z-correction” box in the Z-stack window.</li>
<li>Select the first channel to laser ramp for and start “Continuous” mode.</li>
<li>Move to the deepest position of the Z-stack.</li>
<li>Change the laser intensity of the selected channel until the lower 1/3 of the dynamic range of pixel intensity is occupied, as represented by the histogram in the “Display” tab.</li>
<li>Move to the first position in the Z-stack and find the laser intensity that best replicates the signal acquired at the deepest position.</li>
<li>Repeat this for all channels.</li>
<li>When desired laser ramp is set for all channels, move back to the most superficial position, select all channels, and enter the laser intensity for the first position for each. Then, click “Add position” in the Z-stack window.</li>
<li>Move to the last position and repeat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ensure acquisition speed is set to maximum.</li>
<li>Now, select “begin experiment” to begin the scan (duration is approximately 5 min for above parameters).</li>
<li>When image acquisition is complete, save image. Before proceeding with further imaging, Airyscan process the image (see Image Processing below) and check the orthogonal view to ensure consistent Z intensity (see <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>). If brightness is not consistent, move to a different field and reset the laser ramp.</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> dependent on computational resources; &lt;1 min/image (automated) on high-end workstations</div>
<p>Using MATLAB, Euclidian distances between the centroids of pre- and postsynaptic puncta are measured for each pre- or postsynaptic punctum in 3 dimensions, yielding raw as well as binned separation data (sorted by separation distance). One marker, which can be pre- or postsynaptic, is used as the reference dataset, and the nearest neighbor from the other dataset will be matched to each puncta in the referenced set (while either pre- or postsynaptic puncta can serve as the reference dataset, all examples shown reference PSD-95). All needed code is available on GitHub (see <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a>). The Pre-to-Postsynaptic Puncta Separation Analysis utilizes two MATLAB codes (“SEQUINv3.m” and “compileExceldocs_SEQUINv3.m”), each with an associated txt file that specifies their parameters (“Analysis parameters.txt” and “Compile Excel Docs parameters.txt,” respectively). The general protocol involves specifying the parameters and running the analysis with SEQUINv3.m, then compiling the data with compileExceldocs_SEQUINv3.m with its user-specified parameters.</p>
<p>In many cases, only the top 20% brightest pre- and postsynaptic puncta are analyzed. Spots of lower intensity contain fewer puncta pairs consistent with synapses, though this is dependent on antibody and marker choice and should be experimentally determined (<a href="#bib1">Sauerbeck et al., 2020</a>). We recommend puncta separation analysis is performed on a system containing at minimum a multicore processor and 8 GB RAM.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>When the technique is performed as described in healthy brain tissue, one expects to see a bimodal histogram of pre-to-postsynaptic separation distances. The first peak, typically found at 150–200 nm, represents pre-postsynaptic marker pairs separated by distances ultrastructurally consistent with synapses. The second peak, found at longer separation distances, represents non-synaptic associations in the volume (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). The area under the first peak (quantified as described below) corresponds to the quantity of synaptic loci within the imaged volume. In the setting of certain forms of acute injury (<a href="#bib1">Sauerbeck et al., 2020</a>), neurodegenerative processes (<a href="#bib1">Sauerbeck et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib2">Terry et al., 1991</a>; <a href="#bib3">Gratuze et al., 2020</a>) or other processes that reduce synapse number, the area under this peak is expected to be lower compared to controls.</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>To perform a basic quantification of synaptic loci, sum all puncta counts falling to the left of an experimentally determined cutoff (for example, &lt; 250 nm pre-to-postsynaptic separation, or the trough between the first and second peak). Given variability between experimental models and conditions, this cutoff point may vary for different applications (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).</p>
<p>The early peak may be more completely “disentangled” from the broad second peak by incorporating “flipped” data into the analysis, or modeling the pre-to-postsynaptic separation histogram as a mixture of two Gaussians (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). For the “flipped” analysis, spots data for one of the marker channels (pre- or postsynaptic) are first reflected across the Y axis and then the nearest neighbor analysis is undertaken with the paired, unaltered marker channel coordinates (e.g., the PSD-95 spots coordinates are reflected and a separation analysis is performed with un-reflected synapsin spot coordinates). Plotting the flipped data (MATLAB, R, GraphPad Prism, etc.) should yield a unimodal distribution indicative only of random pairings. This data can be found in the generated spreadsheet in the tab “Flipped Frequency.” These random pairings can then be subtracted from the prior (unflipped) nearest neighbor analysis on a bin-wise basis. The results of this subtraction can be found in the sheet titled “Flip Subtraction Frequency.” Plotting the flip subtraction data should yield a sharp early peak with a minimal or negative second peak. Finally, the “Flip Sub Zeros Frequency” uses the same algorithm to remove random pairings as found in the “Flipped Frequency,” but subsequently zeros any biologically meaningless negative values.</p>

</figure>
<p>2-Gaussian modeling can be performed with a number of graphing and analysis packages (MATLAB, R, GraphPad Prism, etc.). In this case the first of the 2 resulting Gaussians represents paired puncta consistent with synaptic loci, while the second (at a longer separation distance) represents random pairings.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>SEQUIN has only been validated in aldehyde-fixed tissue.</p>
<p>The quality of refractive index-matching currently limits the depth at which SEQUIN can be applied. With this protocol, SEQUIN analysis becomes challenging at depths greater than 50 μm from the cut surface.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem</h3>
<p>The synapse peak is minimal or indistinguishable from the noise peak (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>).</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Lack of a typical bimodal frequency distribution of pre-to-postsynaptic separations with a clear early peak and broader following peak could be due to a variety of problems occurring in the tissue preparation, labeling, and/or imaging steps. We present a strategy to isolate the problem. Working backward:</p>
<p><b>Quality check image analysis workflow:</b> Repeat quantification on imaging data that has historically yielded expected results (or use sample data provided at <a href="https://github.com/KummerLab/SEQUIN">https://github.com/KummerLab/SEQUIN</a>) in tandem with experimental images. Repeat analysis of historical data should yield identical results.</p>
<p><b>Quality check imaging workflow:</b> Compare previous and current quantification of the previously immunolabeled and validated sample (imaging validation sample; <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>) that was imaged as a historical control. While quantification is not expected to be identical, an image from the same region using the same filter settings should yield a similar frequency distribution vs. historical data. Additional quality checks should include:</p>

<p>This indicates an XY shift of the stage during image acquisition.
