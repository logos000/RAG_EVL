<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>During the earliest division stages, zebrafish embryos have large cells that divide rapidly and synchronously to create a cellular layer on top of the yolk. Here, we describe a protocol for monitoring spindle dynamics during these early embryonic divisions. We outline techniques for injecting zebrafish embryos with small-molecule inhibitors toward polo-like kinases, preparing and mounting embryos for three-dimensional imaging using confocal microscopy. These techniques are used to understand how the early zebrafish embryo’s centrosome constructs the mitotic spindle.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Rathbun et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>Introduce different agents, such as small-molecule inhibitors (in our case BI2536 and Centrinone) or vehicle control (in our case DMSO) into the developing embryo. This step should be performed when embryos are at the 1-cell stage.</p>
<div class="note">

<li>Preparing embryos for injection
<ol type="a">
<li>Add embryo water to the injection plate.</li>
<li>Transfer the embryos carefully to the plate using a transfer pipette (refer to <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a> for catalog number).</li>
<li>Using a glass pipette with a melted tip, carefully push the embryos into the troughs. Be sure to leave space at the end of each row to make removing embryos from the rows easier (See <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> for example).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Calibrating your needle
<ol type="a">
<li>Using the Stereomicroscope, cut the needle with forceps. The needles are fused at the end when made with a needle puller. Verify that the needle is no longer fused after cutting so that liquid can flow through the needle.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The location that the needle is cut by the forceps determines the thickness/flexibility of the needle. If the needle is too thin, it will be too flimsy to poke through the chorion without breaking. If this is the case, the needle can be cut again with forceps to remove a bit more length. However, the needle also needs to be thin enough to poke through the chorion and embryos without causing significant damage. If the needle is causing significant damage to the embryo upon injection, a new needle should be loaded and cut.</div>
</li>
<li>After cutting the needle, zoom into 5× magnification on the microscope (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D). Adjust the injection time and pressure (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>F) until a liquid droplet that is 6 μm in diameter is formed. This produces a droplet of approximately 1 nL.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If the liquid droplet is changing in size, the balance on the microinjector (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>F) needs to be adjusted with the balance knob. Turn this knob gently until the droplet maintains a consistent size on the needle.</div>
</li>
<li>Once the needle is cut and calibrated, you are able to inject.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Injecting
<ol type="a">
<li>Turn your injector plates until the troughs run at a diagonal. This will ensure that you do not puncture the agarose and break the needle (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C for example).</li>
<li>Position the needle so that the x axis knob on the micromanipulator is the only one you need to adjust to inject the embryos (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E).</li>
<li>To inject, use the micromanipulator to puncture the embryo with the needle targeting the yolk. Press the foot pedal, remove the needle, and move the plate to the next embryo. Ensure that the needle is removed from the embryo before the plate is adjusted so that the embryo is not damaged.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>After injecting
<ol type="a">
<li>Once done, carefully adjust the micromanipulator to bring the needle as high as possible above the plate. Remove the needle from the micromanipulator and dispose of it in the sharp’s container.</li>
<li>Use the glass pipette with melted tip to remove the embryos from their troughs. Push the embryo upwards to dislodge it and collect embryos in a 60 mm petri-plate for incubation at 28.5°C until fixing/imaging.</li>
<li>Using DI water, rinse the agarose plate and store upside down in the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Turn off the microinjector and close the gas tank.</li>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Image acquisition and processing</h3>
<p>A Leica SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) was used (Leica, Bannockburn, IL). Imaging was performed using an HCX PL FLUOTAR 10×/0.32 or HC PL APO 40×/1.10 W CORR CS2 0.65 water immersion objective. Images were acquired using LAS-X software and using lightning, a built-in adaptive deconvolution algorithm (<a href="https://downloads.leica-microsystems.com/Leica%20TCS%20SP8/Publications/LIGHTNING_WhitePaper.pdf">https://downloads.leica-microsystems.com/Leica%20TCS%20SP8/Publications/LIGHTNING_WhitePaper.pdf</a>). Acquired Images were processed using FIJI/ImageJ software or Imaris (BitPlane). Imaris is primarily used for free-rotating volumetric visualization of the embryo, whereas FIJI/ImageJ is used for all maximum projections of stacked optical images obtained from embryos.</p>
<p>Parameter selection on a confocal is based on the signal to noise ratio of the fluor being imaged within a specific embryo (refer to Problem 2 for troubleshooting). Thus, specific parameters for laser scanning confocal acquisition vary from embryo to embryo. In our experiments, we have typically found 10% power for 405 laser (50 mW maximum power), 7% for 488 (65 mW maximum power) and 5% for 647 to be ideal. We used optimal z-step size, which is automatically calculated by the Leica software for the objective we use to achieve Nyquist sampling. Bidirectional scanning was performed at a set speed of 700 frames/s. We used the zoom function to make sure the embryo takes up the full field of view (typically ranges between 1.28 and 1.5). We started with a low “Gain” and increased it for each channel until the signal of structure of interest was clearly distinguishable from background and signal to noise seemed sufficient. For spindle length analysis, we imaged embryos with a 10× objective as shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>, with x-y dimensions of 0.68 × 0.68 mm<sup>2</sup> (1,024 by 1,024 pixel<sup>2</sup>). Leica’s SP8 user manual and training guide for imaging with the microscope can be found online, see the following link for pdf: <a href="https://bsir.bio.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu1511/files/leica-sp8-user-guide.pdf">https://bsir.bio.fsu.edu/sites/g/files/upcbnu1511/files/leica-sp8-user-guide.pdf</a></p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Quantification of cell length and spindle length</h3>
<p>We measured cell and spindle length using agarose-mounted embryos. Both measurements were performed on FIJI/ImageJ maximum confocal projections by drawing a line from one end of the structure to the other. For cell length, the length of a line extending along the longest cell axis (usually in the same orientation as mitotic centrosomes) from one side of the membrane to the other was measured for each cell (see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A). For spindle length, the length of a line extending from the center of one mitotic centrosome to the other was measured for each cell (see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B).</p>

<p>Representative zoomed in images of a 16-cell stage embryo imaged using an HCX PL FLUOTAR 10×/0.32 objective with manually labeled Fiji measurements of cell length (A), spindle length (B) and centrosome area (C). Length measurements were performed using the “straight line segment” tool highlighted with cyan box (A, B). Centrosome area was traced and measured using the “free selection” tool highlighted in cyan box (C).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Quantification of centrosome area</h3>
<p>To measure the 2-dimensional area of the centrosome, we used FIJI/ImageJ to draw a boundary around the centrosome in a confocal maximum projection and calculated the area within that boundary (see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>C).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In some cases, embryo cells were hard-mounted (refer to <a href="#mmc3">Methods Video S3</a>) or the whole embryo was agar-mounted for these studies (<a href="#mmc2">Methods Video S2</a>). When we remove the cells monolayer from the yolk and hard-mount the cells on a glass coverslip, the cells are flattened so that they do not curve along the surface compared to when embryos are agar-mounted and still have their yolk. In this case, 3-dimensional volumetric measurements of the centrosome can be performed using Imaris. When doing this we found no difference in the trend in centrosome sizes between volumetric measurements and 2-dimensional area when hard-mounting the embryos. Therefore, we used the 2-dimensional area as a measure of centrosome size featured in <a href="#bib3">Rathbun et al., 2020</a>.</div>

<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>There are different advantages and disadvantages associated with imaging fixed and live embryos. For fixed embryos, hard-mounting is a great tool for studying 2-dimensional structures, and it allows for imaging a larger number of embryos with better resolution due to the short working distance that results from flattening the embryo’s cells. Additionally, the cells of hard-mounted embryos can be preserved for prolonged amounts of time. However, the flattening of the cells with hard-mounting limits the information that can be obtained about the embryos’ morphology, such as the overall shape or volume of the cells. If shape of cells needs to be maintained, agarose mounting of live and/or fixed embryos is suggested. This is because agarose mounting does not flatten the cells and allows for preservation of the embryo’s structure. However, fixed embryos that are mounted with agarose will not last longer than 24 h, so imaging time is limited and needs to occur the same day they are mounted. Agarose mounting is great for live studies because it provides an appropriate environment for the embryo while holding it in place. However, live imaging restricts the number of embryos that can be imaged in a single imaging session due to time constraints, and the thickness of the embryo can also limit the depth of imaging.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Embryonic lethality following injection trauma (<a href="#sec3.1">Chemical injections of embryos</a>, step 6).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Injection trauma can result from injecting too high a concentration of a small-molecule inhibitor. Thus, a titration protocol for drug concentration is highly recommended for maximum optimization. Make sure to control for injection trauma using a vehicle control such as DMSO or water depending on the solubility of the small-molecule inhibitor used.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Decreased signal to noise ratio for γ-tubulin staining (Refer to <a href="#sec5.1">Image acquisition and processing</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are many reasons for sub-optimal signal to noise ratios following immunofluorescent protocols. First, the dilution of the primary antibody (in our case an antibody toward human γ-tubulin) might not be optimized for use in zebrafish embryos. Try performing a titration in antibody dilutions starting at 1:100 and going to 1:1,000 dilutions. Second, when testing a new antibody, it is good to check conservation in protein sequences between the species recognized by the antibody compared to zebrafish. In our case, γ-tubulin is highly conserved, and we get optimal signal to noise ratios at 1:200 dilution.</p>
