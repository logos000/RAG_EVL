<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>These protocols investigate the interaction of cytonemes with localized Wnt. Cell-niche signaling between naive or primed mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and either Wnt-secreting trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) or Wnt signals tethered to microbeads can be scrutinized <i>in vitro</i>. This approach analyzes cytoneme reactivity during Wnt-interaction initiation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at Wnt-contacting cytonemes, and subsequent pairing between ESCs and Wnt-sources. This pairing interaction is crucial to synthetic embryogenesis; hence this protocol is effective for <i>in vitro</i> studies of developmental biology.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The protocols below describe the specific steps required to prepare the cells used in our experiments, including ESCs and TSCs, as well as the steps followed to transition ESCs to primed ESCs, and how to prepare ESC lines expressing GCaMP6s or Ftractin-mRuby3. Also, we briefly describe the preparation and testing of immobilized Wnt3a microbeads, although a comprehensive step-by-step protocol can be found in (<a href="#bib10">Lowndes et al., 2017</a>)</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Culture of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5 days to several weeks</div>
<p>This protocol describes the thawing, culture and passaging of ESCs. The use of low-passage ESCs (below 30 passages) is recommended. ESC colonies should be routinely checked for karyotype and the expression of pluripotency markers (e.g., high Alkaline Phosphatase staining, high Nanog and Klf4 expression and low Otx2 and Fgf5 expression) (<a href="#bib6">Junyent et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib11">Martello and Smith, 2014</a>; <a href="#bib17">Ying et al., 2008</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Thaw a vial of cryopreserved ESCs:
<ol type="a">
<li>Transfer the vial from a long-term storage unit (e.g., liquid nitrogen (LN2) tank) to a polystyrene box containing dry-ice pellets.</li>
<li>In a tissue culture hood, prepare a 15 mL Falcon tube with 10 mL ESC basal media (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials &amp; equipment</a> for composition).
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> ESCs are very sensitive to DMSO present in the freezing media, which can affect their viability and cell identity if not washed off properly during thawing.</div>
</li>
<li>To quickly thaw the cells, place the bottom of the vial in a water bath set at 37°C and swirl in a circular motion to ensure even thawing.</li>
<li>Continue until only a small ice ball (∼3 mm diameter) remains in the tube (∼1 min). Transfer to a tissue culture hood.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Cell thawing should be performed rapidly and without delay to ensure maximum cell viability.</div>
</li>
<li>Pre-warm a 50 mL aliquot of ESC basal media to 37°C, in a water bath (∼10 min). Add 1 mL pre-warmed ESC basal media to the vial and transfer the contents to the prepared 15 mL Falcon tube.</li>
<li>Pellet cells by centrifugation at 1.2 <b>×</b> 10<sup>3</sup> rcf, 4 min at room temperature (RT; 18°C–23°C).</li>
<li>Aspirate supernatant, carefully avoiding the pelleted cells.</li>
<li>Resuspend pelleted cells with 1 mL ESC complete media. Ensure sufficient resuspension by repeatedly pipetting the whole volume up and down carefully to avoid bubbles.</li>
<li>Transfer the resuspended cells to an appropriate number of wells in a tissue-culture treated 6-well plate (approximately 1 <b>×</b> 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well). We use plasma-treated polystyrene plates for tissue-culture, sourced commercially (e.g., ThermoFisher, cat. num. 10578911). Coating with 0.1% Gelatin (e.g., Merk, cat. num. ES-006-B) for 1 h at RT can also be used to improve cell adherence.</li>
<li>Top up each well to a total of 2 mL ESC complete media (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials &amp; equipment</a> for composition). Ensure homogeneous distribution of cells by firmly but smoothly agitating the plate in a cross-like motion.</li>
<li>Check cell dispersion of each well using an inverted microscope with transmitted light and a low magnification objective (e.g., 4<b>×</b>, 10<b>×</b>). Cells should be small, single and homogeneously distributed throughout the well.</li>
<li>Place plates in an incubator, stabilized at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Culture ESCs for 3 days, or until the formation of mid-sized, dome-shaped colonies:
<ol type="a">
<li>Daily, check cells under a microscope to monitor cell growth.</li>
<li>After 24 h culture, and then every other day, aspirate ESC media and replenish with 2 mL pre-warmed ESC complete media.</li>
<li>Optimally, most ESC colonies will be mid-sized (50–100 μm in diameter, estimated under a calibrated microscope with a reference scale-bar), dome-shaped and with refringent edges. Flat colonies, or colonies with “spiky”/irregular edges indicate cell differentiation (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Mid-sized colonies can be used for experiments or passaged.

Under a microscope, using a 10<b>×</b> objective, unstained cells from each corner quadrant are counted, and the number of cells/quadrant is averaged. Cell density in the solution can be calculated by multiplying the averaged number by 10<sup>4</sup> and correcting by the dilution factor (e.g., multiply by 5).</li>

<h3 id="sec1.2">ESC transition to an early primed ESC stage</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4 days</div>
<p>This protocol describes the transition of ESCs to a primed ESC stage, as used in our experiments, based on the protocol published by <a href="#bib16">ten Berge et al., 2011</a>. ESCs expressing fluorescent constructs (e.g., GCaMP6s, Ftractin-mRuby3) can also be used. Notably, recent published protocols describe alternative and more stage-specific early primed ESC states that could also be used for the experiment described below (<a href="#bib9">Kinoshita et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib12">Neagu et al., 2020</a>). Additional troubleshooting may be required when using these cells.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Set up ESCs for pluripotency stage transition:
<ol type="a">
<li>Starting from a culture of ESCs (as described in steps 1–3), prepare a single cell suspension (following steps 3a-h).</li>
<li>In a 15 mL Falcon tube, mix the appropriate volumes of cell suspension (enough to reach approximately 1 <b>×</b> 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) and pre-warmed ESC basal media (e.g., 2 mL/well). Add a final 2 μM IWP2 (Milteny, cat. num. 130-105-335) to the media and mix by pipetting.</li>
<li>Transfer the mix from the previous step to an appropriate number of wells in a 6-well plate.</li>
<li>Return plate to the incubator and culture at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Change the media and assess pluripotency stage transition:
<ol type="a">
<li>Every 24 h, aspirate the media and add 2 mL/well pre-warmed ESC basal media with 2 μM IWP2.</li>
<li>Continue culturing the cells for 3 days, changing the media daily and assessing colony morphology under an inverted microscope with transmitted light. Primed ESC colonies will appear as flat colonies with “spiky” edges. In our experiments we used cells after 3 days of pluripotency transition (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Additional characterization can be performed by qPCR, immunofluorescence or alkaline phosphatase staining (AP) to verify naïve to early-primed ESC transition (e.g., upregulation of Otx2 or Fgf5, downregulation of Nanog or Klf4, reduced AP staining in primed ESCs (<a href="#bib6">Junyent et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib16">ten Berge et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib17">Ying et al., 2008</a>)</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 7 days to several weeks</div>
<p>This protocol describes the thawing, culture and passaging of TSCs. The TSCs used in our experiment were derived by the Rossant Lab (<a href="#bib15">Tanaka et al., 1998</a>), and constitutively express GFP. Using low-passage TSCs (below 30 passages) is recommended, while routinely confirming the expression of throphoblast stem cell markers (<a href="#bib15">Tanaka et al., 1998</a>). As part of the protocol, a layer of mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) will be prepared. Low-passage mitotically inactivated MEFs (passage 3) are sourced from commercial vendors (R&amp;D Systems, cat. num. PSC001). During passaging, MEFs will be separated from TSCs by selective adhesion.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Measuring cytoneme-mediated communication between ESCs or primed ESCs and TSCs</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 days</div>
<p>This protocol describes how to set up and image a co-culture of ESCs or primed ESCs (expressing Ftractin-mRuby3) and TSCs to measure their interaction, using a spinning disk confocal microscope. Variations of this protocol include the pre-treatment of TSCs with Porcupine inhibitors IWP2 (inhibitor of Wnt secretion) (<a href="#bib1">Chen et al., 2009</a>) or Wnt-C59 (Cayman Chemicals, cat. num. 16644). We exemplify the use of IWP2 below. Alternatively, Kainate (100 μM), CNQX (10 μM) or other drug treatments can be added to the media after step 3 (below) (<a href="#bib6">Junyent et al., 2020</a>). Additionally, ESCs expressing GCaMP6s or other fluorescently tagged constructs, or ESCs knock-out (KO) for Wnt/β-catenin pathway components and ionotropic glutamatergic receptors have been used in our experiments (<a href="#bib8">Junyent et al., 2021b</a>). KO ESCs can be generated following published protocols (<a href="#bib14">Ran et al., 2013</a>). In these cases, construct-expressing or KO ESCs should be used from step 2 onwards.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol describes how to analyze the reactivity of the ESC or primed ESC cytonemes to localized Wnt by either measuring the interaction between ESC cytonemes and Wnt sources or measuring the generation of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in response to Wnt contact.</p>
<p>In the first part of the protocol, the step-by-step procedure enables analysis of ESC/primed ESC cytoneme reactivity to localized sources of Wnt (Wnt3a-beads or TSCs). The experiments described will result in four dimensional images of ESCs generating cytonemes and interacting with Wnt3a-beads or TSCs. When analyzed according to the “<a href="#sec3.3">quantifying cytoneme reactivity to sources of Wnt (Wnt3a-beads or TSCs)</a>” section, ESC/primed ESC reactivity to the localized sources of Wnt can be quantified. In the majority of ESCs, initial contact of a Wnt-source by a cytoneme will be followed by Wnt recruitment (Wnt3a-beads) or cell pairing (TSCs). In these cells the “Change in distance after contact” will be negative, indicating a reduction in the distance between the cells following contact. However, when presented with inactivated Wnt3a-beads or with TSCs with inhibited Wnt secretion (IWP2-treated TSCs), most ESC cytoneme-mediated contacts should not be followed by recruitment or pairing. As a result, the “Change in distance after contact” in these conditions should remain, in average, around 0. On the other hand, primed ESCs non-selectively recruit both Wnt3a-beads and control-beads following initial cytoneme contact but fail to pair with TSCs (both control and IWP2 treated) upon initial cytoneme-mediated interaction.</p>
<p>When performing this protocol some common pitfalls should be avoided. Care should be taken to ensure maximal cell viability. For instance, the duration of trypsin incubation should be reduced to a minimum and cells should be kept in stable incubation conditions (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) whenever possible. If cell manipulation is suboptimal, dead or dying cells will be apparent in the imaging. Optimal cell concentration during imaging is also important. The number of ESCs/primed ESCs in the well should be high enough to facilitate contact with the sources of Wnt (Wnt3a-beads or TSCs), but low enough to avoid cell clumping and excessive ESC-ESC or primed ESC-primed ESC contact. Finally, careful and consistent analysis should be performed. Standardized decisions on what is considered a “Reactive” and a “Non-reactive” interaction should be established from preliminary experiments. We recommend following the criteria described in the “<a href="#sec3.3">quantifying cytoneme reactivity to sources of Wnt (Wnt3a-beads or TSCs)</a>” section, and the representative images shown in <a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a> and <a href="#fig5">5</a> or previous publications (<a href="#bib6">Junyent et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib7">2021a</a>). Decision making can be supported by measuring the change in distance between ESCs/primed ESCs and the source of Wnt, as described.</p>
<p>In the second part of the protocol, we describe the steps to prepare and image a slide of GCaMP6s-expressing ESCs or primed ESCs, and the generation of Wnt-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in their cytonemes. When performed correctly, ESCs or primed ESCs will make contact with Wnt3a-beads with outstretched cytonemes, as with the Reactivity analysis. In ESCs, localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients - ‘flashes’ of higher intensity GCaMP6s signal - should be observed initiating in the bead-contacting cytonemes. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient generation is reduced in primed ESCs contacting Wnt3a-beads, or in ESCs treated with CNQX (10 μM), lacking the Wnt/β-catenin pathway co-receptors Lrp5/6 or contacting iWnt3a-beads. Critical for this protocol is the careful and standardized distinction of localized from non-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that initiate in the cytonemes, particularly those near the contact point with the Wnt-source, are categorized as localized. While these may also emanate to the rest of the cell, they are distinguished from non-localized transients that do not arise from the Wnt-contacting cytoneme. Non-localized transients frequently occur across the entire cell simultaneously or originate from the cell soma (see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). Care should be taken to distinguish increases in signal intensity in bead-contacting cytonemes that are a result of a cell-wide transient (i.e., a non-localized transient – <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>, Cell 2) from similar increases in signal intensity that results from the bead-contacting cytoneme (i.e., localized transients – <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>, Cell 1) prior to any subsequent cell-wide transients. We recommend following the steps described in “<a href="#sec3.5">quantifying localized Ca2+ transients on ESC or primed ESC cytonemes during interaction with a Wnt source</a>”.</p>
<p>Together, this protocol enables the characterization of key functions of the ESC cytonemes, and their comparison with the cytonemes formed by primed ESCs. When combined with the use of KO ESC lines or drug treatments, this protocol will provide novel insights into the mechanisms stem cells use to contact and interact with localized sources of Wnt.</p>
<p>In addition to the protocols described here, we have performed further experiments to explore the composition and functionality of the ESC cytonemes. These include immunostaining of the cytonemes with antibodies against key molecular factors, such as cytoskeletal proteins (αTubulin, F-actin), Wnt co-receptors and Wnt/β-catenin pathway components (Lrp6, β-catenin) and ionotropic glutamatergic receptors. For these, cells are co-cultured with Wnt3a-beads as described in the protocol and fixed with paraformaldehyde. Then, standard immunofluorescence protocols are followed. Also, we have previously shown that Wnt transport through cytoneme-mediated interactions between ESCs and TSCs is an important first step to ensure correct synthetic embryogenesis. To complement the protocols described here, ESC-TSC synthetic (ETS) embryos could also be prepared, following other published protocols (<a href="#bib5">Harrison et al., 2018</a>). Briefly, to generate ETS embryos, ESCs or primed ESCs would be co-cultured with TSCs in a Matrigel culture platform, with structure formation analyzed at specific timepoints. In the accompanying publication, we saw that inhibition of Wnt production by IWP2 treatment or CNQX treatment reduces the capacity of ESCs to form synthetic embryos. Formation of ETS embryos with primed ESCs is also reduced. Although detailed elsewhere, these experiments can also prove valuable to explore cytoneme function.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>All image quantification is performed in Fiji (ImageJ), and the step-by-step pipeline of analysis is described in the protocol. Raw data processing is performed in Excel, and examples of the layout are shown in <a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a> and <a href="#fig8">8</a>. Once processed, data representation and statistical analysis is performed in Prism version 8 or later (GraphPad). Statistical comparisons should be performed with adequate statistical tests (e.g., Fisher’s exact test for qualitative data such as Percentage of “Reactive Interactions”, and T-test for continuous data such as “Change in distance after contact”).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>When investigating the cell-cell interactions in the formation of synthetic embryos, the multiplicity of a spectrum of signals received by the ESC cytoneme cannot be ruled out. This factor can be overcome through the use of the Wnt3a-beads as a recapitulation of localized Wnt3a ligands alone. Further, cellular populations of both ESCs and TSCs are heterogenous (<a href="#bib2">Frias-Aldeguer et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib17">Ying et al., 2008</a>), hence sufficient sampling of the cellular population is required. Sample-size and statistical power calculations can be performed following preliminary experiments. Expected mean and deviation values will be required. These calculations will dictate the minimal sample required. Alternatively, post-hoc power calculations can be performed to ensure that reliable statistical differences have been achieved. Of note, we analyze ≥ 30 interactions per condition, pooled at relatively equal proportions from ≥ 3 independent experiments (different cells, different imaging sessions).</p>
<p>Recently, several papers have been published that demonstrate the culture of ESCs populations between naïve and primed (<a href="#bib9">Kinoshita et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib12">Neagu et al., 2020</a>). Our protocols were established before their publication and therefore do not discuss the use of these ‘rosette’ or ‘formative’ ESC states. However, analysis of Wnt-reactivity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients may easily be adapted for the study of these pluripotency states and other cell types. In terms of cell culture conditions for ESCs and TSCs, while this protocol includes serum, it may be adapted to serum free media. Importantly, genetic KOs may affect pluripotency of ESCs, hence it is important to maintain such ESCs in 2i culture prior to synthetic embryogenesis or cytoneme reactivity analysis. The efficiency of imaging may be improved by cell-cycle synchronization of cells, however care should be taken and controls should be included to rule out interference of the synchronizing agent with cytoskeletal organization and cytoneme function. The ESC-TSC interaction protocol we have used in our experiments (<a href="#bib6">Junyent et al., 2020</a>) (<a href="#bib7">Junyent et al., 2021a</a>) takes place in 2D culture. Development of 3D culture methods may better recapitulate the <i>in vivo</i> environment at the expense of increasing biological, imaging, and analytical complexity.</p>
<p>Sufficient Wnt3a-bead activity is crucial for these measurements. Therefore, validating the purity and the activity of soluble Wnt3a and subsequently the Wnt3a-bead activity using the LSL assay are critical steps. Variation in the activity of individual Wnt3a-beads activity may exist within batches, however the activity of individual beads cannot be measured. This limitation is overcome by the sufficient sampling of multiple ESC-bead interactions to be representative of the population.</p>
<p>In terms of the confocal imaging and subsequent analysis, as with many fluorescent imaging techniques, photobleaching and phototoxicity can arise as live-cell imaging takes place, particularly over longer durations. This can be minimized using the lowest possible exposure time and illumination power to capture sufficient signal. Quantification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients requires that interactions of interest are manually screened to distinguish whole-cell transients (non-localized) from those localized to the region of bead-cytoneme interaction. Hence, these measurements are taken at the single-cell level, and currently precludes an automated, populational quantification.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Cell density is not optimal for analysis (for an example see <a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a> and <a href="#fig3">3</a>). Related to “Measuring cytoneme-mediated communication between ESCs or primed ESCs and TSCs” step 3., or “Measuring cytoneme-mediated recruitment of Wnt-beads by ESCs or primed ESCs” step 7.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Optimize cell seeding density. Aim to get single ESCs/primed ESCs close to one or two small TSC clusters, or single ESCs/primed ESCs with a few (3–5) Wnt3a-beads within reach (∼10–25 μm) of a cytoneme. This can be achieved by increasing or decreasing the concentration of ESCs/primed ESCs, TSCs or Wnt3a-beads.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Presence of dead cells or debris during imaging. Related to “<a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a>” steps 3. and 9., “Measuring cytoneme-mediated communication between ESCs or primed ESCs and TSCs” steps 1, 2. or “Measuring cytoneme-mediated recruitment of Wnt-beads by ESCs or primed ESCs” step 6.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Increased care should be taken to ensure cells are incubated with Trypsin-EDTA for a short period of time (&lt;4 min), and that cell-containing plates or slides are kept at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> whenever possible. Unstable incubation systems (e.g., temperature lower than 37°C, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations too low) will affect viability. Transport times to the microscope can also affect cell viability. We recommend using a pre-warmed polystyrene box for transport.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Low GCaMP6s or Ftractin-mRuby3 intensity or presence of construct-negative cells in the imaging. Related to “Preparation of ESC lines expressing the Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s or the F-actin reporter Ftractin-mRuby3" step 14.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To ensure homogeneous expression of fluorescent constructs (e.g., GCaMP6s, Ftractin-mRuby3), FACS can be used. A population of ESCs stably-expressing high levels of the construct can be sorted and expanded. If low-expressing cells or negative cells are detected during imaging, a second round of sorting can be performed.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>High temporal-resolution imaging required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient imaging induces photo/fluorotoxicity. Related to “Imaging Wnt-mediated Ca2+ transients in the cytonemes of ESCs or primed ESCs” step 17.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The need for high exposure times or fluorescent illumination intensity can be limited during high-temporal resolution microscopy by ensuring that the expression of GCaMP6s and Ftractin-mRuby3 is sufficiently high that low exposure times and illumination power can be used (see <a href="#sec7.5">problem 3</a>). Imaging cells of interest in series, with a confocal microscopy (i.e., non-epifluorescence illumination), ensures that cells are not exposed to high intensity light until necessary.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The activity of Wnt3a beads is low. Related to “<a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a>” step 18.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>See <a href="#bib10">Lowndes et al. 2017</a> for a comprehensive trouble shooting of this problem.</p>
