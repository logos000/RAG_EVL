<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We present a protocol for isolating hepatocytes from mice with established non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This protocol consists of liver perfusion using a peristaltic pump, followed by a modified 25% and 90% Percoll gradient centrifugation protocol to capture lipid-laden hepatocytes that are usually lost using traditional isolation protocols. This protocol enables simultaneous isolation of normal and lipid-filled hepatocytes. Lipid-filled hepatocytes can be used in cell culture systems to study drug metabolism, hepatotoxicity, or glucose and lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib9">Sharabi et al. (2017)</a> and <a href="#bib4">Kegel et al. (2016)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol will isolate viable hepatocytes from healthy murine livers, as well as from mice with established non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This protocol has been modified based on previous work to enable isolation of lipid-filled hepatocytes (<a href="#bib1">Berry and Friend, 1969</a>; <a href="#bib5">Kreamer et al., 1986</a>; <a href="#bib7">Pertoft, 2000</a>; <a href="#bib3">Gonçalves et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#bib6">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib4">Kegel et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib9">Sharabi et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This protocol can be used to isolate hepatocytes from mice with different genetic backgrounds and mutations to facilitate the investigation of gene function in liver disease.</div>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–10 weeks</div>
<ol>
<li>All animal procedures need to be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All experiments in this protocol were approved by the Stanford Animal Care and Use Committee protocol #32982.</li>
<li>House 6–8 week old male or female C57BL/6 mice in a cage of 4–5 mice per cage in a temperature-controlled (20°C–22°C) room on a 12-h light/dark cycle.</li>
<li>Feed mice with either a chow diet or with a diet to induce non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, hereafter referred to as NASH diet (Research Diets). The NASH diet consists of 40% kcal fat (palm oil), 20% kcal fructose, and 2% cholesterol and has previously been shown to induce clinical, biochemical, and histological features of fatty liver disease in animals (<a href="#bib8">Radhakrishnan et al., 2020</a>).</li>
<li>Hepatic lipid accumulation can be seen at the cellular level after a week of feeding, while whole-body changes such as body weight and blood glucose are typically seen starting at 6 weeks on this diet. Measure body weights and non-fasted glucose levels using a glucometer weekly. At 6 weeks and beyond, NASH diet-fed mice are expected to demonstrate significantly higher body weights, higher blood glucose levels, and enlarged and pale livers (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) compared to chow-fed mice.

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The exact time for optimal liver digestion will vary slightly between mice. Signs of underdigestion include inability to mechanically dissociate the liver into a single-cell suspension. Signs of overdigestion include complete digestion of the liver into a homogenous solution before transfer to the petri dish. Digestion is considered successful when the liver can readily be transferred to the petri dish, and the cell solution is homogenous without visible liver pieces after mechanical dissociation and can easily be passed through the 70 μm strainer.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.3">Single-cell hepatocyte isolation using Percoll gradient centrifugation</h3>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4–6 h</div>
<p>This step will separate viable hepatocytes with different sizes of lipids from dead hepatocytes and other non-parenchymal cell types in the cell suspension using Percoll gradient centrifugation. The Percoll media is composed of colloidal silica and has been extensively used for the isolation of cells and organelles (<a href="#bib5">Kreamer et al., 1986</a>; <a href="#bib7">Pertoft, 2000</a>). The density of the Percoll solution is dependent on its concentration, the total g-force, and the centrifugation time, which will affect the gradient formation. Depending on the requirements, conditions such as centrifugal force, centrifugation time, and Percoll density gradient composition can be modified.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Centrifuge the strained cells at 50 × <i>g</i> for 5 min at 20°C–24°C to separate hepatocytes from non-parenchymal cells. Hepatocytes will pellet at 50 × <i>g.</i>
</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The estimated yield is ∼ 1–2 million hepatocytes from one liver isolated from 6–9 weeks diet-induced NASH with a viability ranging from 50%–90% (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A). This can be compared to the yield from one mouse liver isolated from chow-fed mice which is ∼ 5–20 million cells. Typically, shorter time on NASH diet will result in a higher cell number and viability. Furthermore, with less severe liver steatosis, a higher number of hepatocytes will be obtained from the 90% Percoll gradient, while more severe steatosis will result in a larger fraction of hepatocytes isolated from the 25% Percoll gradient.</p>

<p>A frequently observed outcome from a hepatocyte isolation from different Percoll fractions is shown in the graph expressed as viable/dead cells from each Percoll fraction (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B). Accordingly, measuring the lipid content by oil red O staining shows increased lipid staining in the 25% Percoll gradient compared to 90%, demonstrating successful isolation of lipid-deficient and lipid-filled hepatocytes (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>C).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>One distinct disadvantage of this method is the yield of viable lipid-filled hepatocytes that can be obtained in comparison to a typical hepatocyte isolation from healthy livers. Thus, the degree of NASH-induction might have to be optimized to achieve the highest yield while inducing a sufficient degree of steatosis. Additionally, cells from NASH mice are more sensitive to overdigestion. Therefore, careful observation of the timing of digestion is essential, as this otherwise can result in large variability between preparations.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of culturing primary hepatocytes is the short time frame by which experiments have to be concluded (<a href="#bib10">Shulman and Nahmias, 2013</a>). Typically, primary hepatocytes will lose their functional features within 24–48 h after plating, leading to a dramatic drop in typical hepatocyte genes such as <i>albumin</i>, while fibroblast markers such as <i>afp</i> are increased, indicating a loss of cell characteristics. This limits the number and types of downstream functional assays that can be performed. However, multiple types of analyses can be performed within this time frame which might have useful applications, such as drug metabolism assays, hepatotoxicity assays, or glucose and lipid metabolic assays. Alternatively, for long-term functional analyses, our isolation method could be used in conjunction with the 5C small molecule inhibitor cocktail for the preservation of hepatocyte-specific functions and differentiation (<a href="#bib11">Xiang et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Failure to cannulate inferior vena cava (step 11).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the catheter insertion into inferior vena cava is unsuccessful, the catheter can be inserted into the hepatic portal vein. Proceed with the perfusion according to the protocol, but instead cut the inferior vena cava to release excess blood.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Low cell viability or small cell pellets (step 27).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Low cell viability or small cell pellets can be due to either incomplete digestion or overdigestion.</p>
<p>Poor perfusion can result in incomplete digestion and low recovery of cells. This will lead to the inability to mechanically dissociate the liver into a single-cell suspension. To solve this problem, ensure that the perfusion using perfusion buffer results in a pale, slightly swollen liver before introducing the digestion buffer. Excessive perfusion and digestion will lead to overdigestion and should be avoided to prevent cell death. If overdigestion is seen, lower the speed of perfusion and digestion from 2 mL/min to 1 mL/min.</p>
<p>The time of digestion will depend on the specific collagenase activity in the digestion buffer. Due to lot-to-lot variability in collagenase activity, optimization is warranted when using a new lot.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Low cell recovery during Percoll gradient cell isolation even after successful perfusion (step 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This problem might occur when the temperature of the Percoll solution is incorrect or when too many cells are added to the gradient. Keep the Percoll medium at 20°C–24°C to maintain accurate density and to keep the pH between 8.5–9.5. The volume of the density gradient is optimized for one murine liver per gradient. If more cells are needed, several livers can be pooled together. If pooling livers from several mice, increase the volume of media and gradient media accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="q-and-a">Q&amp;A</h2>
<p class="questions"><b>Q:</b> I have isolated mouse hepatocytes and am trying to extract RNA from non-cultured and cultured samples. My results are not very clean. The RNA samples look degraded. All RIN numbers are very low, and I am not sure why samples are degraded. What could be happening to my RNA? Could I have bad collagenase? What effect would that have on my cell? My cultures were fine and I had cells; I then snap froze the cells and extracted RNA with a Qiagen kit. I am looking at all possible angles to address the problem and any help is appreciated!</p>
<p class="answer"><b>A:</b> Based on the information given, several possible reasons could explain these results. Including appropriate controls at each step will help determine which step needs additional optimization.</p>
<ol>
<li>RNA isolation issues: To rule out the possibility of unsuccessful RNA isolation, use another cell line as a control and test if you can successfully isolate RNA from the control cell line but not the isolated hepatocytes. Ensure that the samples are properly preserved after cell isolation and before RNA isolation. Process to RNA isolation immediately or freeze samples immediately at -80C for future RNA isolation.</li>
<li>Cell viability issues: If the RNA isolation is successful for the cell line but not from the isolated hepatocytes, the cell viability might be too low. Upon cell isolation, measure cell viability of the isolated hepatocytes before plating to make sure viability is 60-95%. The RNA yield depends on the total cell number. To increase the isolated cell number: 1) Increase perfusion efficiency: perfuse until the whole liver (every lobe) changes color (Fig 3B) before switching to digestion. 2) Increase the number of plated cells: for cultured cells, make sure to plate the cells according to viable cell number instead of total cell number at Step 28.</li>
