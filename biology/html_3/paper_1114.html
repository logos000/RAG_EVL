<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol describes how to obtain human astrocytes from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in chemically defined media, without the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS). FBS eases the differentiation of astrocytes but also deeply alters their phenotype, as compared with their <i>in vivo</i> counterparts. Our protocol generates hiPSC-derived astrocytes displaying a phenotype and functions similar to human primary astrocytes, including adequate response to inflammation, neurotransmitter uptake, and trophic support to neurons.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00608-0/sref4">Perriot et al. (2018)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The execution of this protocol requires knowledge of pluripotent stem cell culture techniques, which are not covered here. Human iPSCs used to develop this protocol have been cultured in StemMACS human iPSC Brew medium (Miltenyi) or TeSR-E8 medium (Stemcell Technologies). We do not foresee any limitation using other culture media for hiPSC culture but did not assess it experimentally. Human iPSCs and differentiated cells were cultured in a humidified 37°C incubator and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>For optimal results, the protocol should be initiated using hiPSCs at 70%–80% confluence without any differentiated cells. The protocol was successfully carried out using hiPSCs from passage 10 to 40.</p>
<p>Prior to beginning the differentiation protocol, prepare media, solutions, and matrix-coated culture dishes. Once prepared, media supplemented with N-2 and B-27 supplements can be kept at 4°C for 2 weeks. However, other supplements (growth factors and others) should be added freshly to the medium every time of use. All media should be brought to room temperature (20°C–24°C) or 37°C prior to adding on the cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Poly-L-ornithine coating</h3>
<ol>
<li>Dilute poly-L-ornithine at 1:5 in sterile water and add it to the dish in order to cover the entire surface. Incubate at room temperature for 2 h.</li>
<li>Remove poly-L-ornithine solution and add laminin (2 μg/mL diluted in sterile water) in order to cover the entire surface. Incubate at room temperature for 2 h. Coated dishes can be kept in this solution for 2 days at 4°C before use.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Matrigel coating</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>Thaw matrigel at 4°C.</li>
<li>Dilute matrigel in cold DMEM/F12 as per dilution factor mentioned on the datasheet (final concentration of 100 μg/mL).</li>
<li>Add the diluted matrigel to the dish in order to cover the entire surface.</li>
<li>Incubate at room temperature for 60 min. Coated dishes can be kept as such at 37°C for 3 days (no wash needed before use).</li>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Differentiation of human iPSCs into neural precursor cells</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4–5 weeks</div>
<p>This section provides the detailed steps for obtaining neural precursor cells (NPCs) from hiPSCs. The first stage is based on the well established dual inhibition of SMAD signaling (<a href="#bib3">Chambers et al., 2009</a>), using SB431542 together with Noggin for concomitant inhibition of TGFβ and BMP signaling. Other BMP inhibitors such as LDN193189 or dorsomorphin can be used instead of noggin. The second stage describes the amplification of NPCs leveraging FGF2 and EGF signaling (<a href="#bib1">Boissart et al., 2013</a>).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Ensure of the hiPSC quality before starting the protocol. Human iPSCs should be at 70%–80% confluence and colonies to present an homogeneous aspect without differentiated cells.</div>
<ol>
<li>On day 0, remove culture medium and add 1 mL of neural base medium to remove debris and cells in suspension from the dish.</li>
<li>Remove medium and add 1 mL of Neural induction medium + Rock inhibitor Y27632 (10μM).</li>
<li>With a cell scraper, draw successive vertical lines in the 35 mm dish to cut iPSC colonies as shown below. Then rotate the dish by 90° and redraw the same pattern to obtain squares. Rotate the dish once more by 45° and redraw the same pattern. See <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Schematic to generate hiPSC clumps for spheroid formation</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Use the cell scraper to lift the clumps of iPSCs by gently scraping the bottom of the dish.</li>
<li>Gently transfer the entire clump suspension into a well of low-binding 6-well plate and add 1 mL of Neural induction medium + Rock inhibitor Y27632 (10μM). Incubate at 37°C for 4–6hrs until the clumps have formed spheroids.</li>
<li>Transfer the entire spheroid suspension to a new 35 mm dishes coated with poly-L-ornithine/Laminin (PO/L). Add 8μL/mL of Laminin to the medium for spheroid attachment. Incubate at 37°C. The next day, most of the spheroids should have adhered to the plate. <a href="#sec6.1">Troubleshooting 1</a>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> We found this way of forming spheroids to give the best results in term of purity of NPCs obtained. However, because it may be technically cumbersome to perform this technique without training, alternative methods can be used at this step: either spheroid formation using Aggrewell plates (STEMCELL Technologies), or induction after single cell hiPSC passaging such as described by Chambers et al.</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Change medium every other day. Check cell morphology every time for rosette appearance (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A).

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 2. Overview of the protocol generating hiPSC-derived NPCs</div>
<p>This timeline recapitulates the main steps to generate NPCs from hiPSCs with representative pictures of the expected cellular morphology at each intermediate: rosette appearance (A and B), clumps one day after rosette harvesting (C and D), NPCs 2 days after splitting (E) and NPCs at 100% confluent before splitting (F). Pictures (G and H) show an NPC population with low purity as assessed by the number of cells negative for PAX6 (G) and SOX2 (H). Conversely, pictures (I and J) show highly enriched NPCs with almost all cells expressing PAX6 (I) and SOX2 (J). The protocol can be paused and cells frozen for further use at P9 after NPC amplification. In the timeline, lozenges represent when an enzymatic passage should be performed (see step 13 for the procedure). Scale bar: 200 μm.</p>

</li>
<li>On day 10, remove neural induction medium and add 2 mL of NPC expansion medium.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Rosettes should be numerous by Day 10, either as monolayers or as multiple layers (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B).</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>On day 13, change medium as of Day 10. Select areas with high density of rosettes, cut them in squares with a needle, and lift them individually with a 200 μL micropipette. <a href="#sec6.3">Troubleshooting 2</a>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> We recommend replating lifted rosettes on the same surface as previously cultured. Overall and after all the amplification steps, one 35mm dish of rosettes generates hundreds of millions of NPCs at the cell banking stage, pause point after step 15.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The method described above generates a population of NPCs with the highest degree of purity (&gt;95%). However, this method is time consuming and requires having a microscope under the laminar flow for optimal performance. Alternatively, rosettes can be harvested using the STEMdiff™ Neural Rosette Selection Reagent (STEMCELL Technologies). Please refer to manufacturer’s instructions: <a href="https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/29031-PIS_1_1_3.pdf?_ga=2.73202899.175041898.1632491430-1765224757.1631649414">link</a>. Keep in mind that the efficacy of this reagent is hiPSC line dependent. A third possibility, in case of very high homogeneity in the culture dish, is to perform an enzymatic passage to harvest all cells at once and then to purify them as described in the <a href="#sec6.3">troubleshooting 2</a> section.</div>
<ol start="10">
<li>Transfer the clumps from the 35 mm dish to a new PO/L-coated 35 mm dish. From then, the cells are called NPCs and are at passage 1. Add Rock inhibitor Y27632 (10μM) to the medium (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>C and 2D).</li>
<li>On day 14, change NPC expansion medium and incubate the cells at 37°C.</li>
<li>Change medium every other day and passage them after 6–7 days or at 80%–100% confluence if earlier. At this stage, we expect a yield of about 70′000 to 100′000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> so one 35 mm dish should yield enough cells for one to two T25 flasks.</li>
<li>Split the cells using TrypLE:
<ol type="a">
<li>Remove the culture medium and add 1 mL of TrypLE express per 35 mm dish (add 5 mL for a T75 flask). Incubate the cells at 37°C minutes for 10 min.</li>
<li>Harvest the cells in flacon tubes and add twice the volume of DMEM/F-12. Centrifuge 5 min at 300 <i>g</i>.</li>
<li>Resuspend the cell pellet in culture medium and count the cells.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Seed the cells in NPC expansion medium on matrigel-coated flasks (scale up flask size as needed) at 50′000 cells/cm2. Incubate at 37°C. NPCs are now at P2. <a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>E and 2F show representative pictures of NPC morphology during amplification.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Cellular identity of NPCs can be assessed from this point: &gt;80% of cells obtained should express PAX6 and SOX2 (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>G–2J).</div>
<ol start="15">
<li>Change medium every other day. Split NPCs when confluent. Cell growth should allow splitting every 3–4 days. Each splitting increases the passage number by 1.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Cells can be amplified for a total of 8 passages and banked at P9 at 5 million cells per vial.</div>
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause point:</span> Pausing at this step allows generating important batches of NPCs with high survival after thawing (&gt;70%) to directly start astrocyte differentiation from this step (<a href="#sec6.5">troubleshooting 3</a>).

<h3 id="sec3.2">Differentiation of hiPSC-derived NPCs into astrocytes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 6 weeks</div>
<p>This section describes the steps to differentiate previously obtained NPCs into astrocytes. It relies on activation of the JAK/STAT pathway by concomitant exposure of NPCs to EGF and LIF in order to accelerate the glial switch (<a href="#bib2">Bonni et al., 1997</a>) in absence of serum. LIF is instrumental to activate the JAK/STAT pathway while EGF inhibits premature differentiation of NPCs into neurons. Maturation of astrocytes is obtained by exposure to CNTF. This step can be performed after freezing/thawing of NPCs but has to be conducted to the end without pause once started. Thus, counting of days of differentiation restart at 0.</p>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> In case a pause has been made between steps 15 and 16, cells need to be thawed to perform astrocyte differentiation. See additional procedures at the end of the protocol for cell thawing.</div>
<ol start="16">
<li>At D0 of astrocyte differentiation, change NPC culture medium to Astrocyte induction medium (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, left panel).

<p>This timeline recapitulates the main steps to generate astrocytes from hiPSC-derived NPCs with representative pictures of the expected cellular morphology at each intermediate: thawed NPCs, differentiating cells and mature astrocytes. Cells can be banked at the end of the protocol after astrocyte maturation. On the central panel, white arrows indicate NPC niches, blue arrows indicate differentiating neurons and green arrows indicate emerging astrocytes. In the timeline, lozenges approximately represent the frequency of enzymatic passages (see steps 13 to 15 for the procedure). Scale bar: 200 μm.</p>

</li>
<li>Change medium every other day for 14 days. Slit cells with TrypLE as described on Step 13 each time they reach confluence during this step (about every 3–4 days).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This step serves to trigger the glial switch in NPCs. It thus decreases the potential of NPCs to generate neurons and changes the epigenetic landscape of the cells to allow astrocyte generation. There is no need for massive amplification of the cells at this stage as the cells retain a certain proliferation potential until D21.</div>
<ol start="18">
<li>At D14, switch medium to Astrocyte medium + CNTF (20 ng/mL). Cells start to differentiate, and neurons and astrocytes can be seen in the culture (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, central panel).</li>
<li>From D14 to D28, change medium every other day and passage cells when at confluence (do not passage them if confluence is &lt;90%–100%, however cells can be allowed to overgrow). Seed cells at 40′000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> onto matrigel-coated flasks and incubate at 37°C. Refer to <a href="#sec6.5">troubleshooting 3</a> for evaluating how many flasks are needed depending on the expected yield of astrocytes.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Proliferation will decrease as NPCs differentiate. The extent of this decrease is dependent upon each iPSC line. Neurons may appear in the culture concomitantly to astrocytes. Overall, neurons will die at each splitting to let only astrocytes in culture at the end of the protocol. Between D14 and D21, cells should mostly have an NPC morphology with some neurons. Between D21 and D28, a mix of NPCs, neurons and immature astrocytes should be present in the culture.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The protocol described here allows obtaining highly enriched culture composed of more than 95% of human astrocytes (<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>) as displayed in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>. The total yield of astrocytes generated depends only on the amplification strategy decided by the operator (<a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>). One single operator can handle the generation of more than 100 million astrocytes per differentiation providing that the surface of cell culture is regularly increased to match the number of cells generated. See <a href="#sec6.5">troubleshooting 3</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Astrocytes were derived from seven donors according to the present protocol. Two hiPSC lines were derived for four donors and one hiPSC line for three donors. Astrocytes express canonical astrocytic markers as monitored by immunofluorescence staining for EAAT1 (red), S100β (blue) and GFAP (green) (A). More than 95% of the cells in culture co-express both EAAT1 and S100β while GFAP is expressed by a variable proportion of the cells (B). As compared to parental NPCs, astrocytes display increased expression of typical astrocyte markers associated with a downregulation of NPCs and neuronal markers (C). Scale bar: 100 μm.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The protocol detailed here reproducibly generates a highly enriched population of functional astrocytes without the use of serum. This method presents several advantages such as the generation of astrocytes with a resting and less altered phenotype as compared to astrocytes cultured in serum, yet removing serum from culture medium renders more difficult the glial switch in NPCs. As a result, the final yield and timing of astrocytes may vary depending on the hiPSC line used. First, some hiPSC lines generate NPCs demonstrating resistance to acquire gliogenic potential. As a consequence, the optimal duration of priming with EGF and LIF should be empirically determined (elongated) if the timing described here fails to generate high yields of astrocytes. Second, mature astrocytes are big cells and the number of cells generated per cm<sup>2</sup> is often low as compared to other cell types. This characteristic renders cumbersome the generation of important batches of cells and requires to perform cell culture on a large surface (&gt;1000cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Low adherence of spheroids</p>
<p>The day after plating at step 6, most spheroids should have adhered to the dish. In some occasion, many spheroids may remain in suspension.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Harvest the spheroids in a 15-mL falcon tube. Let the clumps to sediment at the bottom of the tube. Carefully remove the supernatant in the tube and add 2 mL of Neural induction medium with Laminin at 8 μg/mL. Replate the clumps in a new PO/L-coated 35 mm dish. Then continue the protocol from step 7.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Presence of non-astrocytic cells</p>
<p>At the end of the protocol, more than 95% off cells should be astrocytes (double positive for EAAT1 and S100β together with the corresponding morphology). If it is not the case, it is most likely due to contaminant cells at the NPCs stage, i.e., some cells composing the population generated at step 9 are not NPCs.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We recommend to attentively follow the instructions at step 9 and to take the maximal care of harvesting only neural rosettes as cells outside of these rosettes may be of other lineages than NPCs (neural crest cells for example). The population resulting from rosette selection should be negative for CD271 (&lt;10%) and positive for CD56 (&gt;90%). If the rosettes are not clearly identifiable, it is mostly due to the generation of hiPSC clumps that would be too small at step 4. An alternative solution to enrich the culture in NPCs, in case selection of rosettes alone would not be possible, is to purify the cells based on surface marker expression. We suggest using flow cytometry or magnetic-activated sorting based on PSA-NCAM marker right after step 9.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Low NPC survival after thawing</p>
<p>After thawing, survival of NPCs should reach around 70%. In rare occasions, survival may be lower and prevent correct execution of the differentiation (step 16).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Poor survival arises from two different factors: poor execution of the freezing/thawing procedure or poor cell quality at freezing.</p>
<p>One key aspect of optimal freezing and thawing is a rapid execution. Cells should remain in liquid freezing medium the least time possible, both before freezing and after thawing. We recommend to have all reagents, media and falcon tubes ready when starting the procedures. Transfer to the −80°C freezer should be done without waiting once cells are resuspended in the freezing medium during freezing. Use of containers (MrFrosty<sup>TM</sup>) allowing a progressive decrease of temperature greatly increases cell survival. For thawing, the freezing medium should be diluted at least 10 times as soon as possible after thawing of the vial.</p>
<p>Poor cell quality at freezing is independent on the freezing procedure and should be avoided at all cost as such cells will not be usable for further differentiation and the protocol should be restarted from the beginning. It may happen if cells are over confluent on the day of freezing thus we recommend performing cell banking at 80%–90% of confluence to ensure that the cells are as healthy as possible.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Low yield of astrocytes</p>
<p>Conducted correctly, the protocol can yield more than 100 million cells. Lower yields can be intentional by reducing the surface of culture. Indeed, generating that many cells is costly in terms of hands-on time and reagents. Yet unwanted low yield may happen for two main reasons: low gliogenic potential of NPCs after step 17 or poor amplification strategy.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>In case of low gliogenic potential, NPCs will mostly differentiate into neurons, which can be observed already by D21. The switch from neurogenic potential to gliogenic potential is variable depending on each hiPSC line. The timing proposed here should work for most lines but could be too short for some. In case of too abundant neuronal differentiation, we recommend to extend the culture with the Astrocyte Induction medium by one to two weeks. Glial switch can be monitored by assessing the expression of transcription factors such as NeuroD2 and NeuroG2 (downregulation in gliogenic NPCs) and SOX9 and NFIA (upregulation in gliogenic NPCs).</p>
<p>In case of low yield due to a poor amplification strategy, the operator should keep in mind that astrocytes should be plated at low density as they become mature thus requiring an important cell culture surface. About 30′000 to 40′000 cells can be obtain per cm<sup>2</sup>. As cells proliferate less with maturation, the operator should anticipate this effect and perform immature astrocyte amplification between D14 and D28. A total culture surface of around 2000–2500cm<sup>2</sup> at D35 should allow generating about 100 million astrocytes if NPCs have developed a good gliogenic potential between D0 and D14 (see point above). See <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a> below for seeding density at each stage and suggested cell culture surface.</p>

<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Low astrocyte survival after thawing</p>
<p>After thawing, survival of astrocytes should reach 50%–70% of frozen cells. Lower cell survival results from non-optimal cell handling and freezing (step 21).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="#sec6.5">troubleshooting 3</a>, freezing and thawing procedures must be executed quickly. Please refer to <a href="#sec6.5">troubleshooting 3</a> for the aspects of the method. In addition, cellular density at freezing impacts on cell survival at thawing. We recommend freezing astrocytes at 3–5 million cells/mL. Lower density will result in low cell survival. Higher density (tested up to 7 million/mL) does not result in higher survival.</p>
