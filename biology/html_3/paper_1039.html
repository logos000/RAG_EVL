<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Oxidized phosphatidylcholine (OxPC) found in multiple sclerosis brain lesions mediates neurodegeneration. Microglia are prominent responders to the OxPC insult, and thus, studying their protective or noxious functions is important to help halt neurodegeneration. Here, we present protocols including cell isolation and culture, animal surgeries, as well as tissue processing and isolation to study the microglia response to OxPC-mediated neurodegeneration <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00559-1/sref1">Dong et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec2.1">Isolate and culture primary mouse cortical neurons</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4<b>–</b><b>6 days</b>
</div>
<p>Primary neurons are isolated from brains of embryonic C57BL/6 mice and grown in preparation for co-culturing with microglia. Here, we propose to isolate and grow neurons from embryos as it is difficult to isolate viable neurons from adult mice for large scale experiments. On average each pregnant C57BL/6 mouse carries 6 embryos, if additional cells are needed; CD-1 mice may be considered as they have a higher average litter size of 10.</p>
<ol>
<li>Coat T25 tissue culture flasks with 5 mL of 10 μg/mL poly-L-ornithine (PO) dissolved in sterile distilled water for at least 30 min (preferably more than 8 h) at 22°C–24°C. Remove the PO solution and wash with sterile distilled water.
<ol type="a">
<li>For downstream assay, coat 96-well flat bottom black/clear plates (Falcon 353219) with PO solution. This may also be used for immediate culturing of neurons.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Prepare the following:
<ol type="a">
<li>Prepare and prewarm the growth medium containing Neurobasal Plus medium (Gibco) and 1X B27 Plus Supplement (Gibco) at 37°C.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Prepare this fresh before use.</div>
</li>
<li>On a hot plate, prewarm ∼ 300 mL of water in a 1 L beaker to 35°C–38°C.</li>
<li>Disinfect instruments with 70% ethanol: dissection scissors, forceps, iridectomy scissors, ultra-fine point forceps, and scalpel.</li>
<li>Autoclaved 100 mL bottles and Buchner funnel with nylon mesh at 130 μm pore size.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Acquire cortical neurons from mouse embryos at gestation days 14–16.
<ol type="a">
<li>Euthanize pregnant mouse with ketamine (100 mg/mg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) overdose via intraperitoneal injection.</li>
<li>Lay the anesthetized mouse on its back; disinfect the abdominal area with 70% ethanol. Lift the skin of the lower abdomen and make a V-shaped incision with scissors.</li>
<li>Disinfect the instruments with 70% ethanol once more. Then lift the uterine horns containing the embryos, dissect them out of the abdominal cavity, and place them in a sterile 10-cm petri dish containing calcium and magnesium-free Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (CMF-HBSS).</li>
<li>In a biosafety cabinet, dissect the uterine horns to release the embryos from their individual sacs.</li>
<li>Use iridectomy scissors to cut around the base of the head of each embryo, such that the skin can be lifted to reveal the brain. Carefully scoop out the brain into a new sterile 10-cm petri dish containing 20 mL CMF-HBSS.</li>
<li>Remove the meninges from the brains using a dissection microscope, separate the cerebral hemispheres and place them in a new sterile 10-cm petri dish containing 3–5 mL of CMF-HBSS.</li>
<li>Dice the cerebral hemispheres with a sterile scalpel into fragments of &lt; 1 mm and form a tissue suspension by adding 10–15 mL of CMF-HBSS. Drop a stir-bar into an autoclaved 100 mL bottle, then transfer the tissue suspension into the bottle with a sterile pipette. Note the volume transferred.</li>
<li>Add sterile trypsin to the tissue suspension to a final concentration of 0.025% (from 2.5% stock solution, Gibco). Immerse the 100 mL bottle containing the tissue suspension in the prewarmed water bath at 35°C–38°C, set the stirring speed to low medium, and homogenize the tissue for 15 min at 35°C–38°C.</li>
<li>Add 1 mL of sterile heat inactivated FBS to the homogenized suspension to inactivate the trypsin, then pour the suspension through the Buchner filter funnel with nylon mesh into a new autoclaved 100 mL bottle. Using the plunger of a 3 mL syringe, gently grind the tissue on the nylon mesh and wash it through the filter with CMF-HBSS.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Alternatively, a sterile 100 μm cell strainer may be used to filter cells.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>OxPCs were previously described as end-product reporter for oxidative damage and free radical formation in MS lesions (<a href="#bib3">Haider et al., 2011</a>). We recently demonstrated that OxPCs found in MS lesions are mediators of neurodegeneration and that microglia deficiency exacerbates OxPC induced neurodegeneration (<a href="#bib1">Dong et al., 2021</a>). Here, we present protocols for <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> approaches to study microglia functions in response to OxPC mediated neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>For primary neuron isolation from the brain cortices of mouse embryos, expected yield per brain is approximately 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells. Healthy neurons isolated from the brain cortices of mouse embryos will express tubulin β3 and grow interconnected processes after 2–3 days (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). In culture in 96-well plates, these neurons may be used as a high throughput assay to study neurodegeneration and neuroprotection by various compounds and molecules (<a href="#bib1">Dong et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib2">Faissner et al., 2017</a>). For microglia isolation from the brains of adult mice, expected yield per brain is approximately 0.5 to 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells. Microglia isolated from the adult mouse brain are CD68<sup>+</sup> and Tmem119<sup>+</sup> for at least 48 h in culture (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>), and the addition of these cells in coculture with neurons makes this a useful model to assess how microglia may interact with neurons. In addition, the described method of adult microglia isolation has been tested with 6-week-old and 52-week-old mice, potentially allowing for comparisons on the effect of aging on microglia ex vivo and <i>in vitro</i>. Without perturbations, neurons cocultured with microglia at roughly 4:1 ratio (1 × 10<sup>5</sup> neurons to 2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> microglia per well in a 96 well plate) remains healthy (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>), potentially up to 3 weeks (data not shown). More importantly, brain derived microglia prevented the loss of tubulin β3<sup>+</sup> neurons after 24 h of OxPC treatment (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>) while also inhibiting OxPC mediated upregulation of cleaved caspase 3 (<a href="#bib1">Dong et al., 2021</a>). Overall, this approach is a useful <i>in vitro</i> platform for screening molecules that may interfere or enhance the neuroprotective functions of microglia.</p>

<p>Injection of purified OxPCs (POVPC or PAzePC) into the ventral spinal cord white matter of mice induces a demyelinating lesion with IBA1<sup>+</sup> microglia/macrophage recruitment and accumulation, E06<sup>+</sup> OxPC deposition (progressively increase from day 1 to day 7 after injection), early depletion of oligodendrocytes (1 day after injection) followed by OLIG2<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocyte progenitor cell recruitment (7 days after injection), and loss of neurofilament heavy chain (NFH)<sup>+</sup> axons (<a href="#bib1">Dong et al., 2021</a>). Microglia depletion by DT injection in CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>:Rosa26<sup>iDTR</sup> mice led to a larger lesion with increased E06<sup>+</sup> OxPC deposition as well as reduced microglia, OLIG2<sup>+</sup> cells, and NFH<sup>+</sup> axons compared to PBS injected CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>:Rosa26<sup>iDTR</sup> mice (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>) (<a href="#bib1">Dong et al., 2021</a>). While we tested microglia depletion for the first 7 days and between days 7 and 14 following OxPC injection, additional time points of microglia depletion will be of interest for future investigations. In addition, microglia depletion in CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>:Rosa26<sup>iDTR</sup> mice of different age will help describe how aging impacts microglia functions. Thus, this approach allows for the temporal study of microglia in response to OxPC mediated neurodegeneration in the spinal cord white matter of mice.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Neurons</h3>
<p>The <i>in vitro</i> neuron microglia coculture model uses neurons derived from the brain cortices of embryos between embryonic gestation days 14 and 16. These neurons likely do not represent adult neurons found in the brain and spinal cord. However, adult brain-derived neurons have not survived the isolation process in our experience. Thus, potential interactions between mismatched adult derived microglia and embryo derived neurons <i>in vitro</i> will require careful testing <i>in vivo</i>.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Microglia isolation and purity</h3>
<p>The yield of microglia isolated using this protocol is limited per mouse brain. Thus, pooling multiple brains for microglia isolation is recommended. Additionally, the commercial kit used for microglia enrichment uses CD11b<sup>+</sup> antibody positive selection and thus present two potential limitations: 1) non-microglial myeloid cells such as monocytes or border associated macrophages may be included from processing the whole brain and 2) CD11b antibody remaining on isolated cells may lead to abnormal cellular response/activation.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">OxPC spinal cord injection</h3>
<p>While using non-oxidized DPPC is recommended as a negative control for <i>in vitro</i> cell culture experiments, DPPC cannot be injected into the spinal cords of mice as it does not dissolve in aqueous solutions. Given DPPC does not harm neurons <i>in vitro</i> and PC species are found in high abundance in myelin and as components of cell membranes, we do not expect DPPC to induce neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, the effect of excess PC in the spinal cord white matter has not been tested and remains unclear. Moreover, the acute demyelination and neurodegeneration induced by this method are relatively severe and thus it may be difficult to achieve protective effects when testing potential therapeutics. Thus, varying the amount of OxPC injected into the spinal cord may be required.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Microglia depletion</h3>
<p>The CX3CR1 promoter is also active in meningeal macrophages, choroid plexus macrophages, and perivascular macrophages of the central nervous system (<a href="#bib4">Masuda et al., 2020</a>). Using CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>:Rosa26<sup>iDTR</sup> mice will likely deplete microglia in addition to these border-associated macrophages. Thus, future studies should also consider delineating potential functional differences between microglia and border associated macrophages. Microglia depletion in this protocol is throughout the central nervous system and not restricted to the spinal cord lesion, thus how tissue wide microglia deficiency affect tissue homeostasis and whether this impact the OxPC lesion needs additional investigation.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Poor neuron survival and health (step 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Thoroughly wash to remove the polyornithine from tissue culture flasks or 96-well plates. Make sure the water bath temperature does not exceed 38°C when dissociating the cells. Avoid vortexing and harsh pipetting when dispersing cell pellets into a single cell suspension. Check that the neuron growth medium has not expired. Only exchange half the cell culture medium at any time and do not expose neurons to air. Check that the cell culture incubator has the correct settings.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>High amounts of debris found in cells isolated from the adult mouse brain (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure centrifuge break settings are in accordance with the protocol. Take extra care when pipetting to remove the myelin layer and the supernatant layer after Percoll centrifugation steps.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Purified OxPCs do not consistently cause neuron damage (step 11).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Purified OxPCs such as POVPC and PAzePC are supplied as lyophilized powders from the manufacturer and at time may be difficult to see in the glass vials. Carefully wash the bottom and all sides of the glass vial to ensure full resuspension of OxPCs into solution. OxPCs will hydrolyze and degrade in aqueous solution. Thus for <i>in vitro</i> experiments resuspend OxPCs in 100% ethanol and dilute with neuron growth medium just prior to experiment. For <i>in vivo</i> experiments, resuspend OxPCs in PBS just prior to spinal cord injections. Minimize the amount of time that OxPCs are resuspended in buffers.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Spinal cord injection did not produce lesions (step 24).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure that the meninges covering the dorsal spinal cord are removed before inserting the Hamilton needle into the spinal cord. The tip of the needle may appear bent if it is not properly inserted. Ensure the needle is inserted off center to the right side of the midline so the injection does not erroneously occur through the ventral median fissure of the spinal cord.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Open sutures are found in mice after spinal cord surgery (step 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use interrupted sutures or staples for closing the wound on the back.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Insufficient microglia depletion (step 26).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check that the genotype of the CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup>:Rosa26<sup>iDTR</sup> mice is correct. This may be done using PCR according to instructions from JAX (For CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup> see <a href="https://www.jax.org/Protocol?stockNumber=021160&amp;protocolID=24463">https://www.jax.org/Protocol?stockNumber=021160&amp;protocolID=24463</a>; for Rosa26<sup>iDTR</sup> see <a href="https://www.jax.org/Protocol?stockNumber=007900&amp;protocolID=22285">https://www.jax.org/Protocol?stockNumber=007900&amp;protocolID=22285</a>). Alternatively, CX3CR1<sup>CreER</sup> expression may be validated by EYFP expression and Rosa26<sup>iDTR</sup> expression may be validated by an anti-DTR antibody. Also check that the DT used was reconstituted and stored appropriately and within the expiration date.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Spinal cord sections contain holes formed from water crystals throughout the tissue (step 36).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check that fixation and dehydration are properly completed. Properly fixed and dehydrated spinal cords should be rubbery and should sink in 30% sucrose solution. Warm and air-dry microscope slides with spinal cord sections at 22°C–24°C before proceeding to staining steps.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.15">Problem 8</h3>
<p>High background signals from immunofluorescence (step 46).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.16">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If using mouse derived primary antibodies, ensure that Fc receptors are blocked. Check antibody specificity to the tissue sections with appropriate isotype controls, secondary antibody controls, and sham/normal tissue controls. Check the laser power, gain, and offset are appropriately set and consistently for image acquisition.</p>
