<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Tracking individual cell movement during development is challenging, particularly in tissues subjected to major remodeling. Currently, most live imaging techniques in <i>Xenopus</i> are limited to tissue explants and/or to superficial cells. We describe here a protocol to track immature multiciliated cells (MCCs) moving within the inner epidermal layer of a whole embryo. In addition, we present a data processing protocol to uncouple the movements of individual cells from the coplanar drifts of the tissue in which they are embedded.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2021.02.026">Chuyen et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol provides a comprehensive and detailed description of live imaging techniques aimed at tracking individual cell movements <i>in vivo</i> during <i>Xenopus laevis</i> embryonic development. The essential materials are <i>X. laevis</i> embryos, spinning-disk confocal microscope, the commercial software Metamorph, the open source software Fiji (ImageJ) and Python scripts. Cells are fluorescently labelled in living <i>X. laevis</i> embryos by standard microinjection of plasmid DNA and mRNA. In the present case, where MultiCiliated Cells (MCCs) are tracked, the expression of green fluorescent proteins in free form or fused to other proteins or peptides, such as LifeAct, is under the control of the MCC-specific <i>α-tub</i> promoter (<a href="#bib16">Stubbs et al., 2006</a>). To this aim, 8- to 16-cell-stage <i>Xenopus</i> embryos are injected as described below.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Step 1: Expression of fluorescent proteins in <i>xenopus</i> embryos</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3–4 days</div>
<p>The protocol is adapted from Early Development of <i>Xenopus laevis</i>: A Laboratory Manual (<a href="#bib15">Sive et al., 2000</a>) and Obtaining <i>Xenopus laevis</i> embryos (<a href="#bib14">Shaidani et al., 2021</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>To obtain <i>X. laevis</i> eggs, stimulate ovulation in <i>X. laevis</i> adult females by subcutaneous injection of (800 units/animal) Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (Chorulon<sup>R</sup>) into the dorsal lymph sacs.</li>
<li>From 16 to 24 h post-stimulation, collect eggs from stimulated females by manual squeezing. Eggs are collected in empty Petri dishes.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Perform <i>in vitro</i> fertilization with sperm from adult males.
<ol type="a">
<li>To collect sperm for <i>in vitro</i> fertilization, the males need to be euthanized to explant the testes. Males are euthanized by immersion in a 2 liter bath of benzocaine solution (2,6 mL/L) through immersion of frogs in benzocaine bath (2 liter per frog) for 15 min followed by cervical sectioning of the spinal cord posterior to the skull.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Before cervical sectioning, check that the male is unresponsive to foot pinching with tweezers.</div>
Using dissection scissors, cut through the skin and the abdominal muscles to open the lower abdominal cavity on the ventral side.<br> The testes are found on the dorsal side of the cavity, on either side of the aorta, behind the fat bodies.<br> Cut the testes out and trim away any attached fat and viscera. Transfer at 4°C in 0.1<b>×</b> MBS (Modified Barth’s Saline; see the recipe for 1<b>×</b> MBS below) for <i>in vitro</i> fertilization on the same day.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> testes can be stored at 4°C in Leibovitz's L-15 Medium, GlutaMAX™ Supplement culture media (ThermoFisher) for up to a week without significant loss of sperm viability.</div>

<ol start="4">
<li>De-jelly the fertilized eggs with gentle agitation for about 10 min in 2% cysteine in 0.1<b>×</b> MBS at pH 8. The cysteine solution should be prepared immediately before use. Once the jelly-coat is dissolved and the eggs have started to pack, wash extensively in water to remove the cysteine. Note: Prolonged exposure to cysteine will damage embryos.</li>
<li>Keep embryos in 0.1<b>×</b> MBS at 13°C, 18°C or 23°C until they reach the stage suitable for injection (8- or 16-cell).</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min</div>
<p>Immobilization of samples is the key step for successful live imaging (<a href="#bib1">Bostock et al., 2020</a>). The α-tub-driven expression of fluorescent reporter proteins in MCCs becomes detectable around stage 14 (25 h post fertilization at 18°C) but in the following hours the embryonic epidermis is subjected to significant strains due to embryo elongation, which can affect the process of image acquisition. The method we propose here is a home-made montage to limit tissue movement during live imaging. A list of possibly encountered problems has been established (see <a href="#sec6.1">problems 1</a> and <a href="#sec6.3">2</a> in Troubleshooting).</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>As soon as embryos reach stage 14, sort the fluorescently labeled embryos under a stereomicroscope (excitation/emission settings for GFP (488/510) and RFP (532/588)).</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Due to the mosaicism caused by unequal plasmid inheritance, not all MCCs may be labeled and fluorescence intensity may increase with time, leading to the detection of additional MCCs during recording.

<h3 id="sec3.3">Step 3: Spinning-disk confocal live imaging of MCCs in embryonic epidermis</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2–8 h</div>
<p>MCCs start expressing fluorescent reporters when they are still irregularly distributed within the inner layer of the epidermis. During image acquisition, MCCs first migrate within the plane of the inner layer to disperse at regular intervals and later migrate radially to intercalate among outer-layer cells. To record the movements of MCCs through the thickness of the two epidermal layers, we use spinning-disk confocal microscopy to acquire z-stack images at high speed. Our protocol was designed to characterize MCC movements relative to each other and to outer-layer cell junctions. We also wanted to measure the time of contact between MCCs, the evolution of MCC speed relative to mutual contact events and the MCC migration path relative to outer-layer cell junctions.</p>
<p>Thus, it is critical to choose samples in which MCC labeling and orientation are optimal. Since MCCs randomly migrate laterally, some MCCs may exit the region of interest, while others may enter it. For the successful exploitation of time-lapse movies, it is essential to maintain the same field of view via frequent manual realignment.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> As the embryo has a convex surface, the ideal region to be filmed is where the epidermis is flattened by contact with the coverslip.</div>
<ol start="17">
<li>Position the coverslip ‘sandwich’ in the imaging chamber of the Nikon Roper spinning-disk Eclipse Ti inverted confocal microscope.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">

<li>Choose the objective and select the optimal field with mercury lamp HBO 50 W fluorescent illumination.</li>
<li>Set up microscope for z-stack time-lapse acquisition: 20μm-deep Z sections; z-step = 0.5–0.7 μm; 2 frames averaging; time interval 30 s–2 min (depending on the number of channels used).</li>
<li>Adjust exposure time and laser power to the fluorescence intensity of the different channels.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> the z stack acquisition time must be at least 5–10 sec shorter than the time interval between stacks (see step 12).</div>
<ol start="21">
<li>Select a field of interest and set your stacks range taking as reference the 561 nm channel and the surface of the outer layer cells for the most apical z and the 491 nm channel, which labels the MCCs within the inner layer for the most basal z.</li>
<li>Launch time-lapse acquisition for 2–10 h. Note: Although some fluorescent cellular debris can be observed (<a href="#bib8">Icha et al., 2017</a>) the use of a fluorescent caspase activity reporter never revealed significant cell death (<a href="#bib3">Chuyen et al., 2021</a>). However, tissue collapse has been reported in experiments which last longer than 10 h .</li>
<li>During embryo development, morphogenetic movements will cause displacements in X, Y or Z direction.

<p>Raw data obtained with spinning-disk confocal time-lapse imaging are processed for image and movie visualization and further quantification as indicated below. The multidimensional images are processed with the imageJ/Fiji free software and two individual homemade Python scripts.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Z-stacks from confocal video microscopy are converted into single plane projection by maximum intensity or sum intensity projection. Each channel is processed separately with the optimized z-section corresponding to the outer/inner layer cell staining.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="25">
<li>Stabilization of movements caused by tissue growth in the x,y axis is done as following:
<ol type="a">
<li>With “manual tracking “Fiji plugin (<a href="https://imagej.net/plugins/manual-tracking">https://imagej.net/plugins/manual-tracking</a>), a single vertex is tracked frame by frame to extract its coordinates as reference for movie stabilization.</li>

<li>We then use the “Image Stabilizer” Fiji plugin (<a href="https://imagej.net/Image_Stabilizer">https://imagej.net/Image_Stabilizer</a>), which implements the Lucas-Kanade algorithm to further stabilize the movie (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#mmc5">Methods video S1</a>).

<p>Initial time point (top) and final time point (bottom) from projection of time-lapse movies (<a href="#mmc5">Methods video S1</a>) are shown in original, refocused and stabilized format (refer to Quantification and Statistical Analysis, step 1 to 2). In the original movie, a reference vertex (white arrowhead) is tracked frame by frame through the movie. Using extracted coordinate of the tracked vertex, images are refocused to preserve the original position of that vertex. Next, stabilized images are obtained by using the “Image Stabilizer” Fiji plugin, which implements the Lucas-Kanade algorithm to further stabilize the movie. On the bottom images, the dotted squares demarcate the conserved frame with stabilized position. In the original movie, the tracked vertex has drifted from its initial position. In refocused and stabilized movies, the frame of interest is repositioned to maintain the tracked vertex on its initial position. Note that in refocused and stabilized movies, the MCC tracked in white has been cut by the reframing. Consequently, after reframing only MCCs within the conserved frame can be scored.</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Depending on the filmed region, embryo morphogenetic movements can cause heterogeneous tissue deformation, which complicates image stabilization.

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Finding position of MCCs can be difficult (see point 5 in <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a>).</div>
</li>
<li>Another Python 3 script has been developed to generate a set of “behavioral descriptors” using the tracked MCC centroid file to further characterize the migratory behavior of MCCs: distance of displacement, cumulative travelled distance, migration direction, instant velocity. (see: <a href="https://github.com/fabda/mcc_paper/analysis.py">https://github.com/fabda/mcc_paper/analysis.py</a>). This script is fully parameterizable by the user: smoothing of centroid position (x,y) to avoid manual tracking artifacts (sigma parameter), smoothing of stabilization throughout the whole movie (window parameter), unit of measure relationship (pixmicron parameter), unit of time relationship (framesec parameter). An excel file is then generated containing all the “behavioral descriptors” for the given movie.</li>

<p>MCC spacing pattern in <i>X. laevis</i> had been addressed in several studies but live description of cellular behavior was missing (<a href="#bib5">Deblandre et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#bib16">Stubbs et al., 2006</a>). Over the past decade, radial intercalation of MCCs into the outer layer of the epidermis has been documented by video-microscopy (<a href="#bib2">Chung et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib17">Szabó et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib13">Sedzinski et al., 2016</a>, <a href="#bib12">2017</a>; <a href="#bib9">Kulkarni et al., 2018</a>). However, cell movements within the plane of the epidermis have only been recently analyzed in live embryos (<a href="#bib3">Chuyen et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib4">Collins et al., 2021</a>). Using this protocol, MCCs can be observed in live <i>X. laevis</i> by spinning-disk fluorescent confocal microscopy (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A, <a href="#mmc1">Methods video S2</a>). In addition, actin cytoskeleton dynamics can be monitored by expressing actin binding fluorescent peptides such as LifeAct::GFP (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B, <a href="#mmc2">Methods video S3</a>), or actin nucleation promoting factors of the Arp2/3 complex, such as eGFP-p41 (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C, <a href="#mmc3">Methods video S4</a>).</p>

<p>The generation of a regular distribution pattern of MCCs within the embryonic epidermis takes place between embryonic stages 14 and 25 in a time window of 10 h at 23°C. The regular spacing of MCCs relies on two concomitant phenomena: mutual repulsion among migrating MCCs and their affinity for outer-layer cell junctions, which constrains their motility and favors their positioning at vertices (junctions between 3 or more outer-layer cells), where they intercalate.</p>
<p>For most MCCs, these two phenomena can be detected within the first 3–5 h of recording. The lateral motility of MCCs then significantly decreases and is replaced by apical motility and radial intercalation for the last 5 h of the process. In <a href="#bib3">Chuyen et al. (2021)</a> time-lapse imaging was focused on the first phase prior to radial intercalation. The movement of MCCs was manually tracked on stabilized movies and evolution in cell speed was correlated to MCC mutual contact events (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>D and 3E, <a href="#mmc4">Methods video S5</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Limitation 1</h3>
<p>Impossibility to record MCC behavior at early developmental stages.</p>
<p>The live imaging protocol presented here provides detailed information on the dynamic behavior of MCCs within the inner layer and their lateral migration before the cells initiate radial intercalation into the outer layer. While data published in <a href="#bib3">Chuyen et al. (2021)</a> revealed that immature MCCs display migratory properties by stage 14, it is known that MCCs become fated at stage 11 (<a href="#bib5">Deblandre et al., 1999</a>), several hours before α-tub-mediated live imaging can be applied. Thus, the earliest phase of MCC behavior currently remains out of reach with our protocol, although this may change with the future characterization of earlier-active MCC-specific promoters.</p>
<p>Although our method was only applied to MCCs, other cell types populate the inner layer of the epidermis, such as ionocytes and small secretory cells. We speculate that the protocol presented here will be applicable to characterize their behavior after generation of constructs able to drive expression of fluorescent reporters in immature ionocytes (<a href="#bib16">Stubbs et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#bib11">Quigley et al., 2011</a>), small secretory cells (<a href="#bib6">Dubaissi et al., 2014</a>) or basal cells (<a href="#bib7">Haas et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Limitation 2</h3>
<p>Impossibility to record MCC behavior over more than eight hours.</p>
<p>In <a href="#bib3">Chuyen et al. (2021)</a>, live imaging usually lasted 3–5 h. When attempting to record for more than 10 h, the integrity of embryos was lost, making it impossible to film the entire sequence of events from the initial spacing of MCCs up until their emergence at the surface of the epidermis. It is possible that the low melting point agar required to limit tissue movement during image acquisition eventually prevents proper embryo morphogenesis and/or survival. In unpublished data, we have been able to track MCCs during radial intercalation, but we foresee that the same limitations for long-term imaging may apply and may be aggravated by the acquisition of muscle contractility later in development.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Embryo embedding problems (related to step 2)</p>
<p>Possible problems may arise during embryo embedding:</p>
<p>Embryos are deformed when the silicon chamber is sealed by the second coverslip</p>
<p>Embryos exit the silicon chamber when the coverslip is applied</p>
<p>Embryos are crushed when the second coverslip is applied</p>
<p>The second coverslip does not stick to the first one</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Several reasons can non-exclusively explain embedding issues</p>
<p>The agar hardens too fast:</p>
<p>The time from agar deposition to chamber sealing should not exceed two minutes, to avoid the agar from hardening and deforming embryos or even crushing them. It often happens that the time needed to orient embryos is too long and the agar starts to harden, resulting in the deformation of embryos when the top coverslip is applied. We recommend mounting a maximum of 5 embryos, which allows enough time to optimize orientation before the agar hardens.</p>
<p>Too much liquid is poured in the silicon chamber:</p>
<p>If the volume of molten agar plus the culture medium containing the embryos exceeds the chamber capacity, the application of the top coverslip will chase away the excess liquid and the embryos might be carried away with the flow. We recommend not to exceed 4 drops of molten agar and adding as little liquid as possible when embryos are deposited. It is also important that the chamber is not completely sealed otherwise air bubbles might chase away the liquid and embryos. Moreover, liquid covering the silicon grease may prevent adherence to the coverslip.</p>
<p>The molten agar is too warm:</p>
<p>Hot agar will affect embryo integrity, which will become less resistant to embedding</p>
<p>The amount of silicon is not adapted:</p>
<p>If too much silicon grease is deposited on the coverslip, the capacity of the chamber may be reduced and may cause it to close, which would prevent expulsion of air bubbles. On the contrary, if not enough silicon is applied, the two coverslips may not properly stick to each other and embryos may be crushed during mounting.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Difficulty to expose the region of interest during embryo embedding (related to step 2)</p>
<p>With our embedding method, it is not possible to precisely orient the sample, such that GFP-positive MCCs can be optimally exposed to be filmed.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To limit this risk, we recommend injecting over 15 embryos per condition.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>x, y or z drift during image acquisition (related to step 3)</p>
<p>A major aim of this protocol is to give insights about sample immobilization during image acquisition through embedding (steps 2–5). We develop here potential solutions to limit drift in x, y and z positions and scenarios in which it is preferable to stop image acquisition because excessive drift may result in non-exploitable data (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>, <a href="#mmc6">Methods videos S6</a>, <a href="#mmc7">S7</a>, and <a href="#mmc8">S8</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Wisely choose the region of interest</p>
<p>Embedding results in flattening of the epidermis in contact with the coverslips (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>G, right panel). We do not recommend selecting a zone of interest on the border of the flattened region as the drift might increase as the embryo grows. We instead recommend selecting a zone of interest in the center of the flattened region where the drift in x,y axis is lower and where outer-layer cell junctions are on the same z plane, making it easier to maintain the focus.</p>
<p>Check the evolution of the movie and adjust manually in x, y and z:</p>
<p>As image acquisition takes place on the Metamorph software, images will be automatically saved. In parallel to image acquisition, open the saved images with FIJI/ImageJ software to visualize and annotate the evolution of the sample over time (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Use the arrow tool to track the position of a reference point in outer layer cell junction at time 0 (a given vertex can be an ideal reference). Measure in which direction the vertex moves in the x and y axis to estimate the direction of the drift and its severity. Then during the 10 s lap between two z series acquisition, use the control joystick to manually adjust the position of the frame so as to place the reference vertex back on its initial position, allowing to track the same frame over time. For z adjustment, play the movie at a given and easy to recognize z plane (apical surface for example). Any change on the observed plane will indicate a drift in z axis, in which case adjustment in z must be done manually, similar to x/y adjustment.</p>

<p><i>In silico</i> stabilization of movies:</p>
<p>The image processing method presented above will easily deal with minor drifts in x and y axes, as long as the focus in z axis allows visualizing the outer-layer cell junctions. Be aware, however, that reframing will inevitably cause cropping around the initial region of interest, and loss of information outside that region (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Heterogeneous tissue remodeling complicates image stabilization (related to step 4)</p>
<p>Our protocol easily allows for image stabilization in tissues undergoing homogeneous deformation, but its efficiency may decrease as heterogeneities in tissue deformation emerge. Obviously, the perception of heterogeneous deformation is scale-dependent and more severe when movies are taken at lower magnification. Our protocol was initially designed for 40–60<b>×</b> magnification experiments aimed at tracking few interacting MCCs (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>A and 6B, <a href="#mmc1">Methods video S9</a>). However, filming at lower magnification can be useful, as this increases the number of cells visible per field and thus allows a faster and more representative quantification of the phenomenon (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>C and 6D, <a href="#mmc10">Methods video S10</a>). In our stabilization protocol, vertices from outer layer junctions serve as physical reference to identify and correct the drift (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>A’–6D′). At 40<b>×</b> magnification, the image stabilization significantly reduces the drift (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>A, 6B, 6A′, 6B′, and 6F, <a href="#mmc9">Methods video S9</a>) (<a href="#bib3">Chuyen et al., 2021</a>). However, this may not be sufficient at 20<b>×</b> magnification, as the tissue is exposed to heterogeneous remodelling (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>C, 6D, 6C′, 6D′, and 6 F, <a href="#mmc10">Methods video S10</a>). Indeed, the quality of image stabilization varies relative to the distance from the vertex used as reference: regions closer to the reference point will be properly stabilized (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>C’ and 6D′, dark blue dot and line, <a href="#mmc10">Methods video S10</a>), while the more distant ones are still drifting (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>C’ and 6D′, light blue and red dots and lines). Thus, live-imaging at 20<b>×</b> magnification significantly increases the variability of the drift (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>F) to an extent that may compromise the quantifications of MCC motility.</p>

<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>As shown in <a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>A–6D and 6F, the quality of image stabilization significantly decreases with wider fields obtained with lower magnification. Since the intensity of the post-stabilization drift is proportional to the distance from the reference point, we recommend to crop the movie in smaller areas (e.g., white dotted square, <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>D) when the sample is facing heterogeneous drift, and independently stabilize each crop (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>E and 6F). In each crop, a reference vertex central to the image may be used for movie stabilization (e.g., white arrowhead in <a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>D and 6E). This approach shows significant improvement in reducing local drift compare to wider fields (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>F). We recommend to carefully check stabilized movies to avoid counting artificial movements due to improper stabilization.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Difficulty to identify individual MCCs during cell tracking (related to step 4)</p>
<p>Because of mosaicism caused by plasmid injection, all MCCs are unequally labeled. Furthermore, new MCCs starting to express the plasmid later may emerge during image acquisition. High MCC density and signal heterogeneity are an issue when tracking individual MCCs at early stages.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When identification of MCCs at early stage is difficult, one solution is to reverse time on Fiji (Image &gt; Stacks &gt; Tools &gt; reverse). This way individual cells which are easily identifiable at the end of movies will be easier to track.</p>
