<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Gastrointestinal motility is regulated by a variety of environmental factors including gut microbes and metabolites. The ability to interrogate mouse models of gut motility has enabled elucidation of these relationships. Here we describe integration of the red carmine dye and fluorescence isothiocyanate-dextran marker-based assays for characterizing gut transit with spatial resolution, along with an optional intracolonic infusion protocol for studying the effects of metabolites on colonic transit. These protocols can be adapted for use in gnotobiotic and conventional mouse models.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00644-4/sref1">Li et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The protocol below describes steps for studying gut transit in gnotobiotic or conventional mouse models. For guidance on working with gnotobiotic mice, please see (<a href="#bib4">Zucoloto et al., 2021</a>). We have adopted the commonly used red carmine dye assay to include intra-colonic administration of metabolites to test effects on gut transit times. We combine this approach with an assay utilizing the FITC-dextran fluorophore to spatially resolve whole-gut transit.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Prepare reagents</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–4 h</div>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the necessary reagents described below. 200 μL per mouse of 6% carmine or 5 mg/mL FITC-dextran are administered for these assays. We recommend estimating the total volume needed per assay and preparing 10% more reagent than required.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Sterilize reagents prior to use. We use 0.2 μm pore-diameter sterile filters for FITC-dextran, and we autoclave methylcellulose and carmine.</div>
<ol type="a">
<li>Prepare 0.5% methylcellulose solution. Using a hot plate, glass beaker, and magnetic stir bar, heat ∼1/3 total final water volume to 80°C with agitation and add the methylcellulose powder. Once particles are dissolved, add the remaining volume of water and cool solution to 0°C–5°C for 20–40 min. Store at 4°C until use.</li>
<li>Prepare 6% carmine solution. Add carmine to a 0.5% methylcellulose solution and heat with a magnetic stir bar until the carmine dissolves. Autoclave for 30 min at 122.8°C and 23.8 pounds per square inch. Store at 4°C until use.</li>
<li>Prepare FITC-dextran stock solution (20 mg/mL). We use 70,000 MW FITC-dextran as adapted from (<a href="#bib2">Samuel et al., 2008</a>). Allow FITC-dextran to dissolve in 1<b>×</b> PBS by wrapping in foil, vortexing, and placing at 4°C for 4 h. Dilute 250 μL stock solution with 750 μL PBS to obtain 5 mg/mL FITC-dextran solution. Filter-sterilize, wrap in aluminum foil, and store at −20°C until use.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Methylcellulose and carmine are stable at 4°C for 1 year and to light; we recommend preparing carmine fresh for each experiment. FITC-dextran, which is light- and temperature-sensitive, should be wrapped in foil and stored at −20°C (stable for 6 months) or 4°C (stable for 3–4 weeks) prior to use.</div>
</li>
<li>Prepare 4 mM solutions of the bile acids to test. Our practice is to prepare solutions within 24 h of use and store at 4°C if needed. Dissolve 20 mg of bile acid in 5 mL of recommended solvent using a beaker and magnetic stir bar. Taurocholic acid and deoxycholic acid can both be dissolved in water or PBS. We recommend using PBS to account for dilution of other bile acids. Lithocholic acid should be dissolved in DMSO. Cholic acid and β-muricholic acid must first be dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO, then diluted with 4 mL PBS.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> These experiments can be conducted on conventional or gnotobiotic mice (germ-free or colonized). For guidance on working with gnotobiotic mice, please see (<a href="#bib4">Zucoloto et al., 2021</a>).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Careful consideration of sample size accounting for covariates of interest is recommended. To sufficiently power your study, consider performing a pilot study to determine effect sizes.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.1">Carmine red dye assay—Part 1</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2–8 h (conventional mice have shorter transit times, while germ-free mice have longer transit times)</div>
<p>Whole gut transit times can be quantified by administering the 6% carmine solution via oral gavage using a 1 mL syringe attached to a feeding needle and recording time to passage in the fecal stream. If working in the gnotobiotic setting, additional sterilization techniques should be followed during the carmine gavage and fecal observation (e.g., sterilization of the fume hood, cage, equipment, and reagents), and a sterile gown and gloves should be worn by research staff.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gavage each mouse with 150 μL of 6% carmine solution and record the time of administration.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It may be helpful to mark the tail of each mouse with a sequential number using a marker for easy identification (e.g. I, II, III, etc).</div>
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause point:</span> Given that whole gut transit times are typically ≥2 h after carmine gavage, a 2-h pause can be instituted prior to the first time point at which fecal pellets are examined.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Obtain fresh fecal pellets.
<ol type="a">
<li>Transfer each mouse individually into a sterile beaker or sterile plastic container (e.g., empty 1000 μL pipette tip box cleaned with 70% w/v ethanol) until a fecal pellet is produced.</li>
<li>Immediately after the production of a fecal pellet, return the mouse to its cage.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is helpful to cover the container with a weighted lid to minimize the risk of a mouse escaping. If no fecal pellets are seen within 5 min, it is reasonable to return the mouse to its cage and repeat this step in 5–10 min.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Assess fecal pellets for passage of red dye.
<ol type="a">
<li>Record all times at which assessments are made, including documentation of whether fecal pellets are produced and whether red carmine dye is seen at those times.</li>
<li>If the pellet contains <b>NO</b> red color, continue to repeat the observation every 20–30 min until a red pellet is seen. If the pellet clearly contains <b>red</b> dye, no further observations are required.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Smear fecal pellets on white tissue if there is a question of whether carmine passed, as this permits easier visualization.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Whole gut transit time is calculated as the time interval between the gavage and the first observed red fecal pellet. A fecal pellet that is partially red may constitute a red pellet if the red color is carefully examined and convincingly felt to represent carmine dye.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> If studying gnotobiotic mice, then the beaker or plastic container used to observe mice must first be sterilized (e.g. via autoclave). Containers should NOT be shared by mice harboring different microbiota.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We grant mice <i>ad libitum</i> access to food and water during the red carmine assay as it typically takes greater than 2 h and up to 8 h (particularly in gnotobiotic mice) to complete. If necessary, researchers can consider a standardized period of fasting, but the impacts of prolonged fasting on mouse health must be carefully considered.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We do NOT squeeze or apply pressure to the mouse abdomen to stimulate passage of fecal pellets, as stress also influences gut transit.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Typically, the time to clearance is not recorded for practical reasons, as it can take &gt;1 day; however, this could be considered with extended observation or through video monitoring of cages. “Time to clearance” is defined as the amount of time it takes for carmine to be passed in its entirety (i.e., the duration required for fecal pellets to no longer be red).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Transit times are sensitive to time of carmine gavage and the light/dark cycle; therefore, if intending to compare between cohorts, it is essential to standardize one’s protocol. We administer carmine between 8:00 and 8:30 AM local time. If needed, limit the number of mice that you are testing on a given day.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.2">Intra-colonic administration of bile acids (or other metabolites or treatments of interest)—Part 2 (optional)</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 0.5–1.5 h</div>
<p>Treatments of interest can be administered via intra-colonic infusion to characterize effects on the distal colon. Intra-colonic infusions are paired with the carmine red dye assay (Part 1) to quantify the effects of infusions on whole gut transit times. We have performed this in conventional mice only. Gnotobiotic mice will require additional sterility precautions not described here. Although we have not used it as such, this could potentially be paired with a rectal bead expulsion assay (<a href="#bib3">Soret et al., 2010</a>).</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Evaluate the safety and potential toxicity of administered substances prior to administration. Safety considerations should be given for both the mice and personnel administering the metabolites. All substances should be approved by the biosafety committee and animal ethics committee prior to use.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The timing of when to administer the metabolites of interest depends on how long the metabolites take to exert a physiologic effect and their half-life.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Select the appropriate controls for your experimental infusions (e.g. vehicle-only control).</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Since the carmine red dye assay is sensitive to the time of day at which it is performed and the light/dark cycle, it is essential that intra-colonic infusions and carmine gavages are performed as uniformly as possible (i.e., at the same times and intervals) across treatment groups.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Attach a feeding needle to a 1 mL syringe and aspirate 400 μL of infusion media. To minimize discomfort, apply a layer of petroleum jelly to the needle with a sterile Q-tip. Ensure the needle tip is covered.</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3–5 h</div>
<p>Characterization of intestinal distribution of an orally delivered fluorophore permits spatial resolution of gut transit. This step must be done after measuring transit times with carmine as it requires euthanization. Auto-florescence can be impacted by diet; therefore, it is important to perform a pilot experiment characterizing the impact of the mouse chow being used by quantifying fluorescence in mice not receiving FITC-dextran. Gnotobiotic mice will require additional sterilization precautions during the FITC gavage such as sterilization of the fume hood, cage, equipment, and reagents; additionally, a sterile gown and gloves should be worn by research staff.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol for measuring intestinal motility allows for the quantification of the whole gut transit time as well as the spatial resolution of intestinal transit. While whole gut transit times from the red carmine assay reflect the foremost tip of the digesta traversing through the gastrointestinal tract, spatial resolution as seen in the FITC-dextran assay enables characterization of the distribution of the digesta through the gastrointestinal tract. Whole gut transit times for different cohorts can be plotted and compared such as in Figure 2E (<a href="#bib1">Li et al., 2021</a>). Spatial resolution of different cohorts can be plotted as a smoothed curve or as geometric means like Figure 2D (<a href="#bib1">Li et al., 2021</a>).</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>FITC readings can be used in several ways. Transforming readouts into proportions of total FITC or absolute concentrations present in each gut segment or segment can be helpful in characterizing the spatial distribution of FITC using a smoothed curve. The total amount of FITC present throughout the gut can indicate recovery during the flushing procedure (if performed before FITC has fully transited through the gut i.e., in less time than the whole gut transit time) or how much might have already been passed in a fecal pellet. To compare FITC distributions between groups, we used the geometric mean (<i>g</i>) of fluorescence as a summary statistic, which we calculated using the following equation:</p>
<p class="math-ml"><math> <mrow> <mi>g</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mspace></mspace> <munderover> <mo>∑</mo> <mrow> <mi>i</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> <mn>12</mn> </munderover> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mi>i</mi> <mspace></mspace> <mo>×</mo> <mspace></mspace> <msub> <mtext>FITC</mtext> <mi>i</mi> </msub> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </math></p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>A strength of the carmine red dye assay is that it can be administered repeatedly; its primary limitation is that it does not yield spatial resolution — only whole gut transit times. In contrast, the FITC-dextran assay can only be used once, as it entails euthanasia; however, it offers spatial resolution.</p>
<p>Studying the effect of metabolites on other parts of the intestine using the protocols described here would be challenging due to difficulties infusing metabolites into the small intestine or proximal colon. A researcher might consider anterograde gavage into the stomach, but absorption (e.g., bile acid absorption in the small intestine) and modification may confound the results.</p>
<p>Another consideration is translocation of FITC-dextran out of the gut. Indeed, FITC can be used for measuring gut permeability, and the gut microbiome impacts permeability; therefore, microbiome-driven differences in translocation of FITC-dextran from the gut lumen into the blood stream could confound its use as a gut motility assay.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Fluorescence too high or too low to be quantitated by the plate reader (step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Establish a FITC standard curve for the plate reader as this allows for quantitation of FITC concentrations in samples with unknown concentrations. Establishing limits of detection is important because upper and lower limits are often instrument-specific and measurements will vary across plate readers from different manufacturers, even in samples with identical FITC concentrations. We made 10-fold dilution series using different starting concentrations of FITC-dextran (e.g., 1 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, 0.01 mg/mL vs. 0.5 mg/mL, 0.05 mg/mL, 0.05 mg/mL). We found that measurements from a ten-fold dilution series starting at 0.05 mg/mL were linear (R &gt; 0.99, R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.99) and captured the range of values we observed in samples from GI tract flushes.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly low fluorescence readouts in the FITC-dextran assay (step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Increase the time interval between the carmine and FITC-dextran assays. We have found that carmine decreases the measured fluorescence when added directly to wells containing known concentrations of FITC-dextran. As reported in our recent paper (<a href="#bib1">Li et al., 2021</a>), we found that a 72-h interval between assays was sufficient in our model to prevent significant interference by carmine.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Blockage of pipette tips during FITC sample processing due to the larger particles of the flushed intestinal material (step 18).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The particulate matter in flush contents is usually quite large and will fully settle to the bottom of the tube after approximately 5 min. If tips get blocked, we recommend using a wide bore pipette tip when performing the dilutions.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Outliers in FITC quantification (step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To get a sense for acceptable variation between triplicates, we first recommend assessing technical variation attributable to your instrument through repeat measurements of a known concentration of FITC. To minimize variability in measurements of your samples (i.e., the FITC flushes), we recommend gently shaking or pipetting up and down before transferring samples to the 96-well plate. In our experience, as reported in <a href="#bib1">Li et al., (2021)</a>, we found that data from triplicates were largely concordant. We observed just a single outlier in 1 set of triplicates (overall &lt;0.5% of cases); this outlier was &gt;5 standard deviations removed from the other replicates. The precise threshold that you set should be based on careful consideration of your data.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Difficulty performing intra-colonic administration of metabolites (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It helps to practice intra-colonic administration using sedation, although we would recommend against sedation in experiments due to effects of sedation on gut motility.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Difficulty flushing intestinal segments (step 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>FITC flushes are most easily performed through a two-person procedure in which person #1 uses forceps to initially stabilize and secure the gut segment over the 5 mL tube. After person #2 starts flushing PBS, person #1 will then use forceps to gently guide flushes down gut segments, thereby minimizing backflow and spillage. A third person can also be helpful in expediting the assay overall through management of the sample collection and storage.</p>
