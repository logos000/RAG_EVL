<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Liver fat content and the linked rate of export of triglyceride are central to the etiology of type 2 diabetes, as well as to the cardiovascular effects of fatty liver disease. Measurement in humans of intrahepatic and intrapancreatic fat content is described using magnetic resonance techniques and quantification of the rate of hepatic secretion of very low density lipoprotein using a non-isotopic competitive blocking of tissue uptake. This protocol is non-invasive, can be repeated sequentially, and does not involve ionizing radiation.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to (<a href="#bib14">Taylor et al., 2018</a>) and (<a href="#bib4">Al-Mrabeh et al., 2020b</a>).</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Overview</h3>
<p>In this protocol, step-by-step procedures to assess hepatic lipid metabolism and export will be explained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to quantify fat content within the liver and pancreas. Acquisition of raw data, data analysis to derive fat fraction image, and measurement of fat percentage were described. Also described are the detailed clinical and laboratory procedures to measure the rate of triglyceride output by the liver. The latter is achieved using a 75-min intralipid infusion, thus blocking clearance of very low density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL-TG) and permitting the time-dependent accumulation of newly synthesized VLDL-TG by the liver.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Ethics approval</h3>
<p>Participants were part of the mechanistic studies of the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT/ ISRCTN03267836) (<a href="#bib14">Taylor et al., 2018</a>;<a href="#bib1">Al-Mrabeh et al., 2020a</a>;<a href="#bib4">Al-Mrabeh et al., 2020b</a>). Ethical approval was obtained from the West of Scotland and North Tyneside Ethics Committees, and written consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.3">MR acquisition for intraorgan fat content</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15–30 min</div>
<p>The method is based on a modified magnetic resonance 3-point Dixon acquisition (<a href="#bib7">Glover and Schneider, 1991</a>) for separation of fat-water signals. We first used it to quantify fat content within the liver and the pancreas (<a href="#bib10">Lim et al., 2011</a>;<a href="#bib12">Steven et al., 2016a</a>;<a href="#bib13">Steven et al., 2016b</a>). The method was further refined for more precise measurement of intrapancreatic fat content (<a href="#bib3">Al-Mrabeh et al., 2017</a>). The modified fat fraction quantification method takes account of the multi-spectral nature of fat, R2∗ relaxation and noise bias correction (<a href="#bib9">Kühn et al., 2014</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Before data acquisition, access to an MRI scanner is required. We used a 3.0T Philips Achieva scanner (Best, The Netherlands), but see alternatives section.
<ol type="a">
<li>Scanner should be equipped with a receive coil array with at least six channels.</li>
<li>The scanner should be programmed to acquire 3-point Dixon and balanced turbo field echo (BTFE) sequences (also known as true-FISP sequences on some scanners). The 3-point Dixon scans can be set up and processed by experienced magnetic resonance physicists or commercial packages are available from MR vendors.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>After data acquisition, a PC with Intel Core I7 or above (Dell, USA) is required with the following software:
<ol type="a">
<li>MATLAB if physicists are processing fat fraction maps (MathWorks, USA).</li>
<li>ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Contraindications to MR scanning (or metallic implants) must be ascertained in advance and verified by a qualified radiographer. This includes cardiac pacemakers, aneurysm clips, certain metal implants, and claustrophobia. Unless a wide-bore scanner is used, it is not generally feasible to study individuals with BMI &gt; 45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.4">Measurement of hepatic lipoprotein-TG production</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30–45 min</div>
<p>This method is based on blocking tissue uptake of very low density lipoprotein triglycerides (VLDL1-TG) by intravenous intralipid infusion to study lipoprotein kinetics (<a href="#bib5">Al-Shayji et al., 2007</a>).</p>
<p>The method is based on competition between chylomicrons and larger VLDL particles (VLDL1) in binding to lipoprotein lipase (LPL). The intralipid emulsion contains chylomicron-like lipoprotein which, because of similar LPL binding characteristics, causes accumulation in plasma of newly released VLDL1-TG. Ultracentrifugation and density gradient techniques are used afterwards to separate the VLDL1 fraction from sequential blood during the infusion period (75 min). The rate of VLDL1-TG export can thus be derived. In our weight loss studies, all medications were terminated on the day before study, as this protocol may be affected by medications that alter lipid or carbohydrate metabolism. The only contra-indication to the test is presence of gross hypertriglyceridemia. No medications are known to interfere with the measurement.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.5">Clinical procedures</h3>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>These procedures will allow acquisition of separate MRI axial scans of the abdomen for measuring liver and intrapancreatic fat content (3-point Dixon). The Dixon acquisition contains three gradient-echo scans with adjacent out-of-phase and in-phase echoes (time to repetition/time to echo/averages/ flip angle=50 ms/3.45, 4.60, 5.75 ms/1/5°, bandwidth 435 Hz/pixel). Field of view was set according to patient size (400–480 × 300 mm), and zero filled to give a resolution of 1.39 × 1.40 mm. 5 mm thick sections were used to cover the pancreas during breath holding. Liver scans were acquired during breath holding to cover the liver with slice thickness 10 mm. A balanced turbo field echo (BTFE) image with 5 mm sections matched to the Dixon scan was acquired during breath holding, to distinguish high signal intensity from vessels with visceral fat with lower intensity signals from the pancreas. BTFE images contain a mixed T1/T2 contrast. This is used to delineate the boundaries of the pancreas from adjacent structures, including the surrounding visceral fat, the splenic vein, the superior mesenteric vessels the inferior vena cava and duodenum. Repetition time/echo time/flip angle = 3.1 ms/1.6 ms/40°, turbo factor 95, parallel imaging factor 2, bandwidth 1,156 Hz per pixel). The field of view and zero filling were matched to the Dixon imaging.</p>
<p>BTFE sequences are readily available on modern scanners. Dixon sequences can either be programmed by magnetic resonance physicists (as in this work) or commercial packages can be used to produce fat fraction maps are available from MR vendors.</p>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15 min</div>
<p>This is carried out using on a fully automated fashion using photometric technology on the Cobas 8000 modular analyzer series (Roche Diagnostics, UK). The assay is based on a series of enzymatic reactions to initially hydrolyze the triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids using lipoprotein lipase. For the assay, 2 μL of sample is mixed with 120 μL of triglyceride reagent (TRIGL, Roche) and 28 μL water. The assay takes 10 min with 38 readings taken within this timeframe to assess the increase of the absorbance at 505/700 nm which is proportional to triglyceride content.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>At baseline after the overnight fasted state (10–12 h), VLDL-TG concentration in blood will be steady despite continue hepatic VLDL-TG export as production will equal tissue uptake. However, during the intralipid infusion, the intralipid particles (Sf &gt; 400) will compete with larger VLDL particles (VLDL1: Sf 60–400) for binding to the lipoprotein lipase enzyme (LPL) (<a href="#bib6">Bjorkegren et al., 1996</a>). As hepatic export of VLDL1-TG continues at a steady rate, a progressive rise in plasma VLDL1-TG level is brought about (<a href="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/497-Mmc1.pdf">Figure S7</a>). Analysis of VLDL1-TG level in each of the sequential blood samples taken during the 75 min infusion permits quantification of the rate of hepatic VLDL1-TG production (<a href="#bib5">Al-Shayji et al., 2007</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">MR studies</h3>
<p>The disadvantage of using MR is that it is an expensive technique and to initiate the measurements described required specialized staff (MR physicists). However, the MRI scanners are now available in most research centers, and recently MR vendors have introduced options to produce abdominal fat fraction maps at the scanner.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Lipoprotein studies</h3>
<p>A limitation of this method is the need to medical expertise for intralipid infusion. Another limitation is the long time to create the density gradient and centrifugation process. However, this could be circumvented by using micro-ultracentrifuge that can save 50% of the required time.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The image quality of MRI is sensitive to respiratory motion. All MR acquisitions require holding breath for 12–16 s. While most people can easily hold breath for this time, some people with breathing difficulties may not. In addition, the pancreas is not well supported within the abdomen, which make it affected by the involuntary movement of other surrounding organs including the stomach and the intestines.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Careful screening by the radiographers of the acquired data. It is important that the participants are trained in breath holding in advance of entering the scanner, and the scan protocol is executed properly. Participants are asked to breathe normally in and out for 3 times before being asked to hold their breath.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Pancreas volume is small and has irregular border in type 2 diabetes (<a href="#bib2">Al-Mrabeh et al., 2016</a>;<a href="#bib1">Al-Mrabeh et al., 2020a</a>). Proper positioning of the MR-opsy in the head, body, and tail of the pancreas requires care when the pancreas is small or with high fat infiltration (<a href="#bib3">Al-Mrabeh et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Although thresholding can overcome the issue of variance between slices as illustrated (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>/<a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>), careful position of the MR-opsy selection is required when the pancreas has high fat infiltration (<a href="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/497-Mmc1.pdf">Figure S8</a>).</p>
<p>The size of the MR-opsy (100 mm<sup>2</sup>) was chosen to enable easy selection of homogeneous areas at the three main regions of the pancreas (<a href="#bib3">Al-Mrabeh et al., 2017</a>). However, in those extremely small pancreas (&lt;30 cm<sup>3</sup>), selection could be restricted to one slice only and there could be major overlap between ROIs during the MR-opsy procedures (<a href="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/497-Mmc1.pdf">Figure S9</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>For subjects with large BMI, the subject with the phased array coil in position cannot fit into the bore of the scanner.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Where it is permitted, the use of multiple flexible surface coils may be suitable (e.g., on the Philips platform the large and medium flex coils can be combined around the subject’s body and permit high BMI subjects to enter the scanner).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Very rarely, the fat fractions obtained from the MATLAB script are inverted (pure fat structures are represented as low signal intensity).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This occurs when the there is a large displacement of the resonance frequency (a large B0 offset) at the center of the image. The script has a dialog box that allows the issue to be reported and can then force the opposite allocation of water and fat.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Mismatch in FOV or prescription between Dixon and BTFE scans.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Problems in analysis can occur if the two scans have not been exactly been matched for FOV or anatomical location. These should be avoided at the time of installing the protocol. Mismatches in FOV can be dealt with through registration algorithms beyond the scope of this article, but mismatch in prescription will require a rescan of the subject.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Blood withdrawal is not successful.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Finding the blood vessel for overweight people with type 2 diabetes could be sometimes difficult. If this happens, the cannulation procedures should be repeated. The venflon should be flushed frequently (every 5 min), and the arm kept warm with heat packs.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Participant has vaso-vagal episode relating to intravenous cannulae movement.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is very unusual. The whole procedures of intralipid infusion is medically safe. The participant may feel a little of salty taste due to accumulation of triglycerides in blood. Appropriate screening for trypanophobia is required during recruitment. If participant was uncomfortable, the procedures should be terminated.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.15">Problem 8</h3>
<p>The available amount of plasma for lipoprotein separation is less than 2 mL for some time points. The ultracentrifuge tubes need to be balanced accurately during the run.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.16">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make up the volume to 2 mL by addition from 1.006 g/mL density solution. Keep a note of the original plasma volume to work out the correct concentration of VLDL1-TG.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.17">Problem 9</h3>
<p>Participant has too much lipid in blood. This is evident to the naked eye as a solid cake of white lipid on the surface after centrifugation of plasma. It would approximate to a plasma total triglyceride concentration far above the normal range.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.18">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The protocol suggests collecting 1 mL after ultracentrifugation to remove the VLDL1-TG fraction. However, for some subjects who have high plasma VLDL-TG concentration, it is hard to recover all the lipids in such small volume. The lipids will form a hard to break layer on the top of the tube. In order to solve this, you need (i) break the lipid layer using the fine glass pipette (ii) try to withdraw some air while taking the lipid layer to create airflow. (iii) wash gently the borders of the tube to remove all the lipids. It is recommended to collect up to 2 mL, and to make a note of the final volume to work out the concentration correctly.</p>
