<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The classical aortic ring model is well suited for deciphering pro-angiogenic processes. Here, we propose simple modifications of the standard protocol to study various anti-angiogenic processes from growth arrest to capillary degeneration. Aortic rings are cultured under basal conditions for 6 days to allow physiological vessel sprouting and then split into treatment groups to follow capillary growth or degeneration for an additional 2 days.</p>




<div class="highlights">
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aortic rings sprout under basal conditions until day 5 and are treated on day 6 only</li>
<li>Growth rate analysis allows evaluation of vascular degeneration</li>
<li>The protocol can distinguish angiostatic from vascular degenerative processes</li>
<li>Paired statistical analysis confers additional power to the analysis</li>
</ul>

<li>Collagen polymerizes rapidly at 19°C–21°C. Prepare a small volume and use it immediately: mix 200 μL of the collagen stock solution with 200 μL DMEM, without glucose, in a hemolysis tube (the solution turns yellow [<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A; <a href="#mmc8">Methods Video S8</a>: Collagen solution preparation, step 22]) and equilibrate the pH with a few microliters of 5 N NaOH (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B; <a href="#mmc9">Methods Video S9</a>: pH equilibration, step 22).

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> After the addition of collagen, the DMEM solution will turn yellow due to acidification. 5 N NaOH is used to equilibrate it to a pH of 7 to 7.4.

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Physiological pH is required to culture aortic tissue. If NaOH is gradually added (i.e., 0.5 μL by 0.5 μL), the color of the red phenol is a sufficient indicator for equilibrating the pH (the presence of sodium bicarbonate in the DMEM will help to maintain a physiological pH when incubated in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator).

<p>The above protocol allows detection of the growth arrest of capillaries, as well as dynamic vascular degenerative processes.</p>
<p>The growth rate of aortic rings is determined by daily counting of the number of sprout under an inverted bright-field microscope. In contrast to the classical aortic ring protocol, it allows the identification of compounds with various angiogenic properties. In our example, group 1 and group 3 compounds do not change the basal growth rate, group 5 compounds show anti-angiogenic and angiostatic properties, and group 2 and 4 compounds show vascular degenerative properties (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A).</p>

<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>In contrast to the original protocol in which the rings are treated on day 0, this protocol allows stringent selection of solely actively sprouting aortic rings before their inclusion in a test group. Approximately 60% of the rings do not develop a satisfying sprouting response (&gt; 20 sprouts per ring). Such selection thus highly improves the statistical power of analysis and decreases the required quantity of the tested compounds.</p>
<p>The number of sprouts of each aortic ring is compared between day 6 (just before the treatment) and day 8 (two days after). This allows the use of paired statistical analysis, which improves the statistical power of the analysis. The number of sprouts per aortic ring follows a normal log distribution (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>B). We thus recommend analyzing the growth rate as the fold change for each individual ring using the following formula:</p>
<p>Log2(sprouts counted on day 8/sprouts counted on day 6)</p>
<p>Growing aortic rings will have values &gt;0 and degenerative aortic rings will have values &lt; 0.</p>
<p>If a sufficient number of replicates is used in the experiment (i.e., n = 12 per group), we recommend using parametric tests (t-test for two group comparisons or one-way ANOVA for comparisons of more than two groups) (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>A). If parametric test assumptions are not met, nonparametric tests can be used for comparisons (Mann-Whitney for two groups or Kruskal-Wallis for more than two groups).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Sprouts mainly originate from the sharp-cut side of aorta, thus the aorta have to be cut into rings to generate sprouts. However, manually cutting the aorta may result in irregularly sized aortic rings, which appears to correlate with sprouting capacity. We tested the use of a 1 and 2 mm puncher to produce aortic discs of regular shape and size to overcome this difficulty. Moreover, these 2D discs would be easier to observe and a single aorta could provide approximately 2 to 3 times more discs than those cut as rings. However, aortic punches failed to grow in the collagen matrix. Only half generated vessels and none generated enough vessels to be analyzed.</p>
<p>Thus, the ring shape spears to be necessary for sprouting for unknown reasons. Irregular size of the rings, which leads to wide log-normal distribution, is still one of the main limitations of this technique, with approximately only 40%–50% of embedded rings suitable for treatment and subsequent statistical analysis.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Floating aorta are difficult to clear from fibroadipose tissue or to cut into regular rings.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Keep the aorta in small volumes of culture medium during dissection and cutting to prevent it from drying and floating. It is also easier to cut the aorta on the lid of a Petri dish.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Presence of bubbles in the collagen matrix</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The release of trapped air within the pipet has to be avoided, as the solution rapidly polymerizes around the bubbles which thereafter remain captive in the matrix.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Collagen polymerizes unevenly, resulting in impaired sprouting.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This situation may be due to inefficient homogenization of the collagen, “DMEM no glucose” medium and NaOH. Always carefully homogenize the collagen working solution.</p>
<p>This situation may be the consequence of the collagen having already polymerized before embedding of the aortic ring. Always maintain the collagen solution on ice to prevent polymerization, prepare small volumes of collagen, do not fill more than three wells at a time with collagen, and use new tubes for each 400 μL of working collagen solution. If the collagen has already started to polymerize in the hemolysis tube, do not use it and prepare a new solution. If the collagen has started to polymerize in the culture well before the addition of the ring, do not use the well.</p>
<p>This situation may be due to presence of culture medium on the aortic ring or forceps when the aortic ring is embedded in the collagen solution. This will result in an inadequate concentration of collagen in the immediate proximity of the aortic ring for proper vessel structure formation. Always dry the forceps and aortic ring with absorbent tissue before embedding aortic ring in the collagen solution.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The ring does not stay still in the collagen solution.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Keep the ring in position with the forceps until the collagen starts to polymerize (30 s or 1 min should be sufficient) and then carefully remove the forceps. Do not keep the culture plate on ice, as this will prevent polymerization.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Rings do not sprout as much as anticipated</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A substantial fraction (50%–60%) of the rings will not grow sufficiently for experimentation and will have to be excluded before treatment. Always consider embedding more rings than the number required for the final analysis.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Rings do not sprout at all.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure not to have mistaken the aorta for the esophagus. <a href="#mmc2">Methods Video S2</a> illustrates the steps to isolate the aorta (if a hemorrhage occurs while dissecting, use absorbent tissue to remove the blood).</p>
<p>Make sure that the aorta has not been damaged or has dried during the process. Do not wait more than 45 min before adding the culture medium to the embedded aortic rings (Step 28).</p>
<p>Make sure that the aortic rings are well embedded in the collagen matrix.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Bacterial/fungal contamination</p>
<h3 id="sec6.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The entire procedure should be carried out in a sterile cabinet. Avoid any contact of the aorta with instruments that have touched the fur and do not make incision of the intestine. We recommend using Primocin at a 1:1,000 dilution during dissection and in the EBM culture medium added after gel polymerization (unless contraindicated for the experiment).</p>
