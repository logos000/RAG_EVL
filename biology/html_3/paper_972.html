<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Genetic dissection of neural circuits has been accelerated by recent advances in viral-based vectors. This protocol describes an effective approach to performing intraspinal injections of adeno-associated viruses, which can be used to label, manipulate, and monitor spinal and supraspinal neurons. By avoiding invasive laminectomies and restrictive spinal-clamping and by adopting injectable anaesthetics and tough quartz glass micropipettes, our protocol presents a time-saving and efficient approach for genetic manipulation of neural circuits nucleated in the spinal cord.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00492-5/sref31">Sathyamurthy et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The spinal cord plays a pivotal role in integrating, gating, and relaying somatosensory information, orchestrating movements, and controlling visceral functions. To accomplish these diverse functions, the spinal cord relies on a broad array of functionally specialized neurons. To determine the spinal correlates of any behavior, it is necessary to be able to specifically label and manipulate distinct populations of spinal neurons so as to unravel their connectivity and to test their contributions to specific aspects of sensorimotor and autonomic control.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, advances in AAV technology have significantly enhanced our understanding of the circuit mechanisms underlying spinal cord function by enabling the labelling and manipulation of specific populations of spinal neurons. Some advantages of AAVs over other anterogradely transporting viruses such as lentiviruses, canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), and herpes simplex viruses, are the high transduction efficiency, low toxicity, and stable transgene expression of AAVs (<a href="#bib39">Li et al., 2020</a>). Additionally, a huge library of ready-to-use AAVs expressing a wide variety of proteins, including Cre and Flp recombinases and Cre- and Flp-dependent and independent fluorescent reporters, optogenetic and chemogenetic actuators, and genetically encoded calcium indicators, are available from viral cores, including those at Addgene and several research institutions. Alternatively, custom-packaged recombinant AAV plasmids containing specific genes of interest can be obtained commercially (for example, Vigene Biosciences, Addgene, and Vector Biolabs), or can be produced in the lab (<a href="#bib38">Fripont et al., 2019</a>). A critical factor for successful delivery and expression of fluorescent proteins is the serotype of virus. In spinal cord research, anterogradely transporting AAVs containing the genome of serotype 2 packaged in capsids from serotypes 1, 2, 5, 8, or 9 (AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/5, AAV2/8, AAV2/9) have been routinely used for the manipulation of spinal neurons or ascending pathways (<a href="#bib11">Dougherty et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib13">Fink et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib5">Bourane et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib14">Foster et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib29">Ruder, Takeoka and Arber, 2016</a>; <a href="#bib7">Choi et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib34">Sheahan et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib2">Barik et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib16">Gatto et al., 2021</a>) (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>A and 1B), while AAV retro (<a href="#bib42">Tervo et al., 2016</a>), which is a capsid variant of AAV2, is used for targeting descending neurons (<a href="#bib12">Esposito et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib3">Basaldella et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib26">Murray et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib31">Sathyamurthy et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib35">Usseglio et al., 2020</a>) (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C). For more information on AAVs, please refer to the following reviews (<a href="#bib39">Li et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib40">Naso et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib41">Samulski and Muzyczka, 2014</a>; <a href="#bib43">Wang et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p>Genetically-defined groups of spinal neurons and the circuits that they are embedded in can be manipulated using two different groups of AAVs – anterogradely transporting (A and B) and retrogradely transporting AAVs (C). By injecting recombinant anterogradely transporting AAVs into different segments of the spinal cord in wildtype mice or genetic reporter lines, it is possible to acutely manipulate select spatially defined populations of spinal neurons, specifically in adulthood (<a href="#bib11">Dougherty et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib13">Fink et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib5">Bourane et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib14">Foster et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib29">Ruder, Takeoka and Arber, 2016</a>; <a href="#bib7">Choi et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib34">Sheahan et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib2">Barik et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib16">Gatto et al., 2021</a>) (A). By combining spinal injections of anterogradely transporting AAVs with stereotactic injections of retrogradely transporting AAVs in brain regions that are targeted by ascending spinal neurons, and/or by the placement of optic fibers or drug cannulae in specific brain regions, it is possible to manipulate ascending pathways in a circuit-specific manner (<a href="#bib8">Conner et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib13">Fink et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib6">Bouvier et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib15">François et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib34">Sheahan et al., 2020</a>) (B). Spinal injections of retrogradely transporting AAV (AAVretro) (Tervo et al. 2016) combined with stereotactic injections of anterogradely transporting viral vectors in the brain enables the targeting of functionally and somatotopically distinct groups of supraspinal neurons that communicate with specific segments of the spinal cord (<a href="#bib12">Esposito, Capelli and Arber, 2014</a>; <a href="#bib3">Basaldella et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib26">Murray et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib31">Sathyamurthy et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib35">Usseglio et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p>Here we describe a streamlined technique for intraspinal injection of recombinant viral vectors into the spinal cord. While the protocol focuses on the injection of adenovirus associated viral vectors, it can be used to deliver other viruses and chemical tracers such as fluorogold, cholera toxin B, and retrobeads.</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Petri dish containing surgery tools (refer to step 2).</li>
<li>Petri dish containing absorption triangles (refer to step 3).</li>
<li>15 or 50 mL or tubes containing povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol solutions.</li>
<li>A tray containing wound clips and applier, adhesive tape, eye lubricant, and sutures.</li>
<li>Infrared warming pad and regulator.</li>
<li>Metal surgery plate and retractors (for cervical surgery) (part of the Magnetic Fixator Retraction System, see <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a>) for holding the mouse and the retracted skin and muscle in place, respectively.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Sterilize surgical tools and supplies, including forceps, fine scissors, micro scissors, 100 mm glass Petri dish, and retractor hooks in an autoclave before transferring them to the surgery bench. Wrap all the items in aluminum foil and autoclave them at 132°C [270°F] (temperature) and 207 kPa (pressure) for 10 min. Once the items have been autoclaved, transfer the items to the surgery area. Alternatively, surgical equipment can be autoclaved in advance and stored for later use.
<ol type="a">
<li>If using unsterilized wooden cotton swabs, place cotton swabs in a clean glass beaker with the cotton tip facing down, cover the beaker with aluminum foil, and sterilize in an autoclave. Transfer the required number of swabs to a clean Petri-dish or glass beaker in the surgery area. The rest can be covered and stored in a glass beaker for later use.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Surgical tools can also be sterilized by incubating them in a glass bead sterilizer. If sterilizing tools in a hot bead sterilizer, spray surgical items with 70% ethanol, and once the tools are dry, insert the working tip of the tools into the pool of hot beads. Once the beads reach 233°C (464°F) (indicated by a green light), incubate tools for at least 20 seconds, wait for items to cool down, and then lay them out in a sterile glass Petri-dish such that they can be easily accessed during the surgery.</div>

<ol start="5">
<li>Place the metal plate on the warming pad and position the metal plate such that it can be easily viewed through the microscope (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A).</li>

<li>Transfer the mouse to the surgical area and place it on the window of the metal plate such that the underside of the mouse is exposed to the heating pad, then prepare the mouse for surgery.
<ol type="a">
<li>Tape the forelimbs to the metal plate (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A).
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Take care not to tape the whiskers while taping the mouse.</div>

<li>Place a 3 mL syringe or a similarly sized wedge under the lower neck/upper back (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This will help lift the upper back of the mouse, providing easier access to the cervical spinal cord during surgery.</div>
</li>
<li>Finally, tape the hindlegs and the tail at two points as shown in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A such that the mouse remains taut along the rostro-caudal axis throughout the procedure (<a href="#sec6.1">Troubleshooting 1</a>).
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Ensure that the mouse is not pressed against the plate too tightly, which might otherwise lead to death or respiratory distress.</div>
</li>
<li>Once the mouse has been satisfactorily positioned, apply eye lubricant on both eyes to prevent drying of the eyes during surgery.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Sterilize the surgical site by swabbing the skin with three alternating rubs of povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol.</li>
<li>Using a scalpel, make a 2 cm long incision starting at the base of the head and extending through the midline of the back (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). Slide a pair of blunt forceps under the rostral margin of the incision and use the retractor at the mouse’s head to retract the skin. Using the other retractors on the sides, retract the skin along the caudal margin on either side to create a triangular surgical window (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D).</li>
<li>In the exposed tissue, locate the margin (along the mediolateral axis) between the rostrally located trapezius muscle and the caudally located, lighter coloured adipose tissue. Using micro scissors, gently cut any fascia that might hold these two pieces of tissue along this margin. Adjust the rostrally placed retractor to tuck away the musculature, and similarly, adjust the other two retractors to tuck away the adipose tissue.</li>
<li>Locate the prominent, long spinous process of the second thoracic vertebra (T2 vertebra), which protrudes dorsally from the spinal cord (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>E). Using micro scissors, snip the muscles that are attached rostrally to this vertebra. Gently slide the micro scissors underneath the rostrally located musculature and cut it along the midline to detach it from the underlying cervical vertebrae. Use two new retractors, one on either side of the mouse, to retract the midline muscles (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>F).</li>
<li>Use the spinous process of the second thoracic vertebra (T2) as a landmark and count up from T2 to locate the appropriate cervical segments for injection (<a href="#bib18">Harrison et al., 2013</a>).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The number and identity of segments to be injected depend on the research question. Typically, to target neurons in the lower cervical regions, spinal segments between C5-C6, C6-C7, and C7-C8 vertebrae can be injected (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>F).</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Using an absorption triangle, gently swab the exposed vertebrae and remove any residual tissue so as to obtain a clear view of the spinal cord segments.</li>
<li>To facilitate smooth entry of the micropipette into the spinal cord, puncture the meninges using a fine-tipped forceps (preferably Dumont #5SF Forceps) and peel it away (<a href="#sec6.3">Troubleshooting 2</a>) (<a href="#mmc7">Methods video S6</a>).</li>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15–25 min</div>
<p>Here we describe how to perform intraspinal injections.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>After the relevant spinal cord segments have been exposed, transfer the mouse along with the metal plate to the stereotaxic stage.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Take care not to disturb the mouse or the retractors, which may otherwise impede clear view of the cervical segments.

<ol start="15">
<li>Adjust the metal plate containing the mouse and the arms of the stereotaxic manipulator such that the micropipette tip is positioned directly above the surface of the first spinal segment to be injected. The micropipette should be 400–600 μm away from the midline.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The midline along the rostro-caudal axis can be identified by the blood vessel that runs along the length of the spinal cord.</div>
<ol start="16">
<li>Set the total volume and rate of release of viral particles on the syringe pump. Typically, 250 nl of the solution containing viral particles is injected in each of the cervical segments, while 300 nl is injected in each of the lumbar segments at a rate of 75–100 nl per minute.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Before performing the injections, run the program till a tiny drop of the viral solution can be seen forming at the tip of the micropipette to ensure that the micropipette is not blocked by any debris that might impede solution flow.</div>
<ol start="17">
<li>Use the axis manipulators on the stereotaxic injector to gently lower the micropipette (<a href="#mmc9">Methods video S8</a>) so that it just about touches the surface of the spinal cord, and then tare the reading for the dorso-ventral coordinate.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Taring the dorso-ventral coordinate is crucial since it enables accurate measurement of the depth of the micropipette tip while performing the injections.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If using an injector that does not digitally display the coordinates, note the start position of the rotating wheel and refer to manufacturer instructions to determine the number of rotations of the wheel that is required to advance the syringe by a millimeter. Typically, one rotation of the wheel should advance the syringe by a millimeter.</div>
<ol start="18">
<li>To infect neurons in the dorsal laminae of the spinal cord, gently lower the micropipette to a depth of 500 μm and pull back 200 μm, so that micropipette tip settles at ∼ 300 μm from the dorsal surface. To infect neurons in the ventral laminae of the spinal cord, gently lower the micropipette to a depth of 800–1000 μm and withdraw 200 μm, so that the micropipette tip settles at a depth of ∼600–800 μm from the dorsal surface (<a href="#sec6.5">Troubleshooting 3</a>).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> After a segment has been injected, wait one minute before pulling the micropipette out to ensure that the viral solution is efficiently absorbed by the tissue and does not leak out. Additionally, before proceeding to inject the next segment, run the program till a small drop of virus solution can be seen pooling at the tip (<a href="#sec6.7">Troubleshooting 4</a>).</div>
<ol start="19">
<li>Repeat the preceding two steps to inject the remaining segments.</li>
<li>Once the mouse is injected, move the metal plate containing the mouse to a flat surface. Wait for bleeding, if any, to stop. Gently remove the retractors holding the muscles and then suture the midline muscles using a 6-0 absorbable suture (<a href="#mmc10">Methods video S9</a>).</li>

</ol>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> The cage containing the mouse can be placed in a temperature-controlled incubator for a few hours before being returned to the holding cage rack.

<ol start="26">
<li>Place a few food pellets on the floor of the cage for a day, so that the mice can easily access the food.</li>
<li>Administer analgesics (Meloxicam) for two days following surgery using a 1mL syringe with a 26-gauge needle (please refer to <a href="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/972-Mmc1.pdf">Table S1</a> for calculating the concentration and volume of meloxicam). While handling mice for injecting analgesics, avoid scruffing the mouse as this may not only be painful for the mouse, but also irritate the wound and disturb the staples or sutures. Instead, gently place the mouse on the steel food rack and lift the base of the mouse away from the rack floor by lifting the tail to gain access to the intraperitoneal space and then swiftly inject the mouse (<a href="#mmc11">Methods video S10</a>).</li>
<li>The day after the surgery, monitor mice for any signs of spinal damage, including partial or complete paralysis in one or more limbs after surgery. While relatively uncommon (∼ &lt; 5% of mice injected), varying degrees of paralysis might result from damage to the spinal cord during surgery depending on the extent and location of the injury on the spinal cord. Euthanize mice displaying paralysis to prevent further distress to the mice.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Some advantages of the technique we present over other methods of intraspinal injections are that: (a) laminectomies are avoided, making it less invasive; (b) the use of injectable anesthesia rather than isoflurane circumvents the need for a nose-cone, which allows greater flexibility in the handling and positioning of the animal during surgery; (c) the spinal cord does not have to be clamped during surgery, which makes it less technically-challenging and helps save time; (d) the use of quartz glass micropipettes for cervical surgeries enables easy penetration of the cervical segments.</p>
<p>Three weeks following intraspinal delivery of adeno-associated viruses expressing fluorescent reporters, reporter expression should be seen in the side of the spinal cord that was injected and along the rostro-caudal axis of the spinal cord spanning the spinal segments that were injected. To determine the efficacy of viral injection, we harvested the spinal cord (<a href="#bib20">Kennedy et al., 2011</a>) from spinal-injected mice (following cardiac perfusion with 10 mL of PBS followed by 10 mL of 4% PFA), post-fixed cords by incubating cords in 4% PFA for one hour, cryo-protected cords by incubating in 30% sucrose overnight, embedded cords in OCT medium (cryo-embedding compound), cut transverse sections (50 μm thickness) of the spinal cord and assessed every 10<sup>th</sup> section (∼ at 500 μm intervals) for reporter expression. Typically, reporter expression should be confined to the side of the spinal cord that was injected (for unilateral injections) (<a href="#fig7">Figures 7</a>A and 7B) or be present on both sides (for bilateral expression) and gradually taper off in the spinal segments flanking the injection sites. (<a href="#sec6.9">Troubleshooting 5</a>)</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>An inherent limitation of intraspinal injections is that muscles overlying the cervical and lumbar segments will need to be cut. Since this may affect behavior, ensure that control mice are similarly operated upon and injected. Since cuts will take time to heal, allow 3–4 weeks between surgery and behavior experiments. Another limitation of spinal injections is that while neurons in the dorsal and ventral sections of the spinal cord can be differentially targeted, it remains difficult to exclusively target neurons in a specific lamina.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The mouse suffers from respiratory distress during cervical surgery. (Part 1, Step 1, (c))</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is likely that the mouse is pressed too firmly against the plate. In this case, adjust the tapes so that there is enough slack.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Excessive hemorrhaging during cervical and lumbar surgeries. (Parts 2 &amp; 3)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Bleeding should be minimal, if at all, during cervical injections since very few major blood vessels run through the muscles that overlie the cervical segments. Ensure that no muscles are cut apart from the ones mentioned in the steps. On the other hand, bleeding is common in lumbar surgeries. To minimize hemorrhaging, take care not to cut any blood vessels running along the midline of the spinal cord. Additionally, ensure that the retractors are not pulling hard on the tissue.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Bending of the glass micropipette while attempting to inject the spinal cord. (Part 3, Step 18)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The presence of meninges overlying the spinal cord may provide resistance to the insertion of the micropipette tip and may result in the bending or breaking of the micropipette tip. This typically happens more often during cervical than lumbar injections, because the dura and white matter in the dorsal surface is thicker in the cervical compared to lumbar segments (<a href="#bib36">Yang et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib21">Kwon et al., 2018</a>). Tip breaking incidents can be reduced by using capillary tubes made of quartz instead of borosilicate to make micropipettes, and by using a micropipette whose tip is beveled and sharp. Additionally, ensure that the meninges have been completely removed during surgery before proceeding to injections.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Solution does not flow through the micropipette. (Part 3, Step 18)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The presence of air bubbles or residual debris from previous injections could impede the flow of the contents of the syringe. Before performing the injections, ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe. If there are air bubbles towards the tip of the micropipette, hold the syringe with the micropipette tip facing up and allow the bubbles to rise and then expel the bubbles. If there appears to be any debris, insert the needle in an Eppendorf tube containing saline and expel a few microliters into the saline. Alternatively, increase the flow rate of the syringe pump to 1000–2000 nl/min and stop as soon as a drop of solution pools at the micropipette tip and then run the program as usual (75–100 nl/min).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Expression of the virus after injection might be unsatisfactory. (<a href="#expected-outcomes">expected outcomes</a>)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Typically, we inject viruses at a concentration of 1–5 <b>×</b> 10<sup>12</sup> genome copies/mL. If reporter expression is weak and/or is present in fewer cells than expected, test 3 different titers between 5–20 <b>×</b> 10<sup>12</sup> genome copies/mL to determine the optimal titer. Since repeated freeze-thaw cycles might lower the transduction efficiency of the virus, aliquot viruses in small volumes (1 ul per PCR tube) and discard any virus solution that remains after injections. Another possibility is that in some cases, fluorescent reporter expression could be weak, and so, spinal cord sections may need to be immuno-stained with antibodies against the fluorescent protein to be able to visualize reporter expression.</p>
