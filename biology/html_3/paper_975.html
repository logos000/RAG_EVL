<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The pathogen <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> differentiates from epimastigotes (E) into infective metacyclic trypomastigotes (MTs) to invade the mammalian cell. This process, called metacyclogenesis, is mimicked in vitro by nutrient starvation or incubation with minimal media. Here, we describe an alternative protocol for metacyclogenesis by incubating E forms in a biphasic medium supplemented with human blood. Although time consuming, this procedure yields fully differentiated MTs without the presence of intermediate forms, even for cultures that have been maintained as E for years.</p>

<p>The protocol presented here describes the steps to differentiate E forms into MT using the Y strain of <i>T. cruzi</i>, typified as a <u>D</u>iscrete <u>T</u>yping <u>U</u>nit II, DTUII (<a href="#bib9">Zingales et al., 2009</a>). However, we have success to differentiate E forms from a <i>T. cruzi</i> strain belonging to the DTUI lineage.</p>
<p>The <i>in vitro</i> metacyclogenesis procedure was performed in presence of Geneticin, using genetically modified E forms harboring an empty pTREX expression vector, which confers resistance to this antibiotic (<a href="#bib8">Vazquez and Levin, 1999</a>). Hence, this method may be useful to differentiate E forms overexpressing different proteins under study which requires this antibiotic as a selectable marker.</p>
<p>The procedure detailed in this protocol consists on the incubation of E forms at 28°C in a biphasic medium based on blood-agar slants modified from <a href="#bib5">Neal and Miles, 1963</a>. The preparation of both solid and liquid components of the biphasic medium, as well as the starting E culture, is depicted in this section.</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Along the incubation on biphasic medium, the metacyclogenesis rate increases over time until it reaches a maximum.

<p>MT can be isolated from non-differentiated E forms for downstream applications, such as cell invasion assays or further differentiation to axenic amastigotes (the <i>in vitro</i> representative form of the <i>T. cruzi</i> intracellular amastigote). This can be achieved by the clearance of the remaining E forms in the differentiated culture by complement-mediated parasite lysis, following the steps detailed here. E forms are highly susceptible to complement mediated-lysis, meanwhile MT are resistant (<a href="#bib4">Lidani et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Upon the completion of this protocol, viable, fully differentiated MT forms ready for downstream applications should be obtained (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Typically, following the detailed steps for <i>T. cruzi</i> Y strain belonging to the DTUII lineage, we have obtained 5<b>×</b>10<sup>6</sup> MT from an initial 2<b>×</b>10<sup>6</sup> E forms placed onto biphasic medium at day 1. The highest metacyclogenesis rate incubating these parasites in the blood-agar medium was achieved at day 16, when ∼ 40% of parasites differentiated into the MT forms (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). This resulted in an improvement of the differentiation yield in comparison with the very low percentage of MT forms obtained for this strain using the <u>T</u>riatomine <u>A</u>rtificial <u>U</u>rine (TAU) medium (<a href="#bib2">Contreras et al., 1985</a>). Also, the blood-agar method was suitable to obtain MT forms from E isolates that exhibit low infectivity or that have been cultivated <i>in vitro</i> for long periods. The impaired <i>in vitro</i> metacyclogenesis is a common feature for those isolates that have been cultivated repeatedly as E forms without any passage through mammalian cells or experimental infection (<a href="#bib1">Contreras et al., 1998</a>). However, following the blood-agar method, up to 18% of E forms culture from the <i>T. cruzi</i> strain typified as DTUI was differentiated into MT forms (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). This strain exhibits low infectivity; it has been maintained as E stage for years in our laboratory and does not differentiate into MT forms by incubating them in chemically defined media, such as TAU or Grace's Insect Tissue Culture medium (<a href="#bib7">Sullivan, 1982</a>).</p>

<p>In the A panel, MT and lysed E fixed for 10 min with ice-cold methanol, were subjected to Giemsa staining (0.1% w/v in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS, pH 6.8) and observed at the optical microscope. Giemsa staining revealed the presence of an undulating membrane and a flagellum attached to the cell body; being both characteristic of trypomastigote morphology (left panel). In the B panel, a representative immunofluorescence microscopy is shown, which was performed placing MT forms onto poly-lysine microscope slides, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and washed twice with PBS. After blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA), slides were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-PFR antibody (diluted 1:2 in 1% PBS-BSA) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 in 1% PBS-BSA) to reveal the flagellum; both incubations were carried out for 1 h each at 20°C–24°C. Slides were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes), containing 10 μg/mL of DAPI for nuclei and kinetoplast staining. This staining revealed the position of the flagellum in more detail, which emerges near the posterior end of the parasite and edgings the cell body. The staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) also showed the position and morphology of DNA-containing structures: a rounded mitochondrial DNA (the kinetoplast) located posterior to the elongated, and the nuclear DNA positioned at the central portion of the cell. Cells were observed in an Olympus BX-61 fluorescence microscope.

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The protocol described here was the solution we find in our lab to obtain fully differentiated MT forms from a <i>T. cruzi</i> strain which has very low metacyclogenesis rate using the TAU method (less than 8%) and no metacyclogenesis at all by incubation with Grace Medium. However, one limitation of the method presented here is that is time-consuming, because the incubation times for metacyclogenesis takes at least more than two weeks, in comparison with the 72–96 h of incubation used in TAU or Grace medium (albeit the latter two are strain-dependent). Finally, as this method does not produce partially differentiated parasites, it is not suitable for those studies focused on the characterization of E to MT intermediate forms.</p>

<p>Early solidification of the blood-agar medium when it is still contained in the bottle, while it is being dispensing into the centrifuge tubes or before they are placed slanted (step 1.e-f at <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This may be a common problem when a large number of agar-slanted tubes are being prepared. If blood-agar medium starts to solidify early than desired, it will interfere with the correct formation of the agar slant, generating irregular and/or dissimilar slant surface areas among tubes. To avoid this, a potential solution is to keep several bottles, each containing unsolidified blood-agar volume just enough to prepare a limited number of tubes (e.g., 10) in the water bath at 40°C. Place each bottle in the sterility hood for dispensing by one, keeping the rest of the medium above de solidification temperature in the water bath. Once the dispensing of the first set of tubes is finished, continue with another bottle and so on, until the required number of slants is obtained.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Epimastigote forms do not differentiate into metacyclic trypomastigote after two weeks of incubation in biphasic medium (step 5).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Continue with the incubation of parasites in the biphasic medium for longer periods, checking the presence of differentiated MT each 24–48 h. Depending on the <i>T. cruzi</i> strain and culture conditions, metacyclogenesis may require longer incubation times on the biphasic medium. Regarding this and as an example, the metacyclogenesis of E forms from the <i>T. cruzi</i> strain belonging to DTUI lineage usually takes twice the incubation time in the biphasic medium as for the Y strain (DTUII) (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Small blood-agar pieces detach from the slant into the liquid medium when transferring the differentiated culture for downstream applications (steps 6 and7).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Transfer the culture containing parasites together with the small pieces of blood-agar to a new conical tube. Centrifuge at 200 <b>×</b> <i>g</i> for 5 min. Transfer the supernatant carefully into a new conical tube containing intact blood-agar slant and continue with the isolation of MT forms.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>E forms are not completely lysed by the treatment of non-heat inactivated BFS, even with an additional incubation of 15 min (steps 10–11).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use a different batch of FBS or change the sera supplier. Some FBS exhibit week complement activity, even being non-heat inactivated, due to a minor and/or undeclared irradiation treatment.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>MT forms contaminated with cellular debris after 3 h of incubation at 37°C (steps 16 and 17).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Repeat step 15 centrifuging mixture at 3000 g for longer times (30 min). Then incubate the pelleted MT forms and cell debris at 37°C 6–12 h. This will allow the motile MT forms swim back again to the supernatant. Continue with the protocol.</p>
