<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Since the discovery of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), numerous strategies have been established to efficiently derive cardiomyocytes from hiPSCs (hiPSC-CMs). Here, we describe a cost-effective strategy for the subsequent massive expansion (&gt;250-fold) of high-purity hiPSC-CMs relying on two aspects: removal of cell-cell contacts and small-molecule inhibition with CHIR99021. The protocol maintains CM functionality, allows cryopreservation, and the cells can be used in downstream assays such as disease modeling, drug and toxicity screening, and cell therapy.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib1">Buikema (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>In a sterile hood, dilute Matrigel to a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL in 4°C RPMI-1640 in a 50-mL tube on ice. Prepare aliquots of 1 mL in 15-mL tubes on ice and store at −20°C. Remove one Matrigel aliquot (1 mL) from the freezer, and add 11 mL of cold RPMI-1640 to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL (empirically up to 5× lower concentrations of Matrigel are working). Gently mix the Matrigel solution to thaw and dissolve the Matrigel. Immediately add 1 mL/well Matrigel in RPMI-1640 for 6-well plates, 1.5 mL/flask for T25, 2.5 mL/flask for T75, or 5 mL/flask for T175 flasks. Allow the Matrigel to set for 30 min at 37°C before use. The Matrigel-coated plates and flasks can be stored at 4°C for up to 3 weeks.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Keep Matrigel on ice to avoid solidification during the coating procedure. Boxes with pipet tips can be pre-chilled at −20°C.</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min</div>
<p>The hiPSCs are maintained under feeder-free conditions with daily medium changes and kept at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub>. When 80%–90% confluent, the hiPSC can be passaged (usually about 3 to 4 days after passaging).</p>
<ol>
<li>Prewarm E8 medium, EDTA Dissociation Buffer, and Matrigel-coated plates to 20°C–25°C.</li>
<li>Aspirate the medium, and add 1 mL 0.5 mM EDTA/PBS to each well. At this point, 2.5 to 3 million cells should be present in each well of the 6-well culture plate.</li>
<li>Incubate the plate for 3–5 min.</li>
<li>Aspirate the EDTA and flush the hiPSC with a 1 mL tip filled with 1 mL E8 + 5 μM Y27632, dispense the medium over the surface of the plate well until all the cells are detached and gently mix 2–5 times using the 1 mL tip.</li>
<li>Add the required cell amount from the 1 mL cell suspension into each well of a Matrigel-coated plate containing 2 mL E8 + 5 μM Y27632 (split ratio of 1:13 is performed here).</li>
<li>Place the plate in the incubator and make side-to-side movements to equally disperse the cells in every well.</li>
<li>Prewarm hiPSC E8 Medium to 20°C–25°C.</li>
<li>Each day aspirate the medium and add 2 mL of fresh prewarmed hiPSC E8 complete medium per well.</li>
<li>When the hiPSCs are 80%–90% confluent they are ready to start the differentiation. At this point, equal dispersed hiPSC colonies should be present in each well.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The starting seeding cell density is very critical for an efficient cardiac differentiation. The initial plating density and/or the time of expansion prior to initiation of differentiation may require optimization for different cell lines or expansion conditions. We recommend plating at a 1:10–1:20 splitting ratio with a cell density of 80%–90% within 3–4 days.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Karyotyping of the hiPSC lines is advised. Thereafter, hiPSC can be safely passaged for 20 times before another karyotyping is advised. Passaging over 40 times could lead in spontaneous differentiation of the hiPSC lines, resulting in inefficient differentiations.</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min per day</div>
<p>The cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs can be successfully performed by the steps described below. The cultures of cardiomyocytes typically contract by day 8–9 of differentiation before starting the expansion on day 11 (see <a href="#mmc1">Methods Video S1</a>).</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Day 0: Prepare 3 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM differentiation medium with the appropriate concentration of CHIR per hiPSC line. Aspire the E8 medium and replace carefully with 3 mL/well with the prepared differentiation medium. For every differentiation apply two concentrations of CHIR for an optimal window concentration per differentiation per plate.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Do not re-freeze and thaw the CHIR aliquots since this molecule is unstable after thawing and freezing.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Other differentiation protocols can be used to generate hiPSC-CMs before the expansion. Here, we have used the B27 (<a href="#bib3">Lian, 2012</a>), Heparin (<a href="#bib4">Lin, 2017</a>), and CDM3 (<a href="#bib2">Burridge, 2014</a>) medium, which were all sufficient for the massive expansion of hiPSC-CMs.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Though we identified 7 and 8 μM CHIR in the B27 protocol as the optimal concentration for the three lines that we tested, other lines may respond to CHIR treatment differently. We recommend testing concentrations of 2–8 μM of CHIR in heparin or CDM3 medium and 5–10 μM of CHIR in B27 medium differentiations.</div>
<ol start="11">
<li>Day 1: On top of the original medium, carefully add 2 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM differentiation medium. Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub> incubator.</li>
<li>Day 2: On top of the original medium, carefully add 1 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM differentiation medium. Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub> incubator.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Here we use the addition of medium on day 1 and day 2 to the original medium of step 10. This protocol is effective to gradual decrease the CHIR concentration, mimicking the first steps of embryonic heart development. However, other differentiation protocols such as 2 days of CHIR medium is also possible to generate hiPSC-CMs for the CM expansion.</div>
<ol start="13">
<li>Day 3: Aspirate the old medium and carefully add 3 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM differentiation medium with 2 μM Wnt-C59 to each well of the 6-well plate. Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub> incubator.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> During differentiation, the cell death rate is high. Remove dead cell debris as much as possible by shaking and aspirating the medium completely.</div>

<li>Day 7: Aspirate the medium and carefully add 3 mL/well of 37°C-preheated CM culture medium. Put the plate back into the 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 21% O<sub>2</sub> incubator. Robust spontaneous contraction should occur by day 8–9.</li>

<p>Replating of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by enzymatic digestion can be performed in order to plate cells into desired culture vessel formats at defined cell numbers if required (e.g., in lower cell density for the maximum expansion capacity; <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). Between day 10 and day 14 the hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes can be used for most successful cardiac expansion. Here, we use monolayers with spontaneous contracting cells on day 11 (<a href="#mmc1">Methods Video S1</a>). From a 6 well plate format, select the most optimal well(s) by microscopic observe the amount of beating cardiomyocytes.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The efficient expansion of functional CMs (up to a 250-fold increase of CM number within 3–5 weeks) can be obtained from multiple hiPSC lines. For the method described here, hiPSC-CMs derived from three different differentiation protocols were all suitable for expansion in cardiac expansion medium, although the expansion capacity of the hiPSC-CMs differentiated using the B27 differentiation protocol appears to be the most robust (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>Before starting the expansion steps, hiPSC-CMs microscopically should have high amounts of beating areas by day 8–9 and should be used between day 11 and day 14 of differentiation (<a href="#mmc1">Methods Video S1</a>). After low cell density replating of hiPSC-CMs in culture flasks, addition CHIR to the cardiac culture medium efficiently induces hiPSC-CM proliferation and subsequent passaging (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). After 3–5 days of expansion, the hiPSC-CMs will reach a near confluent monolayer. <a href="#mmc2">Methods Videos S2</a> and <a href="#mmc3">S3</a> show the required steps and expected morphology of the hiPSC-CMs during expansion.</p>
<p>The cryopreservation steps allow for biobanking of large batches of hiPSC-CMs that can be stored before expansion or after passage 1 or 2. Thawing of cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs is efficient (74% viable hiPSC-CMs), and during subsequent expansion hiPSC-CMs exhibit a similar growth curve when compared to fresh unfrozen hiPSC-CMs (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). After passage 2, we do not recommend to biobank the expanding hiPSC-CMs due to lower viability upon recovery.</p>
<p>In a successful differentiation batch the expression of cardiac sarcomere protein α-actinin is usually more than 80%, and expanding cells should remain α-actinin positive during subsequent passaging. Upon CHIR optimization, up to 37% of the hiPSC-CMs will be positive for proliferative cell marker Ki67 (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Despite high hiPSC-CM differentiation efficiency (85%–99%) in 2D monolayer cultures (85%–99%), yet, batch-to-batch and cell line-to-line variability remains an issue for stable CM production. In our protocol, we provide the possibility to robustly expand and/or further purify hiPSC-CM cultures via serial passaging and cell contact inhibition. This ultimately allows for a 250 fold expansion of day 11 hiPSC-CMs. However, we have noticed that also cell line-to-line and batch-to-batch variabilities exist. Moreover, the expansion capacity decreases when cells are passaged multiple times.</p>
<p>Another limitation of our method is that hiPSC-CMs differentiation should be at least 50% (Flow cytometry positive for α-actinin) to induce an efficient proliferative response at day 11. One explanation for the absence of massive proliferation of unpure hiPSC-CM cultures would be cell-cycle inhibiting paracrine signaling factors secreted by the other cell types. Alternatively, in low efficiency cultures (&lt;50%) the CM are phenotypically different from efficiently differentiated hiPSC-CMs (&gt;70%). Lastly, when it comes to cryopreservation of hiPSC-CMs the cell viability after thawing reduces from P1 to P5 (70% to 28%), which was similar to the non-expanded age-matched CMs. Therefore, cryopreservation hiPSC-CMs is recommended up to passage 2. HiPSC-CMs exceeding passage 2 are suitable for the use in direct downstream assays.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>There are many dead hiPSC after passaging, is this normal?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The hiPSCs need to be monitored under a microscope and adequate timing of the chemical digestion process of dissociation remains essential for cell survival. Generally, when light sheds through the colonies and the hiPSCs can be easily flushed off the plate, the dissociation is sufficient. Use 0.5 mM EDTA solution and 10 μM Y27632 in the E8 complete medium are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The hiPSC colonies are too dense in the middle, is this a problem?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The hiPSCs need to be equally divided over the wells to enable full monolayer differentiation with high efficiencies. Mechanically dissociate the detached hiPSC 5–10 times till the clumps are only 3–5 cells big. Move plate more times side-to-side in the incubator and leave cells for 24 h.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The hiPSCs look abnormal or the proliferation speed is slow.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Wait for some passages before starting cardiac differentiation. Perform mycoplasma test and karyotyping to rule out any hiPSC cell line abnormalities.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>No spontaneous contraction on day 11.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>See solutions concerning problems during the cultivation of hiPSCs. Optimize the CHIR concentrations from 5–10 μM per hiPSC line. Do not re-freeze CHIR aliquots.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Many dead hiPSC-CMs are present upon thawing, is this normal?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We observe a cell viability between 60%–90% upon thawing by using CMs on passage 1–2. Pipette cells carefully with a 5 mL pipette. Place the thawed cells directly into the replating medium. Add 1:100 Revitacell to promote cell survival and 10% KO serum can be added to promote cell survival after thawing.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>No hiPSC-CMs are attached to the culture flask after replating.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Allow the Matrigel to incubate at 37°C for at least 1 h. Check culture flask on complete coating coverage. Pipette cells carefully with a 5-mL pipette. Add 1:100 Revitacell to promote cell survival. Add 10% KO serum to promote cell survival. Seed cell number as described in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>Pipette carefully with 5-mL pipette, add Revitacell to promote cell survival, add 10% KO serum to promote cell survival, decrease CHIR concentration, seed cell number as described in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.15">Problem 8</h3>
<p>HiPSC-CMs capacity is lower than expected.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.16">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Optimize the CHIR concentration and add the CHIR every other day. Do not re-freeze CHIR aliquots. Use a lower splitting ratio in the first 3 passages (1:20–1:5) and increase the splitting ratio upon passage 3 and passage 4 to 1:2. Do not split after passage 4. Only use differentiated cell populations with ≥70% α-actinin-positive cells.</p>
