<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Ketohexokinase (KHK) catalyzes the first step of fructose metabolism. Inhibitors of KHK enzymatic activity are being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetes. Here, we present a luminescence-based protocol to quantify KHK activity. The accuracy of this technique has been validated using knockdown and overexpression of KHK <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. The specificity of the assay has been verified using 3-O-methyl-D-fructose, a non-metabolizable analog of fructose, heat inactivation of hexokinases, and depletion of potassium.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib16">Damen et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Ketohexokinase activity is resistant to temperature degradation (<a href="#bib9">Malaisse et al., 1989</a>). Hexokinases are degraded at 70°C, therefore, heat can be used to discern between closely related hexokinase and KHK-C activity.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> KHK-C activity requires potassium (<a href="#bib10">Sener et al., 1984</a>), whereas FN3K activity is not known to require this cation (<a href="#bib15">Szwergold et al., 2001</a>). It is critical that K<sup>+</sup> is used in the reaction mixture and not other cations, such as Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Basic principle</h3>
<p>Consumption of a high-fat diet and sugar-sweetened beverages predisposes to development of obesity, insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<a href="#bib11">Softic et al., 2016</a>)(<a href="#bib14">Softic et al., 2020</a>). Fructose, a component of dietary sugar, has been implicated and targeted against these complications (<a href="#bib1">Attia et al., 2020</a>). However, a reliable protocol to accurately measure fructose metabolism was not available.</p>
<p>Ketohexokinase (KHK) catalyzes the first step of fructose metabolism by phosphorylating fructose to fructose 1-phosphate. There are two KHK isoforms, (<a href="#bib4">Diggle et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib5">Diggle et al., 2010</a>). KHK-C is expressed in the liver, kidney and the intestine and is the primary enzyme catalyzing fructose metabolism. KHK-A is expressed ubiquitously, but it has much lower affinity for fructose. Hexokinase 1 (HK1), expressed in the pancreas and the brain and hexokinase 2 (HK2), expressed in the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, can also metabolize fructose by converting it to fructose 6-phosphate (<a href="#bib7">Helsley et al., 2020</a>). Lastly, fructosamine 3 kinase (FN3K), expressed in red blood cells and the lens of the eye, can phosphorylate fructose to fructose 3-phosphate (<a href="#bib7">Helsley et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>A unique feature of KHK-C activity is that phosphorylation of fructose occurs exceedingly fast leading to depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and accumulation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). On the other hand, phosphorylation of glucose does not increase ADP levels. We have explored this unique feature of KHK-C to approximate its enzymatic activity based on measuring ADP accumulation. In brief, the samples are mixed with fructose, ATP and potassium and ADP accumulation is quantified using luminescent ADP detection assay.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Our protocol provides an experimental method to measure ketohexokinase activity of the recombinant human KHK-C protein and endogenous KHK-C in cell lysates or tissue homogenates. First, we measured KHK-C activity of the recombinant human protein. As expected, KHK-C activity increased with longer incubation time up to 60 min (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A). Increasing concentrations of human recombinant KHK-C protein up to 16 nM, increased corresponding luminescence readings, indicating higher ADP production and thus greater KHK-C activity (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A). Next, we measured KHK-C reaction linearity using increasing KHK-C protein concentrations with fixed incubation time. KHK-C concentration of less than 4 nM exhibited near perfect linear increase in the enzymatic activity over time (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). Additionally, we measured the signal stability from 45 up to 240 min after adding ADP-Glo detection reagent. For concentrations of KHK less than 4 nM, the assay signal reached stable level after 90 min of incubation and remained stable for four hours (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C). In summary, reaction incubation time of 60 min and KHK-C protein concentrations of less than 4 nM give the most reliable measurement of KHK-C activity, which remained stable for four hours.</p>

<p>Using the knowledge gained utilizing recombinant human KHK-C protein we determined KHK-C activity in cultured hepatocytes. We have previously reported that immortalized cultured hepatocytes do not express KHK-C and that primary hepatocytes quickly lose KHK-C expression in culture (<a href="#bib13">Softic et al., 2019</a>). This is in agreement with reports indicating that KHK-C is expressed in fully differentiated hepatocytes but not in fetal liver or cancer cells (<a href="#bib8">Li et al., 2016</a>). Thus, we overexpressed (OE) KHK-C in human cultured hepatocytes, HepG2 cells (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A). Since wild type HepG2 cells completely lack this enzyme, KHK OE hepatocytes had a 1500-fold increase in KHK. However, KHK level in OE cell was similar to that found in liver homogenates (data not shown). Lysates from wild type (WT) and KHK-C OE hepatocytes were added to the substrate solution containing no fructose, 2 mM of fructose or 2 mM of 3-<i>O</i>-methyl-<span class="small-caps">d</span>-fructose (3OMF), a non-metabolizable analog of fructose (<a href="#bib3">Csaky and Fischer, 1984</a>). KHK-C activity was not increased significantly in WT HepG2 hepatocytes when treated with fructose or 3OMF, compared to the controls (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B). On the other hand, KHK-C activity increased significantly in KHK-C OE hepatocytes treated with fructose, but not with 3OMF. Thus, KHK-C activity was increased only in the cells that possess KHK-C and were treated with fructose as a substrate, indicating that our protocol can reliably measure fructose metabolism via KHK-C.</p>

</figure>
<p>Next, we quantified hepatic KHK-C activity in liver homogenates. Based on the optimal concentration (4 nM or 0.27 ng/uL) of recombinant human KHK-C and some reports indicating that KHK expression in the liver is as high as one percent of the total liver proteome, we prepared 0.025 ug/uL liver lysate concentration. Livers were harvested from mice fed low fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD). Mice on HFD were also injected with either AAV to overexpress KHK-C or KHK siRNA to knockdown this protein in the liver. Mice on a HFD did not show a statistically significant increase in KHK-C protein as compared to the mice fed LFD (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C). Mice on HFD treated with AAV had a three-fold increase in KHK-C protein, whereas KHK siRNA treatment almost completely abrogated KHK protein in the liver (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C), in agreement with our previous work (<a href="#bib12">Softic et al., 2017</a>). KHK-C activity was significantly higher in mice on HFD as compared to the mice on LFD (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D). On HFD, OE of KHK-C resulted in doubling of KHK-C activity, whereas KD of KHK decreased KHK activity by 63%. Interestingly, fructose metabolism was not zero in the livers of mice treated with KHK siRNA, suggesting the presence of additional fructose metabolizing enzymes.</p>
<p>To ensure that the assay is specific for fructose metabolism, we performed several validating experiments. First, we measured ADP production with or without addition of fructose in liver homogenates from the mice on a LFD, HFD and HFD treated with KHK siRNA (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A). All three samples that did not contain fructose had basal ADP production of about 2000 mM per ng of protein per minute. This represents KHK-independent ADP production and this baseline should be subtracted from the total activity of the samples that do contain fructose. Next, we determined ADP production from the enzymes that are heat stable versus heat liable. This was done in liver homogenates from the mice on a HFD treated with and without KHK siRNA, and in adipose tissue, which is known to metabolize fructose via hexokinase 2. In the livers of control mice, there was no significant difference in ADP production in samples that were heated to 70°C for five minutes and the samples that were not heat treated (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B). This indicates that most fructose metabolism in the liver occurs via heat stable KHK-C. Mice treated with KHK siRNA had much lower ADP production and this value was further decreased in heated samples. This decrease likely reflects fructose metabolism via hexokinase in KHK siRNA treated livers. Indeed, ADP production in adipose tissue was similar to that from KHK KD livers, and it also decreased following heat treatment. These data indicate that fructose metabolism in adipose tissue and in liver following KHK KD occurs, in part, via heat liable hexokinases.</p>

<p>KHK-C requires potassium for its enzymatic activity and indeed decreasing concentration of potassium in the enzymatic reaction profoundly decreased ADP production (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C). ADP production is also decreased with decreasing potassium concentrations in the livers of the mice treated with KHK siRNA. Only minimal ADP production was observed in samples that do not contain any potassium, indicating that the contribution of FN3K and other potassium-independent enzymes is minimal in the liver. Since ADP production was profoundly affected by potassium concentrations we further tested how electrolyte composition may affect enzymatic activity of recombinant human KHK-C protein. Indeed, we confirmed that potassium is required for optimal KHK-C activity. Different buffers had minimal effects on KHK-C activity, while Hepes buffer gave the highest reading (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D).</p>
<p>In summary, utilizing this protocol we can accurately and specifically measure fructose metabolism via KHK-C.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Many enzymes utilize ATP and generate ADP to harvest energy for their enzymatic activity. This assay is based on approximating KHK-C activity by measuring ADP accumulation, thus a vast array of enzymes could theoretically confound our results. A reaction mixture not containing fructose or containing 3OMF should be used to subtract background ADP accumulation from the enzymatic reactions that are independent of fructose metabolism. Further, KHK OE and KD samples are useful to ensure that the assay is specific to quantify fructose metabolism via KHK-C.</p>
<p>The distance of the sensor from the sample can affect the intensity of luminescence signal. Since sensor height can be variable, absolute KHK-C activity cannot be compared from one lab to the other.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Luminescence readings are not consistent. Duplicate samples have different readings.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Luminescence signal from neighboring wells may be captured by the sensor. A potential solution is to use a white plate as referenced in this protocol, and not a standard clear plate. Another possibility is to lower the distance between the plate and luminescence reader (Step 35).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>KHK-C is not increased in samples that are expected to have high KHK-C activity.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The reaction mixture is sensitive to the amount of protein lysate used in the assay. Please ensure that the protein amount is less than 0.025 ug/uL (Step 22). If more protein is used luminescence readings will be paradoxically lower.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>KHK-C activity is too high.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Calcium interacts with the assay and cause high KHK-C activity even when no protein lysate is added. Make sure calcium is not present in the buffers (Step 22).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>KHK-C activity is too low.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The position of the sensor has direct effect on the intensity of luminescence. The height of the sensor can be adjusted using auto-adjust function (Step 35).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Fold increase in KHK-C protein is much higher than the percent increase in KHK-C activity.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>ADP production from the pathways not related to fructose metabolism can contribute to high background. Normalize the data to the reaction mixtures containing no fructose or 3OMF to calculate fold increase due to fructose metabolism (Step 36).</p>
