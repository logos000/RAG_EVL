<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Fever is a complex physiological response enhancing immune surveillance during infection and inflammation. Fever-range whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) treatment can experimentally mimic the febrile condition in mice. Here, we describe a protocol for the treatment of mice with WBH and normothermia. We describe the isolation of T cells from mouse spleen followed by the evaluation of T-cell adhesion and transmigration. This animal model can be applied to studying the dysfunction of the immune system induced by fever.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib7">Lin et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Fever is a highly conserved response to infection or injury in both endothermic and ectothermic species (<a href="#bib5">Evans et al., 2015</a>). Previously, researchers usually treated lymphocytes directly with fever-range temperatures and demonstrated that fever could markedly stimulate L-selectin and α4β7 integrin–dependent adhesion of lymphocytes to HEVs (<a href="#bib3">Chen et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bib4">Evans et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib6">Evans et al., 2001</a>). To study the biological function of fever on lymphocyte adhesion and transmigration more physiologically, we’d better treat mice with fever-range whole-body hyperthermia (WBH, core temperature 39.5 ± 0.5°C), and then isolate T cells from mouse spleen to carry out the cell function assay.</p>
<p>Firstly, we examined the effect of fever-range thermal stress on α4β1 or α4β7 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to immobilized VCAM-1 or MAdCAM-1, respectively, under flow conditions in the presence of physiological cations (1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> + Mg<sup>2+</sup>) (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A). For experiments using VCAM-1 substrate, T cells were pre-treated with α4β7 blocking antibody DATK32 to block α4β7–VCAM-1 binding in order to specifically examine the function of α4β1-VCAM-1 interaction. T cells from WBH mice showed a significant increase in adhesion to immobilized VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1 at wall shear stress of 1 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> compared with cells from NT mice. In addition, T cells from WBH mice showed significantly enhanced chemokine CCL21-induced transmigration across the VCAM-1– or MAdCAM-1–coated membrane (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B). Collectively, fever-range thermal stress significantly enhanced α4 integrin mediated cell adhesion and transmigration.</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 3. WBH treatment enhances α4 integrin mediated T cell adhesion and transmigration</div>
<p>C57BL/6J mice were treated with normothermia (NT) or fever-range whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) for 6 h, and then were sacrificed. T cells were isolated from spleen. α4β7–VCAM-1 binding was disrupted by pre-treating the cells with 10 μg/mL α4β7 blocking antibody DATK32 when examining α4β1-mediated cell adhesion and migration on VCAM-1 substrate.</p>

<p>Statistical significance was determined by Student’s <i>t</i> test using Prism software (GraphPad, version 5.01). The resulting p values are indicated as follows: ns, not significant; ∗, p &lt; 0.05; ∗∗, p &lt; 0.01; ∗∗∗, p &lt; 0.001. Data represent the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol describes the evaluation of T cell adhesion and transmigration when mice treated with fever-range whole-body hyperthermia or normothermia <i>ex vivo</i>. By means of using distinct ligands, researchers could specifically study the biological function mediated by integrins, selectins, chemokine receptors. Whereas, if you want to study the T cell trafficking <i>in vivo</i>, T cell distribution in various lymphoid tissues could be examined, and intravital microscopy might also be taken into consideration.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Mice were dehydrated and died during WBH treatment (step 1).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When treated by fever-range whole-body hyperthermia, the lymph nodes of mice swelled up obviously, and in some severe cases mice might die from dehydration or organ failure. To avoid the negative effect, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mL sterile 0.9% saline in advance.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>If researchers want to study cell adhesion ability of other cell types, 5 μg/mL mouse VCAM-1-Fc or MAdCAM-1-Fc might not be sufficient to mediate the binding of cells under flow conditions (step 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The concentration of mouse VCAM-1-Fc or MAdCAM-1-Fc could range from 2 μg/mL to 50 μg/mL, considering different cell types express distinct levels of integrin α4β1 and α4β7.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The status of isolated T cells was not very well and the following cell adhesion and transmigration could not be carried out successfully (step 16).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To evaluate the cell adhesion and transmigration of isolated T cells as soon as possible, steps 12 to 15 could be carried out during fever-range whole-body hyperthermia treatment of mice and T cell isolation. Once T cells were isolated from mouse spleen, they could be used in the flow chamber assay and transwell assay directly.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>T cells could not adhere to immobilized VCAM-1 or MAdCAM-1 under flow conditions (step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>No matter integrin ligands (VCAM-1 or MAdCAM-1) were purchased by commercial companies or purified by researches themselves, the affinity of the ligands to integrin α4β1 or α4β7 should be tested in advance. For example, you could investigate the soluble ligand binding ability by flow cytometry.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Too many T cells adhered to immobilized VCAM-1 or MAdCAM-1 under flow conditions (step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To block the non-specific binding of T cells to the surface of the polystyrene petri dish, the chamber could be washed with 1–2 mL washing buffer by the syringe pump. EDTA in the washing buffer could chelate the remaining metal ions that might activate integrins. If the non-specific binding still exits, please try to use another clean polystyrene petri dish to coat integrin ligand.</p>
