<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>BAX activation techniques are crucial to studying the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis— thousands of pro-apoptotic signals converge on BAX activation. Current methodologies are predominantly limited to membrane permeabilization studies, which assess endpoint functionality of oligomeric BAX, but overlook early activation steps of cytosolic BAX. Here we detail FLAMBE: a <u>f</u>luorescence polarization <u>l</u>igand <u>a</u>ssay for <u>m</u>onitoring <u>B</u>AX <u>e</u>arly-activation in solution. We also describe a dual-metric parameterization strategy for distillation of kinetic data and comparative analyses when studying candidate ligands.</p>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Multiple detergents (e.g., CHAPS, Triton X-100, SDS) have been demonstrated to affect BAX conformation and activity, even at nanomolar concentrations (<a href="#bib6">Hsu and Youle, 1997</a>).

Therefore, we suggest using separate materials and labware when preparing reagents necessary for this assay.</div>
<ol>
<li>Prepare single-use aliquots (10–25 μL) of recombinant human BAX protein at a concentration of 10–30 μM (storing BAX at higher concentrations may risk aggregation and precipitation over time resulting in confounding observations; see <a href="#sec7.5">problems 3</a> and <a href="#sec7.7">4</a> in the <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section).

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10–20 min</div>
<p>FP assays are a type of fluorospectrometric technique that detect molecular interactions by measuring changes in polarized light. An FP assay uses a polarizer to generate “plane-polarized light” (consisting of a single polarization) from a traditional illumination source, which produces light consisting of several polarizations. The plane-polarized light excites a fluorescent probe, which then emits light consisting of several polarizations due to random rotation ("tumbling") during the fluorescence lifetime (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The degree of depolarization from the initial plane-polarized light is proportional to the rate of tumbling and therefore the molecular volume of the probe. When the probe is bound, the increased molecular volume results in slower tumbling and light is emitted with less polarization diversity. Emission intensity (<i>I</i>) is measured through parallel and perpendicular polarizers and may be expressed as a fractional ratio called Polarization (<i>P</i>), which represents the ratio of divergence from the initial plane-polarized light. The Polarization value of a whole sample is the weighted average of individual emissions from bound and unbound probes and may be used to approximate the population fraction of bound probe. Of note, the Polarization of the probe is inversely proportional to the concentration and therefore investigators should select a concentration that provides adequate signal resolution compared to buffer-alone control, which marks the limiting Polarization value for a particular assay setup.</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Principle of a kinetic FP assay</div>
<p>Plane-polarized light is used to excite a fluorescent ligand. In the unbound state, the ligand tumbles faster in solution and emits light in several polarizations that is recorded by parallel and perpendicular polarizers. In the bound state, the increase in molecular volume of the ligand results in slower tumbling and light is emitted in fewer polarizations that are more parallel to the exciting plane-polarized light. The metric, Polarization (<i>P</i>), is calculated from the parallel (∥) and perpendicular (⊥) intensities (<i>I</i>) for each time point (<i>t</i>).

<p>Below are the steps for creating an FP protocol using the Gen5 software with a BioTek Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Plate Reader. Investigators using plate readers from other companies should consult the manufacturer's instructions for creating analogous protocols to measure fluorescence polarization.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Launch the Gen5 software on the computer connected to the Synergy H1 reader. This will automatically open the software's Task Manager window. From the left menu of the Task Manager window, select "Protocols". On the right menu, select "Create new".</li>
<li>In the pop-up menu, select "Standard protocol". This will create a "File" menu on the left for options to edit the protocol's Procedure, Plate Layout, Data Reduction, and Report/Export Builders.</li>
<li>Install the fluorescence polarization cube according to the manufacturer's instructions (if needed). In this execution of the protocol, we use a red FP filter cube (BioTek Cat#: 8040562) with the following parameters: Ex: 530/25, Em: 590/35, Dichroic: 570 nm.</li>
<li>
<i>Procedure.</i> Define the parameters of the measurements.

<ul>
<li>The Synergy H1 plate reader may be replaced by other BioTek microplate readers compatible with a red FP filter cube, including: Cytation 5, Cytation Multi-Mode, and Cytation 1. These readers all utilize the Gen5 Microplate Reader and Imager Software; however, certain assay parameters may differ by machine. Alternative FP-compatible multi-mode plate readers include: BMG LABTECH POLARstar Omega®, PerkinElmer® VICTOR® Nivo™, and Tecan Infinite® 200 PRO. Investigators will have to consult the manufacturer's documentation to set up an analogous protocol to measure fluorescence polarization and adjust the steps within this protocol for their plate reader.</li>
<li>Investigators may purchase commercially available recombinant human BAX protein, but the preferred method is to express and purify recombinant BAX protein in-house (<a href="#bib9">Suzuki et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al., 2022</a>).</li>
<li>Unlabeled BAK-BH3 peptide (AnaSpec Cat#: AS-61616) may be purchased and conjugated to a different fluorescent label at the investigator's discretion provided the plate reader has a compatible FP cube installed or available.</li>
<li>This protocol may be adapted by using alternative reporter peptides that bind BAX at distinct sites (example reporter peptides used in <a href="#bib7">Pritz et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib3">Garner et al., 2019</a>). We have validated the use of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> to monitor BAX activation kinetics but investigators using alternative peptides will have to validate their assay to exclude the possibility of direct competition and properly interpret binding and dissociation patterns.</li>
<li>The multi-channel pipette, 96-well PCR plate, and 96-well black polystyrene microplate can be substituted with equivalent products.

<h2 id="step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</h2>
<p>We developed a fluorescence polarization assay for monitoring BAX early-activation (abbreviated as "FLAMBE"; see <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al., 2022</a>) in which a TAMRA-labeled BAK-BH3 peptide (BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup>) binds to, but does not activate, BAX (<a href="#bib1">Czabotar et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib2">Dewson et al., 2012</a>). Binding of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> to BAX results in an increase in Polarization over time, reaching a plateau as the maximum number of heterodimers form (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, dotted line). In samples exhibiting BAX activation, intramolecular rearrangements within BAX are accompanied by a concomitant release of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> and a decrease in Polarization signal over time (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, solid line). At any given time, the Polarization value represents the population fraction of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> bound to BAX, and therefore indicates the fraction of activated BAX following dissociation (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, right). We have validated that changes in Polarization reflect the binding status of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> and fully characterized the FLAMBE technique in <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al. (2022)</a>.</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 2. Schematic of BAX and BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> interactions within FLAMBE</div>
<p>For this assay, we use a TAMRA-labeled BAK<sup>BH3</sup> peptide (BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup>) and monitor changes in Polarization as a consequence of binding to BAX. As the BAX population binds BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup>, Polarization increases and plateaus if the entire population is heterodimeric (dotted line). Upon BAX activation, BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> is displaced resulting in a decrease in Polarization over time as the population of unbound BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> molecules increases (solid line). This diagram is reproduced and adapted from <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al. (2022)</a>.</p>

<p>This section details three types of titration experiments to monitor BAX activation, and can be used sequentially as a workflow to determine the effect of a candidate ligand on BIM<sup>BH3</sup>-induced BAX activation. All assays must be performed in a black 96-well microplate and step-by-step details and timing for each major experiment are provided. It is recommended that experimental samples do not exceed duplicates to avoid delays in preparing replicates (see the <a href="#limitations">limitations</a> section for more details). Typical investigations will include a BAX titration and a 2- or 3-component assay (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). The experimental wells must be in consecutive columns and every experiment must include a BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> control. Investigators must also include a "0" control, which represents the "0" concentration of the titrant (commonly BAX+BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup>, but may include additional components that constitute the background). To reduce pipetting error across duplicates, we recommend using a multi-channel pipette when performing the serial dilution of BAX or a titrant (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A). To capture the rapid binding kinetics of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup>, we recommend using a PCR plate (or similar) as a reagent reservoir to quickly add BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> (or other components) to all wells (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B).</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Determine an appropriate BAX concentration for downstream investigations</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 70–80 min</div>
<p>Studying BAX is a bit of a Catch-22 – sufficient protein is necessary to achieve and detect robust activation kinetics, but BAX may exhibit concentration-dependent auto-activation despite the absence of an activator. The ideal BAX concentration for FLAMBE experiments is just below the auto-activating point; this will ensure that downstream assays resolve the activation kinetics in response to activators or modulators. However, certain experiments may benefit from using BAX at a slightly activating concentration (e.g., inhibition studies). Diligent characterization of BAX concentrations within FLAMBE allows the user to calibrate downstream investigations and mitigates any variability that may arise between protein batches, concentration determination, or protein aggregation during prolonged storage at −80°C. Investigators should perform this experiment on each day of investigation using fresh aliquots of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> and recombinant BAX (see <a href="#sec7.5">problem 3</a> in the <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section).</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 5. Experimental kinetic FLAMBE data</div>
<p>(A) BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> (50 nM) was added to BAX (42–125 nM) and fluorescence polarization was measured. Stable BAX:BAK<sup>T</sup><sup>AMRA</sup> heterodimer formation is observed at lower concentrations (purple and blue data). The threshold concentration for BAX auto-activation is identified in green as the lowest concentration that exhibits a decrease in Polarization i.e., BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> displacement. Higher concentrations result in faster kinetics of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> displacement (yellow through red data). Data are reproduced from <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al. (2022)</a>.</p>
<p>(B) BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> (50 nM) was added to BAX (60 nM) in the presence of BIM<sup>BH3</sup> (BIM, 0.08–2.5 μM) and fluorescence polarization was measured. Gray line represents BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> control. The BAX control (black data) is weakly auto-activating, resulting in a step-wise trend in displacement of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> as BAX is activated by BIM<sup>BH3</sup>.</p>
<p>(C) Similar experiment as in (B). BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> (50 nM) was added to BAX (40 nM) in the presence of BIM<sup>BH3</sup> (BIM, 0.04–1.2 μM) and fluorescence polarization was measured. Gray line represents BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> control. The non-activating concentration of BAX (black data) reveals that low concentrations of BIM<sup>BH3</sup> result in stable binding to the BAK:BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> heterodimer and an increase in Polarization (blue data). The threshold BIM<sup>BH3</sup> concentration for activating BAX is identified in green and additional concentrations of BIM<sup>BH3</sup> increase activation kinetics (yellow through red data).</p>
<p>(D) FP assay in which BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> (50 nM) was added to BAX (40 nM) in the presence of BIM<sup>BH3</sup> (BIM, 0.04–1.2 μM) and BIF44 (250 μM). Binding of BIF44 to BAX reveals an increase in Polarization compared to the BAX control (dark gray compared to black data). The addition of BIM<sup>BH3</sup> reveals a step-wise progression of BAX activation kinetics, demonstrating that the BAX+BIF44 condition was at the threshold concentration for activation.</p>

<p>The following steps describe the protocol for measuring and characterizing trends of BIM<sup>BH3</sup>-induced BAX activation. BIM is the predominant BCL-2 family protein responsible for activating BAX in cells, converging a myriad of stress and pro-apoptotic signal pathways onto BAX-mediated apoptosis (<a href="#bib8">Sarosiek et al., 2013</a>). BAX exhibits multiple conformers following activation by BIM and therefore investigators are likely to test their ligand of interest within the context of BIM-activated BAX (additional details regarding BIM triggering and the BAX activation continuum are discussed in <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al., 2022</a>). We describe using a BIM<sup>BH3</sup> peptide due to its commercial availability, stability, and potent activation of BAX; alternative BIM reagents (e.g., recombinant BIM protein, stapled BIM SAHB peptide) may be substituted but require more specialization to produce.</p>

<p class="math-ml"><math> <mrow> <msub> <mi>P</mi> <mi>t</mi> </msub> <mo>=</mo> <mspace width="0.25em"></mspace> <mfrac> <mrow> <msub> <mi>I</mi> <msub> <mo>∥</mo> <mi>t</mi> </msub> </msub> <mo>−</mo> <msub> <mi>I</mi> <msub> <mo>⊥</mo> <mi>t</mi> </msub> </msub> </mrow> <mrow> <msub> <mi>I</mi> <msub> <mo>∥</mo> <mi>t</mi> </msub> </msub> <mo>+</mo> <msub> <mi>I</mi> <msub> <mo>⊥</mo> <mi>t</mi> </msub> </msub> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math></p>
<p>where: <math> <mrow> <msub> <mi>P</mi> <mi>t</mi> </msub> </mrow> </math> is the Polarization value for a sample at a given time point, <i>t</i>; <math> <mrow> <msub> <mi>I</mi> <msub> <mo>∥</mo> <mi>t</mi> </msub> </msub> </mrow> </math> is the parallel intensity value at time point <i>t</i>; and <math> <mrow> <msub> <mi>I</mi> <msub> <mo>⊥</mo> <mi>t</mi> </msub> </msub> </mrow> </math> is the perpendicular intensity at time point <i>t</i>. Polarization is a unitless metric but is conventionally expressed as milliPolarization (<i>mP</i>) units.</p>
<p>An initial BAX titration experiment is required to identify the ideal concentration for downstream BAX activation studies. Investigators must reconcile two opposing considerations regarding BAX biology: (i) BAX may auto-activate at high concentrations; and paradoxically, (ii) upon activation, BAX requires an adequate concentration to sufficiently perpetuate within the population. The first point is demonstrated in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A, where the BAX threshold for auto-activation was observed (green data); concentrations exhibiting auto-activation are generally not appropriate to select for downstream investigations but may be relevant to inhibition studies (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A, red through green data). In contrast, lower range concentrations achieved stable plateaus and exhibited a step-wise increase in Polarization values, which is expected as more BAX in the sample forms heterodimers with BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A, blue and purple lines). The second point is important for selecting which of the stably-binding concentrations is most appropriate. Choosing a concentration too close to the threshold risks BAX stochastically auto-activating in downstream assays while choosing too low a concentration risks insufficient population responses following BAX activation. The ideal concentration is just below threshold, which will ensure adequate BAX concentrations for downstream activation studies (in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A we would select the concentration of the light blue data). Additionally, this will ensure that the ratio of BAX:BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> will generate data with sufficient resolution to observe activation kinetics.</p>
<p>In a cell, BIM is the predominant activator of BAX. We employed a BIM-BH3 peptide (BIM<sup>BH3</sup>) to study BAX activation in this assay as it has been shown to target a distinct "trigger" site, which is distal to the predicted BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> binding site (<a href="#bib4">Gavathiotis et al., 2008</a>). Investigators utilizing FLAMBE to study BAX activation should verify the binding site of a candidate ligand on BAX to accurately interpret kinetic FP data (see the <a href="#limitations">limitations</a> section). Activation studies with BIM<sup>BH3</sup> may be used to determine the sensitivity of BAX to activate and are typically conducted as BIM<sup>BH3</sup> titrations; these data may also be informative for more specific synergistic experiments (an example of such an experiment is shown in Figures 5H and 5I of <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al., 2022</a>). Trends in BIM<sup>BH3</sup> titration experiments are dependent on the concentration of BAX and may exhibit different patterns (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>B and 5C). If the BAX concentration is at or near the auto-activation threshold (slight downward trend in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B, black data), investigators will likely observe a step-wise progression of dissociation kinetics as the population is proportionally activated by the amount of BIM<sup>BH3</sup> (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B). If the selected concentration of BAX is far below threshold, investigators may observe that low BIM<sup>BH3</sup> doses exhibit increased Polarization and faster binding kinetics compared to the BAX control (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C, light blue data). This increase in Polarization is indicative of heterotrimerization – stable binding of BIM<sup>BH3</sup> to the BAK:BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> heterodimer without BAX activation (<a href="#bib10">Tsai et al., 2015</a>). While either outcome is valid, investigators should note how the "tipping point" of BIM activation is affected by the selection of BAX concentration. The activation profile in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C may be preferable as it will indicate non-activating concentrations of BIM<sup>BH3</sup>, which may be useful for subsequent assays. Of note, similar trends and considerations may also apply for ligand titration experiments.</p>
<p>3-component assays may be used to study the synergistic response of BAX to BIM and a binding ligand (here, "ligand" is not limited to being a small molecule and we have tested a diverse repertoire of BAX modulators including peptides, lipids, and detergents; see <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al., 2022</a>). To illustrate this experimental workflow, we have included data for a duplicate BIM<sup>BH3</sup> titration in the presence of a small molecule BAX activator, BIF44 (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D) (<a href="#bib7">Pritz et al., 2017</a>). A common feature of these experiments is a global increase in Polarization caused by the ligand binding to the BAX:BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> heterodimer (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D, "BAX+BIF44" compared to "BAX"). While differences between assays may be qualitatively assessed, a more direct method may be necessary to properly compare the data and infer conclusions (compare <a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>C and 5D). We developed a method to parameterize kinetic FLAMBE data and visualize changes when two experiments are compared (see the <a href="#quantification-and-statistical-analysis">quantification and statistical analysis</a> section). Of note, investigators should also perform the reciprocal experiment using a titration of ligand in the presence of a single concentration of BIM<sup>BH3</sup>. This may be compared to an identical ligand titration experiment conducted in the absence of BIM<sup>BH3</sup>.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>This section will describe how to parameterize FLAMBE data for visualization and comparative analyses. Kinetic graphs are the preferred method to report FLAMBE data and therefore parameterization is optional. However, parameterized data benefits from being more succinct, making it suited for certain applications. The following steps will detail how investigators may use Microsoft Excel or GraphPad Prism to parameterize their data but may be adapted for other software. Alternatively, investigators may utilize our included "FLAMBE_Parameterization" Excel template (<a href="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1515-Mmc1.xlsx">Data S1</a>), which is set up to automatically parameterize metrics from imported raw data and may simplify the process for users who are less familiar with Excel formulas.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Parameterize FLAMBE kinetic data</h3>
<p>FLAMBE captures the kinetics of BAX activation, which is more data-rich and informative than endpoint observations but may also be more difficult to interpret or discuss. To distill kinetic FLAMBE data, we selected a dual-metric parameterization strategy: endpoint Polarization (EP) and the time point of maximum Polarization (T<sub>max</sub>) (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>A, left panel). Based on coupled functional assays, we have demonstrated that these parameters allow investigators to make accurate inferences as to the functional state of activated BAX at the end of the assay (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>A, right panel) (<a href="#bib5">Gelles et al., 2022</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the mean for replicate time points.
<ol type="a">
<li>We suggest averaging replicates prior to parameterization to smooth the data. Even miniscule deviations between replicates or data noise may substantially affect the determination of T<sub>max</sub> (and, to a lesser extent, EP) resulting in wide T<sub>max</sub> ranges. Averaging the replicates prior to parameterization will generate more reliable metrics (see <a href="#sec7.11">problem 6</a> in the <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section for additional advice on parameterizing noisy Polarization data).
<ol type="i">
<li>In Excel, this is accomplished using the MEAN function.</li>
<li>In Prism, analyze the data table using "Row Statistics" and selecting "Compute the mean, median, etc. for each data set column" with "means" and "SD, N" selected in the drop-down menus.</li>
<li>If using the FLAMBE_Parameterization template, data pasted into the "Raw_Data" sheet will automatically be averaged in the "Averages" sheet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Determine EP for samples.
<ol type="a">
<li>Endpoint Polarization (EP) is simply the Polarization values for samples at the completion of the FP assay. Due to the dynamic binding and displacement of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> during BAX activation, EP alone is not sufficiently informative and should not be used as the sole metric to summarize FLAMBE data.
<ol type="i">
<li>EP values may be taken directly from the final read of the averaged data from step 1. Alternatively, investigators may average the last 3–5 data points to minimize the influence of noise.</li>
<li>If using the FLAMBE_Parameterization template, EP is automatically extracted from the final time point, regardless of the assay duration, and is populated in the "Parameterization" sheet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The EP metric may provide insights into the percentage of the BAX population that has been activated. For example, the yellow line in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D flattens, which indicates that approximately 50%–60% of the BAX population released BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> but the activation stimulus was insufficient to activate the entire population. At <i>t</i><sub><i>60</i></sub> some conditions may still be resolving, but extending beyond this time negligibly impacts the data.</li>
<li>Generally, EP values near the BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> control indicate activation while values near the BAX control indicate association, but no BAX activation. EP values may be greater than the BAX control if the titrant binds to the BAX:BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> heterodimer and increases the molecular volume – these data are still interpreted as association events with no activation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Determine T<sub>max</sub> for samples.
<ol type="a">
<li>Time of maximum Polarization (T<sub>max</sub>) is the time point with the highest Polarization value for a given sample. First, identify the maximum Polarization value for each sample from the averaged data in step 1 and then identify the time point at which that maximum occurred.
<ol type="i">
<li>In Excel, determine the maximum Polarization for each sample using the MAX function. To identify the corresponding time point, use either the XLOOKUP function (if available in your version of Excel) or a nested formula with INDEX and MATCH (this two-part formula first identifies the row of the spreadsheet and then may retrieve a cell in the same row but different column).</li>
<li>Graphpad Prism does not have an easy method to accomplish this, but there is a multi-step workaround. (i) Analyze the data table using "Normalization", setting the 0% as the "smallest value in each data set" and the 100% as the "largest value in each data set", and present results as fractions. (ii) Next, analyze the normalized data table using "Transform" and, in the next window, create a user-defined Y function with the equation "Y=if(Y=1,X,0)". (iii) Finally, analyze the transformed data table using "Descriptive Statistics" with only the "Minimum and maximum, range" option selected – the "maximum" values listed are the T<sub>max</sub> for each sample.</li>
<li>If using the FLAMBE_Parameterization template, the maximum Polarization and T<sub>max</sub> metrics are automatically identified and provided in the "Parameterization" sheet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For non-activating BAX samples, the T<sub>max</sub> will correlate with the EP as the population forms heterodimers and Polarization signal plateaus (see <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>A, left panel, "Condition 1"). In activating conditions, the T<sub>max</sub> will represent the time at which the rate of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> dissociation outpaces binding. Therefore, low T<sub>max</sub> values indicate BAX activation since BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> dissociation must have occurred if the maximum Polarization was measured early in the assay (see <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>A, left panel, "Conditions 2 &amp; 3").</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> T<sub>max</sub> for samples exhibiting very rapid BAX activation may not be detected by the time the measurements begin (for example, the red data in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B). Since the data remains fairly constant during the assay, identification of a T<sub>max</sub> will be unreliable and may be skewed by noise within the kinetic data. For these samples, consider the T<sub>max</sub> to be 0.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> T<sub>max</sub> for BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> is always set to 0.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Normalize EP and T<sub>max</sub> to the controls.
<ol type="a">
<li>Parameterized metrics will be normalized against the BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> control (set to 0) and the BAX control (set to 1) (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>B, which is the parameterized data from <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). Using this method, data from multiple experiments with similar conditions may be compared on the same plot (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>C, which is the comparison of parameterized data from <a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>C and 5D).
<ol type="i">
<li>In Excel, parameterized metrics may be normalized using the formula "(X-X<sub>BAK</sub>)/(X<sub>BAX</sub>-X<sub>BAK</sub>)", where: X is the metric (either EP or T<sub>max</sub>); X<sub>BAK</sub> is the metric from the BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> control; and X<sub>BAX</sub> is the metric from the BAX control.</li>
<li>In Prism, generate a new XY data table with raw EP and T<sub>max</sub> values as separate Y groups. Importantly, the first row must be the BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> control and the last row must be the BAX control being normalized against. Analyze the table using "Normalize" with 0% defined as "first value in each data set" and 100% defined as "last value in each data set" and presenting results as fractions.</li>
<li>If using the FLAMBE_Parameterization template, the normalized metrics are automatically calculated and provided in the "Parameterization" sheet. Additionally, users may supply parameterized metrics for two similar experiments in the "BeforeAndAfter" sheet to generate a comparison graph.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>While Normalized EP may be a negative value (for samples with robust activation and EP values below BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup>), normalizing T<sub>max</sub> should never result in a negative value.</li>
<li>Occasionally, experiments should not be normalized if there is no consistent control to normalize samples to. As an example, testing BIM sensitivity across BAX mutants cannot be normalized because each mutant is compared to its own "no activation" condition (such an experiment is shown in Figure 4K of <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al., 2022</a>). These experiments may still be compared and visualized using the raw EP and T<sub>max</sub> values.</li>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The FLAMBE technique is a useful tool to study BAX activation in real-time. However, this method is accompanied by certain limitations.</p>
<p>The rapid kinetics of binding and release of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> from BAX restricts the number of confident replicates to duplicates, as setup of additional replicates causes a divergence in the read time for any given set of replicates, thus obfuscating kinetic trends. More rapid measurements allow for richer kinetic data collection but reduces the throughput of the assay. Due to this limitation, we suggest investigators increase the number of replicated experiments to confidently determine reproducibility.</p>
<p>BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> is predicted to bind to the BAX BC groove and is released following activation-induced BAX conformational changes (e.g., in response to triggering by BIM). Therefore, investigating agents that target the BAX BC groove (e.g., BID) may confound data interpretation due to competition-mediated BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> dissociation, which will be conflated with activation-induced BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> dissociation. Additionally, the unstructured nature of the BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> peptide may confer binding flexibility and affinity to BAX. A peptide probe exhibiting secondary structure may alter the pattern of kinetic data in FLAMBE. The unstructured nature of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> may also promote interactions with a candidate ligand – typically observed as an increase in Polarization compared to the BAX control (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D, compare "BAX" and "BAX+BIF44" lines). If the interaction is too strong, BAX activation trends may be obfuscated and investigators may either have to select an alternative labeled peptide or select a different method to study their ligand of interest.</p>
<p>This protocol provides instructions for carrying out FLAMBE assays in 0.5× PBS. Alternative buffers may be used for compatibility with downstream assays (e.g., LUV permeabilization assays) or to aid in folding of peptides. However, differences between buffers and salt concentration may affect the behavior of peptides in solution as well as interactions with BAX, and this will change the appearance of kinetic data.</p>
<p>FLAMBE observations represent a surrogate readout for activation-induced intramolecular rearrangements in BAX that promote release of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup>. While data interpretations are based in our understanding of BAX activation biology, the precise mechanism of trigger-induced BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> release remains unknown. Additionally, since FLAMBE is a membrane-free system, general conclusions about ligand-induced modulation of BAX activation should not be made solely from FLAMBE data. Observations made with FLAMBE should be accompanied by downstream functional assays (e.g., size-exclusion chromatography, membrane permeabilization assessments) to interrogate and characterize late-stage steps of the BAX activation continuum (for more details see <a href="#bib5">Gelles et al., 2022</a>).</p>

<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> Polarization signal increases during the assay or has increased from one experiment to another.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>An increase in BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> signal likely indicates decreased peptide quality stemming from either prolonged light exposure or peptide aggregation from prolonged incubation at temperatures above 4°C (counterintuitively, both a lower fluorescent signal and probe aggregation will result in higher Polarization). Since the measured Polarization is the weighted average of every BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> molecule's Polarization, even minority subpopulations may affect the observed values. We recommend storing and preparing BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> in amber tubes to limit exposure to light (see step 2 of the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section). Additionally, BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> working solutions should be made fresh from 0.5 mM master stocks on the day of the experiment and kept on ice or at 4°C, protected from light, for the duration of experimentation. To test if BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> is aggregating, investigators may compare Polarization values for BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> alone or with low concentration detergent (e.g., 0.01% Triton X-100), which would reveal if Polarization was increased due to aggregates in the population.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The Polarization endpoint for some of the experimental conditions are below that of the BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> control.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is expected and likely due to a minority subpopulation of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> aggregates in the stock. While the aggregates remain in the BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> control (and slightly raise the "background" Polarization value), the aggregates may separate during the process of binding and release from BAX, particularly in samples exhibiting robust activation kinetics (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A, red data). This observation does not affect data analysis or interpretation and is why normalized EP values may be negative values. Importantly, modifications to this assay (e.g., buffer composition, alternative labeled probe) may eliminate this phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The BAX control is auto-activating at a concentration at which it was stable on a previous day.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is relatively common and may be due to a few reasons, including: (i) lot-to-lot variability of the recombinant protein; (ii) loss of stability due to prolonged storage; and (iii) concentration-dependent auto-activation. If the selected BAX concentration was on the cusp of exhibiting auto-activation, it is not improbable that the same concentration could stochastically exhibit activation in a subsequent assay (further discussed in the <a href="#expected-outcomes">expected outcomes</a> section). It is strongly recommended that a BAX titration is performed prior to any subsequent experimentation on a given day to confirm the selection of a non-activating concentration of BAX. Additionally, we recommend that for a given day of experimentation, investigators pool fresh aliquots of BAX to be used that same day.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Trends between identical BIM titration experiments are divergent even though the same concentration of BAX was used.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is due to the inherent biology of BAX – conformational changes promote dimerization and multimerization resulting in activation. Prolonged storage of BAX is prone to multimerization and precipitation, which may alter the concentration of soluble protein and subsequently the final concentration of BAX within the assay. To decrease the likelihood of this occurring, it is recommended to store master stocks of BAX at a concentration of 10–30 μM (see step 1 of the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>BAX activation profiles in response to BIM or a candidate ligand are meager.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This may occur if the concentration selected from the initial BAX titration was too low and there is not enough BAX to sufficiently activate the population in response to an activator (this consideration is discussed in the <a href="#expected-outcomes">expected outcomes</a>section). This may be rectified by revisiting the BAX titration experiment and selecting a higher concentration of BAX that forms stable heterodimers with BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup>.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>The kinetic data is noisy and is affecting data parameterization.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the kinetic data trends are noisy, this may affect the EP and T<sub>max</sub> values retrieved (for example, a spike in a datapoint for the BAX control may result in a T<sub>max</sub> that does not properly reflect the kinetic trend). To resolve this issue, investigators may apply a smoothing function to the kinetic data (such as the Analysis option within Graphpad Prism). Alternatively, investigators may average the final 3–5 data points to minimize noise when obtaining EP values. Importantly, these solutions are non-disruptive and should not substantially alter the data or interpretations.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>The kinetic curves start at a high Polarization value and decrease over time – i.e., no initial increases in Polarization due to binding are captured.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is likely due to prolonged delay in loading the plate into the plate reader and commencing the assay. To capture any rapid initial binding kinetics, we recommend minimizing the time between adding BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> to experimental wells and running the assay. This time is also markedly reduced by launching the FP protocol on Gen5 beforehand (see steps 12–15 of the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.15">Problem 8</h3>
<p>The replicates are divergent and introduce large error bars in kinetic data.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.16">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This will occur if substantial time elapses between the addition of BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> to the first and second replicates. To reduce delays between setting up replicates, we recommend restricting experimental replicates to duplicates and using a PCR plate as a reservoir to quickly add BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> to replicate wells (see <a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a>; see step 4 of the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section). Additionally, increasing the excess BAK<sup>TAMRA</sup> in each well of the PCR plate before loading will avoid delays due to pipetting errors. This will afford users reduced lag time in reads between replicates and should reduce any deviation between replicates.</p>
