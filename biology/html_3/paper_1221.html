<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Macrophages are key innate immune cells involved in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological processes. Macrophage depletion with clodronate-liposomes is commonly used to investigate <i>in vivo</i> functions of macrophages in mice. Here, we describe a protocol that combines the depletion of resident macrophages with the reconstitution of the mice with <i>in vitro</i> differentiated, lentivirus-transduced bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in the context of an experimental sepsis model. This experimental strategy is easily adapted to other experimental designs.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00710-3/sref1">Du et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The principle of macrophage depletion by clodronate-containing liposomves is that macrophages undergo apoptosis upon phagocytosis of clodronate liposomes (<a href="#bib4">Naito et al., 1996</a>; <a href="#bib6">van Rooijen et al., 1996</a>). This is a very effective method. Substantial depletion of macrophages can usually be achieved within 24–48 h with a single dose of clodronate-liposome injection. This method is frequently used to explore the role of macrophages <i>in vivo</i> under various conditions. On the other hand, the macrophage-depleted mice can be reconstituted with exogenous macrophages that have been genetically modified or pharmacologically treated, so that the reconstituted mice are used as an <i>in vivo</i> model to study these new macrophages. As macrophages will repopulate the mice within 1–2 weeks following their depletion (<a href="#bib5">van Rooijen et al., 1989</a>), timing is crucial in the experimental design in order to generate meaningful results.</p>
<p>The depletion/reconstitution protocol that we describe here has several steps, including bone marrow (BM) cell preparation, lentiviral transduction of the BM cells<i>, in vitro</i> differentiation of the BM cells into BMDMs, liposome-induced macrophage depletion in mice, reconstitution of the mice with lentivirus-transduced BMDMs, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge of the reconstituted mice. Because every step is time-sensitive, a careful coordination of each step is crucial for the success of the experiment.</p>
<p>Because mice are used in this procedure, institutional approval of all animal use protocols should be obtained before the experimental planning.</p>
<p>Similar protocols for macrophage depletion and reconstitution can be found elsewhere (<a href="#bib2">Kozicky and Sly, 2019</a>).</p>

<p>L929 is a mouse fibroblast line that secretes macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), which is required for the differentiation of BMDMs from hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, L929 cell conditioned media are used to differentiate BMDMs (see <a href="#sec2.4">BMDM differentiation</a> step).</p>
<ol>
<li>Culture L929 cells in complete DMEM (<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>) in 10-cm cell culture dishes at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At about 80% confluency, replace the culture medium with fresh complete DMEM.

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–2 h</div>
<p>Two days after clodronate-liposome treatment, the macrophage-depleted mouse can be reconstituted with new macrophages. In this protocol, we used lentivirus-transduced BMDMs. These BMDMs are delivered by intravenous injection through the retro-orbital sinus. Because endogenous macrophages will repopulate the depleted mouse within 1–2 weeks (<a href="#bib5">van Rooijen et al., 1989</a>), there is a window of only 4–5 days in which the exogenous macrophages can be assayed in the mouse. Therefore, it is crucial that the experiment is planned so that the <i>in vitro</i> differentiation of BMDMs is completed and ready for use within this window.</p>
<ol start="27">

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol describes the procedure of macrophage depletion and reconstitution for a mouse model of experimental sepsis. There are several key factors that will determine the outcome of this protocol: the quality of the differentiated BMDMs (including the transduction efficiency of the BMDMs), the extent of macrophage depletion in the mouse, and the quick repopulation of the exogenous BMDMs in the recipient mouse.</p>
<p>If the quality of the L929 conditioned media is good, differentiation of BMDMs is expected to be achieved within 7 days. The cell morphology can usually give some hints (see <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). If the cells are not differentiated after 7 days, it suggests that the conditioned medium is not functional and the cells should be abandoned. In our hand, the lentiviral transduction protocol can usually generate very high transduction efficiency (&gt;80–90%) in the differentiated BMDMs.</p>
<p>The clodronate-liposome is very effective to deplete resident macrophages from a mouse. One dose of intravenous injection is expected to reduce spleen macrophages by &gt;90% within 1–2 days (See <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>
<p>At the end, whether the depletion/reconstitution procedure is successful has to be validated by experiments. Here we use our study as an example. In the study we aimed to assess whether SOCS1 functions downstream of YTHDF1 in the regulation of macrophage activation. To this end, we derived BMDMs from wild-type (WT) and YTHDF1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, and then transduced these WT and YTHDF1<sup>−/−</sup> BMDMs with SOCS1-lentivirus or GFP (Ctrl)-lentivirus, respectively. We depleted macrophages from WT mice, and then reconstituted these mice with the SOCS1- or GFP (Ctrl)-transduced WT or YTHDF1<sup>−/−</sup> BMDMs. Finally, we subjected these reconstituted mice to the LPS-induced sepsis model. As shown in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>, LPS challenge led to much higher mortality (100% death within 24 h) in the mice receiving Ctrl-transduced YTHDF1<sup>−/−</sup> BMDMs compared with the mice receiving Ctrl-transduced WT BMDMs (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A), and this is expected. The mice receiving Ctrl-transduced YTHDF1<sup>−/−</sup> BMDMs produced much higher levels of serum inflammatory cytokines than the mice receiving Ctrl-transduced WT BMDMs (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B), and this is also expected. These observations indicate that the lentivirus transduction and the depletion/reconstitution procedure were all successful (As all recipient mice were WT mice, if the procedures were not working, the phenotype of the recipient mice should be the same). When the mice receiving SOCS1-transduced YTHDF1<sup>−/−</sup> BMDMs were treated with LPS, the high mortality rate was prevented (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A), and the serum inflammatory cytokine levels were reduced to the Ctrl levels (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B). These data indicate that the depletion/reconstitution procedure indeed is an excellent system to study the <i>in vivo</i> function of exogenous macrophages. For detailed information about these experiments please refer to our publication (<a href="#bib1">Du et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p>Macrophage-depleted mice provide an experimental platform to study in vivo functions of macrophages - allowing for comparisons of mouse phenotypes in the presence and absence of macrophages. The macrophage depletion/reconstitution protocol described here moves a step further – allowing for study of in vivo functions of “exogenous” macrophages in the absence of the endogenous macrophages. The exogenous macrophages can be modified genetically or manipulated pharmacologically, so that the biological impact of the modification(s) in these macrophages can be evaluated in mice under different experimental conditions or disease models. As such, this protocol can be adapted to various experimental designs based on specific research purposes.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Macrophages are differentiated from bone marrow stem cells and precursor cells within tissues. Following clodronate-liposome-mediated macrophage depletion, the endogenous macrophages can repopulate the mouse within 1–2 weeks. As such, the entire experiment has to be completed within several days. Therefore, this protocol is only applicable to acute experimental models (such as the sepsis model). To sustain macrophage depletion for long-term studies, repeated clodronate-liposome injections may be used.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Cell contamination (Bone marrow isolations and <a href="#sec2.4">BMDM differentiation</a> steps)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Fully sterilize the surgical instrument by autoclave. Perform the whole procedure under a sterile environment. Cell contamination is a very common problem in this protocol.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Macrophages were not depleted (Liposome injection and Validation of macrophage deletion steps)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use fresh liposomes to inject mice. If stored properly at 4°C–8°C, liposomes can be effective for at least 6 weeks.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Mice died after liposome injection (Liposome injection steps)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure to properly homogenize the liposome solution before loading the syringe and immediately before injection. If the mixture is not homogenous, the mouse can die after injection. Air bubbles in the syringe can also cause death.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Low yield of BMDMs (<a href="#sec2.4">BMDM differentiation</a> steps)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Select a mouse at least 8-week old for bone marrow isolation. Make sure to completely flush out the bone marrow to collect all BM cells. Macrophage numbers are dependent on mouse age and genetic background. Approximately 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> BMDMs can be derived from an 8–12 week old C57BL/6 mouse. BMDM yield is considered low if less than 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> BMDMs are obtained from one mouse.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Mice died after macrophage reconstitution injection (Macrophage reconstitution steps)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure to suspend BMDMs in PBS well before intravenous injection. This is best done just prior to injection as BMDMs can clump quickly. Cell clumps can block blood flow leading to death.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>No difference is seen in experimental outcomes after BMDM reconstitution (Macrophage reconstitution steps)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This suggests some procedure is not working. Use PBS as a reconstitution control to sort out whether BMDM reconstitution is working. Use unmodified BMDMs as a control to figure out whether lentiviral transduction is working.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Efficiency of lentivirus-transduction is low (Lentiviral transduction steps)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that the ratio of lentivirus:cell is 10:1. Use of polybrene should improve transduction efficiency.</p>
