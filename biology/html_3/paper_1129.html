<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Neuronal loss resulting from progressive neurodegeneration is a major pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we present a protocol to detect neurodegeneration, neuronal apoptosis, and neuronal loss in 5XFAD mouse strain, which is a well-established model for interrogating the molecular mechanism of neuronal death in AD. This protocol describes the use of the neurodegenerative marker Fluro-Jade C, cleaved caspase-3 immunofluorescent staining and Nissl staining for the analysis of neurodegeneration and neuronal loss in 5XFAD mice.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00621-3/sref3">Zhang et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol describes the specific steps to analysis (1) neurodegeneration with the method of Fluro-Jade C (FJC) staining, (2) neuronal apoptosis using immunofluorescent staining with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody and (3) neuronal loss using Nissl staining combined with immunofluorescent staining with anti-NeuN antibody, in the brain slices of 9-month-old 5XFAD mice and age-matched wide-type (WT) control mice. In our experience, neurodegeneration can be analyzed using 6–9 months old 5XFAD mice. However, using 9–12 months old 5XFAD for neuronal apoptosis and neuronal loss analysis would be better, because the signal of cleaved caspase-3 is hard to be detected in the brain of younger 5XFAD mice.</p>
<p>Before the staining, you need to prepare the following animals and solutions (refer to ‘‘Materials and equipment’’ for detailed recipe.):</p>
<p>9 months old 5XFAD male mice and WT control male mice.</p>
<p>Pre-chilled 1× PBS for the perfusion of mouse brains.</p>
<p>4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixing solution.</p>
<p>Anti-freezing solution for the storage of mouse brain sections.</p>
<p>0.01% Fluro-Jade C stock solution for FJC staining.</p>
<p>0.06% potassium permanganate solution for FJC staining.</p>
<p>80% ethanol containing 1% NaOH for FJC staining.</p>
<p>Blocking buffer for immunofluorescent staining.</p>
<p>PBST washing buffer for immunofluorescent staining.</p>
<p>0.5% Cresyl violet solution for Nissl staining.</p>
<p>95% ethanol containing 0.7% glacial acetic acid de-staining solution for Nissl staining.</p>

<li>Anesthetize mice with Ketamine/Xylazine (Ketamine: 50–80 mg/kg; Xylazine: 5–10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Toe pinch reflection is recommended to monitor the depth of anesthesia. It usually takes 5–10 min to complete anesthesia.</li>
<li>Perfuse the mice with ice-cold 1× PBS via left ventricle.</li>
<li>Dissect out the whole brain carefully, and then put the brain into a 15 mL centrifuge tube containing 4% PFA over night with gentle shaking on an orbital shaker at a speed of 50 rpm in cold room (4°C–8°C).</li>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4–5 h</div>
<p><b>Rationale:</b> Cresyl violet acetate solution is able to stain Nissl substance in the cytoplasm of neurons. Nissl granules are purple, nuclei of glial cells and endothelial cells are slightly bluer than Nissl granules. Thus, the neuronal density in brain section can be measured by Nissl staining using Cresyl violet acetate.</p>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Aged 5XFAD mice display significant neuronal loss in cortical layer 5 and subiculum of hippocampus according to literature (<a href="#bib1">Oakley et al., 2006</a>). However, significant neuronal loss can also be detected in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus in 9-month-old 5XFAD mice (<a href="#bib3">Zhang et al., 2021</a>). But the neuronal loss in dentate gyrus is hard to be analyzed via Nissl staining method due to compact localization of hippocampal neurons in dentate gyrus. Thus, we recommend to measure neuronal density in dentate gyrus using immunofluorescent staining with anti-NeuN antibody, combining with confocal imaging (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Neurodegeneration is a slowly progressive process during the development of Alzheimer’s disease in 5XFAD mice. Different experimenters will get different results on the numbers of degenerated neurons, apoptotic neurons or total neurons due to a lot of factors, such as the stage of the mice, the differences between staining reagents as well as the counting methods. However, it will not affect the conclusion on the difference of neuronal apoptosis or neuronal density between different groups, as long as you perform the staining and counting under the same condition and principle.</p>
<p>In our hands, the density of FJC-positive neurons is 30–40 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> in the cortex and hippocampus of 9-month-old 5XFAD mice. However, there is a few FJC-positive neurons, typically less than 1 cell/mm<sup>2</sup>, in cortex and hippocampus of WT mice, which can serve as a negative control to confirm the reliability of your staining result (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>In our experience, the ratio of cleaved caspase-3 positive neurons is 10%–15% in the cortex of 9-month-old 5XFAD mice, versus 2%–4% in 9-month-old WT mice. However, the percentage of cleaved caspase-3 positive neurons in dentate gyrus is relatively low, with a ratio of 1.5%–2% in 9-month-old 5XFAD mice and 0.2%–0.5% in age-matched WT mice.</p>
<p>9-month-old 5XFAD mice exhibit significant neuronal loss in cortical layer 5 and subiculum compared with WT control mice (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). The neuronal density in cortical layer 5 is about 1,500 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> in WT mice, but it drops to about 1,200 cell/mm<sup>2</sup> in 9-month-old 5XFAD mice. Similarly, the neuronal density in subiculum is about 2,500 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> in WT mice, but it significantly drops to about 1,000 cell/mm<sup>2</sup> in 9-month-old 5XFAD mice.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>The experimenters should be blinded to genotype when taking pictures for microscopic analysis. For each mouse brain sample, three to five serial sections should be stained for each experiment, and entire brain region should be pictured for quantification. At least four to six fields per section need to be randomly pictured for quantification if the whole-brain imaging cannot be achieved due to the limitation of the microscopes. Comparison between two groups should be analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s <i>t</i>-test and comparison among over three groups should be analyzed by one- or two-way ANOVA test depending on the treatment on mouse models.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol provides detailed methods to assess neurodegenerative phenotypes in aged 5XFAD mice from neurodegeneration, neuronal apoptosis to final neuronal loss. But this protocol does not evaluate glial markers of neurodegenerative processes (such as GFAP and Iba1 staining) and thus purely focuses on neuronal based analyses. Even though Fluro-Jade C is a specific neurodegenerative marker, the reason why Fluro-Jade C can specifically label degenerated neurons still unclear. In addition, using cleaved caspase-3 antibody to detect neuronal apoptosis remain controversial, as caspase-3 activation might be involved in synaptic function in the adult brain (<a href="#bib2">Snigdha et al., 2012</a>), thus methods that can detect neuronal apoptotic bodies and/or chromatin condensation, which are more proximal to death by apoptosis, need to be developed. Nissl staining is a widely used method to measure neuronal density. Nissl staining is very easy, cheap and timesaving, but the specificity of neuronal labeling is low as other cell types such as glial cells can also be stained by Cresyl violet, it takes some time to distinguish neurons from other cells when analyzing. By contrast, NeuN (or MAP2) staining is more specific than Nissl staining and contributes to more accurate results. All three staining methods are necessary when analyzing neuronal degeneration and death resulted from neuronal apoptosis, but only Fluro-Jade C and Nissl staining are required when you study other mechanisms of neuronal death.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The brain sections cannot recover to normal shape after FJC staining (step 2d).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Increase the recovering time in 1× PBS and change the 1× PBS for several times.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>High green background of FJC staining when imaging using microscope (step 3a).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Wash brain sections with ddH2O for more times and extend the time for washing after FJC staining to remove extra FJC solution completely.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Weak or no signal of cleaved caspase-3 (step 17).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Increase the concentration of anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody to 1:50.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Over- or under-staining of Nissl (step 21).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Always check the intensity of Nissl staining after submerging in 95% EtOH. If brain sections are over-stained, increase the time of immersion in differentiation solution (95% ethanol containing 0.7% glacial acetic acid) to 1.5–2 min. If brain sections are under-stained, decrease the time of immersion in differentiation solution to 10–30 s or skip differentiation.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>There are many small holes in the brain slices when imaging (step 24).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Increase the time of dehydration of mouse brain in 30% sucrose solution. Insufficient dehydration usually causes the formation of ice crystal, which can destroy the normal structure of brain.</p>
