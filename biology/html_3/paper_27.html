<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We present a reproducible protocol for fabrication of polyacrylamide (PAA) hydrogel-based nano-patterns and nano-textures with a wide range of elastic rigidities to study fundamental cell behaviors, such as mechanosensitivity and motility. We explore the benefits of this protocol by successfully testing the compatibility of the PAA platforms with super-resolution microscopy, which is largely unavailable with platforms of nano-scale textures made from different polymers. We also utilized soft and rigid nano-textures to study the mechanosensing basis of T cell behavior and phenotype.</p>
<p>For complete information on the generation and use of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib10">Tabdanov et al. (2018b)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Prior to beginning the nano-texture or nano-pattern manufacturing session, the basic consumables for the protocols need to be prepared and inventorized. Each of the consumables is described and its formulation listed in this section.</p>
<h3>Polyacrylamide Elastic Gels (PAA Gels) Formulations for Projected Shear Modulus G′</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–2 h</div>
<p>The final mechanical rigidity of the cured polyacrylamide elastic gels (PAA gels) is controlled via modulation of concentration for both 40% acrylamide (40% AA) base (BioRad) and its cross-linking molecular chain, 2% bis-AA (BioRad) in the PAA premixes, as described elsewhere (<a href="#bib2">Fischer et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib4">Plotnikov et al., 2014</a>), see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<li>In addition, streptavidin-acrylamide (Thermo Fisher) is added to a final concentration of 0.133 mg/mL to enable PAA gels cross-linking with biotinylated proteins of interest.</li>
<li>
<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> describes the components required for preparation of 50 μL of G’ at varying rigidities.</li>
<li>The premix solutions can be stored for several hours at +4°C before use.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Ammonium persulfate solution should be added immediately before PAA polymerization step.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> To ensure a proper PAA polymerization into the textured surfaces, the PAA premixes must be properly degassed in a vacuum chamber (vacuum bell connected to the centralized laboratory vacuum line) for 1 hour and/or in an ultrasonication degassing water bath (Cole-Parmer ultrasonic cleaner with timer and temperature control, Model 8891, Cole-Parmer, USA) for 5-6 minutes at 37°C prior to the nano-texture casting procedure. Since degassing and/or ultrasonication may affect TEMED stability and concentration, it is recommended to add TEMED to the PAA premixes after the degassing session.</div>
<h3>Preparation of Protein of Interest</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 9–13 h</div>
<p>Many proteins of interest cannot be directly printed using soft lithography methods, either because of the protein denaturation susceptibility (e.g., ICAM1) or the protein supramolecular assembly and/or polymerization (e.g., collagen type-1). To resolve this problem during the lithographic nano-printing phase, we substitute the protein of interest with non-blocking antibody “substitutes”, specific against the desired proteins of interest.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Here, we substituted collagen with α-collagen-1 rabbit pAb (AbCam, Cambridge, UK), conjugated with biotin to ensure cross-linking of the antibody to PAA gels and with Alexa Fluor™ fluorescent tag for fluorescence visibility.</li>
<li>For ICAM1 or E-cadherin nano-pattern functionalization, we first nano-patterned fluorescently-labeled and biotinylated Fab fragments of anti-Fc<sub>γ</sub> antibody.</li>
<li>The prepared nano-patterns were then incubated for 8-24 hours with rat monomeric collagen type-I (Corning, NY) or with commercially developed recombinant human chimeric ICAM1-Fc or E-cadherin protein (Sino Biological, China).</li>
<li>Incubate 20 μL of 1 mg/mL antibody for 1 hour with 5 μL of ((+)-biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma-Aldrich; as per the commercial protocol) and 5 μL of fluorescent tag kit (Alexa Fluor® succinimidyl esters of desired excitation/emission spectrum, Invitrogen™, Molecular Probes®; as per the commercial protocol).</li>
<li>Dialyze labeled antibody in Slide-A-Lyzer™ MINI Dialysis Device, 7K MWCO (Thermo Fisher) for 8-12 hours at +4°C in cold PBS, then stored at +4°C in the dark.</li>
</ol>
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause Point:</span> At this point, the protein of interest can be stored at +4°C in the dark for several months.</div>
<h3>Formulation and Preparation of Regular and Hard PDMS</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>To prepare regular PDMS (rPDMS), mix 1:5 curing agent/base ratio mixture formulation (Sylgard-184, Dow Corning). Remove the air bubble inclusions in the viscous rPDMS premix by centrifugation at 400 g for 3 minutes at +4°C.</li>
<li>To prepare hard PDMS (hPDMS), mix VDT-731 (Gelest, Inc.), Pt catalyst (Platinum(0)- 2,4,6,8 -tetramethyl-2,4,6,8-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane complex solution) (Sigma-Aldrich), cross-linking modulator (2,4,6,8-Tetramethyl-2,4,6,8-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane) (Sigma-Aldrich), and HMS-301 (Gelest, Inc.) in the minimum amounts as described in <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>. Details on the formulation for hPDMS is described elsewhere (<a href="#bib3">Odom et al., 2002</a>).</li>

<p>To test the high precision 2D nano-patterns, we utilized the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-468 (ATCC® HTB-132™). To test the elastic nano-textured patterns we utilized the human CD4+ T cells were generated from the human whole peripheral blood (STEMCELL™ Technologies Inc., USA).</p>
<p>For microprinting, we used Alexa Fluor™ 568 fluorophore- and biotin-prelabeled anti-collagen rabbit pAb, and Alexa Fluor™ 488 fluorophore- and biotin-prelabeled Fab fragments of anti-Fc<sub>γ</sub> antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch), ICAM1-Fc (Sino Biological, China), human E-cadherin-Fc chimeric protein (Sino Biological, China), collagen type-I (Corning, NY).</p>
<p>For imaging, F-actin was stained with either fluorescent phalloidin (Alexa Fluor™ phalloidin conjugates, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or SiR-Actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.), chromatin was labeled with Hoechst solution (Tocris, USA).</p>

<section>
<h2 id="step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-Step Method Details</h2>
<h3>Part A. Preparation of Elastic Nano-textured Patterns</h3>
<p>The soft elastically deformable PAA-based nano-textures are manufactured by confining the polymerizing PAA premixes (of chosen shear modulus G’ formulation) with molding negative replica of the desired nano-texture design. The cross-linking between biotin and streptavidin is used to functionalize the PAA surfaces with a protein of interest. Streptavidin is introduced directly into PAA premix (see <a href="#before-you-begin">Before You Begin</a> for more details) as a streptavidin-acrylamide (streptavidin-AA) conjugate (Thermo Fisher) whereas biotin ester tags (Sigma-Aldrich) the protein of interest (See <a href="#before-you-begin">Before You Begin</a> for more details). The negative molding replica used for molding confinement is precoated with biotin-tagged protein of interest for better efficiency of protein-PAA cross-linking. Optionally, protein of interest is also pre-labeled with a fluorescent tag for further nano-texture visualization (See <a href="#before-you-begin">Before You Begin</a> for more details).</p>
<h4>Manufacturing PAA Molding Casts</h4>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>This section describes the generation of molding casts - negative PDMS replicas of the substrate topography prototype (positive master) used for casting the PAA nano-textured surfaces.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> As a positive master, we use either the pre-passivated silicon-crystal matrix (UMN NanoCenter, MN, USA), fabricated via photoresist development method <b>(</b><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A, <b>step 1)</b> or textured polyurethane nano-surfaces (NanoSurface Biomedical, Seattle, WA), glued onto the glass slide with SuperGlue® (Loctite, USA) and passivated with silanization solution-I (Sigma-Aldrich) as per <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product_Information_Sheet/1/sl2pis.pdf">commercial protocol</a>.</div>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Fabrication of the Elastic Polyacrylamide Protein-Functionalized Nano-Topographies</div>
<p>(A) Passivated mold (matrix) with nano-features is either prepared commercially via conventional photoresist silicone crystal development or assembled from the polyurethane nano-surfaces (Nanosurface Biomedical, Seattle) by gluing the circular nano-features surfaces to the glass-slide with the following silanization in Silanization Solution-I (Sigma-Aldrich) (1).</p>
<p>(B) Casting hPDMS-based mold: hPDMS premix 5 μL droplet (2 - arrowhead) is “sandwiched” between baked (450°C) plasma-treated cover-glass and the molding matrix (3 - dashed contour) to a submillimeter thickness. hPDMS in the “sandwich” is cured at ∼70°C, 30 minutes, then peeled from the casting surface together with cover-glass (4), and cut in ∼1 cm<sup>2</sup> square pieces (5).</p>
<p>(C) hPDMS molds placed “face-up” atop of the regular PDMS blocks (rPDMS pedestal) (6) to stick and immobilize the pieces. 5-7 μL droplet of the fluorescently labeled biotinylated 200 mg/mL protein of interest solution is “sandwiched” between the hPDMS molding surface and clean pre-baked coverglass (7-8).</p>
<p>(D) ∼7 μL of PAA premix droplet is “sandwiched” between 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate-coated glass-bottom of 35 mm Petri dish and rinsed and dried protein-coated hPDMS mold (9-10 - hPDMS is oriented “face-down” toward the PAA). After 5 minutes the cured PAA “sandwich” is incubated in deionized water or Q-water for 30 minutes at 20-25°C or at +4°C for 8-24 hours. Glass-bottom Petri dishes with Q-water then placed into ultrasonication chamber for 10-30 seconds to release the hPDMS molds from the PAA gel (11). If hPDMS mold is not released on its own, gently peel the mold manually (12). The nano-textured soft PAA surface is examined for the quality and defects via 3D microscopy (13).</p>

The dome-like (i.e. spherical or bi-axial) deformation allows for an effective, yet gentle peeling of the molding nano-surface off the molded nano-textured PAA gel surfaces.</li>

<h3>Part B. Preparation of High Precision 2D Nano-patterns</h3>
<p>Nano-patterns provide a powerful tool to study directed migration (<a href="#bib5">Ray et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib10">Taddanov et al, 2018b</a>). However, fabrication of flat elastic nano-patterns by the traditional soft lithography methods is a challenging task due to the suboptimal size of the printing bas-relief features of the nano-stamp. To address these issues and achieve high precision and definition for the resulting nano-patterns on elastic platforms we substituted regular soft PDMS (rPDMS) nano-stamps with the composite stamps. We combined soft cushioning rPDMS block with a veneering submillimeter-thick layer of hard PDMS (hPDMS, See <a href="#before-you-begin">Before You Begin</a> for more details) that features rigid non-collapsing printing bas-relief nano-features ( <a href="#bib6">Schmid and Michel, 2000</a>; <a href="#bib7">Shen et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib8">Tabdanov et al., 2015</a>). Thus, in this design, a soft rPDMS cushioning layer provides an even pressure distribution onto the hPDMS printing veneer for the even lithographic contact with the printed surface, while the submillimeter thickness of the non-collapsing printing layer prevents the effects of hPDMS fragility.</p>

<p>(A) Preparation of the composite nano-stamp: thin submillimeter layer of hPDMS premix is spread atop of the molding matrix passivated surface (manually or by spin-coating), cured at ∼70°C for 30 minutes. Regular PDMS (rPDMS) premix layer is poured at the top of the hPDMS layer to the final stamp thickness of ∼7 mm and consequently cured at ∼7°C for 1 hour. Cured composite PDMS is gently peeled off the matrix (1) and cut in ∼0.5-1 cm<sup>2</sup> pieces (2, 3). For the composite double protein nano-grids printing, prepare 2 rectangular cover-glasses and label them as shown on (4).</p>
<p>(B) Composite nano-stamps are coated with 5-7 μL of protein of interest (200 mg/mL, fluorescent, biotinylated) by “sandwiching” the protein solution between the stamp’s surface and clean coverglass in the wet chember (3) for at least 40 minutes at 20-25°C or at +4°C for 8-12 hours. Protein-coated, rinsed and dried nano-stamps are placed on the rectangular cover-glass (5) and aligned to the cover-glass’ edges either vertically or horizontally (6).</p>
<p>(C) Clean dust-free cover-glass (“intermediate surface”) pieces are immobilized on the glass-slides with the Scotch-Tape™ (7). The protein-coated nano-stamp is gently placed with its printing surface facing the “intermediate” surface cover-glass, in one-touch movement with holding coverglass edges aligned to the glass-slide edges (8). A weight (∼100 g) is placed atop of the nano-stamp to ensure a proper nano-contact stamping.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For the convenience the weight’s bottom must be wet to ensure easy removal of the weigh together with the nano-stamp in one movement (9). For the dual protein grid printing, repeat steps 4-9 with the second protein of interest and nano-lines orientation orthogonal to the orientation of the previously printed nanolines.</div>
<p>(D) 5-7 μL of PAA premix (10) of desired projected rigidity is “sandwiched” between 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate-coated glass-bottom of 35 mm Petri dish and nano-patterned “intermediate” surface, facing the PAA solution (11), to ensure submillimeter thickness of PAA gel. After gel polymerization (∼5 minutes) the Petri dish is filled with Q-water for 30 minutes at 20-25°C or at +4°C for 8-24 hours (12).</p>

<p>The following proceedings are the final product testing protocols and demonstration of compatible cells morphometric measurements.</p>
<h3>Cell Adhesion and Spreading Assay, Samples Preparation</h3>
<p>We utilized the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-468 (ATCC® HTB-132™) as a model system to test both cell-ECM type adhesion to collagen type-1 nano-patterns, and biomimetic cell-cell type adhesion to E-cadherin nano-lines. For details, please refer to this <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31460-8">Cell Reports paper.</a></p>
<p>Human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were generated from the human whole peripheral blood (STEMCELL™ Technologies Inc., USA) as a model system for sterically active substrates recognition and interaction via LFA1-ICAM1 adhesion. For cell culture experiments, T cells were maintained in ImmunoCult™-XF T Cell Expansion Medium (STEMCELL™ Technologies Inc., USA) with the addition of Human Recombinant Interleukin 2 (IL-2, STEMCELL™ Technologies Inc., USA) as per STEMCELL™ Technologies Inc. as specified by the commercial protocol. After cell adhesion and spreading assay (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37°C, 2 hours) samples were fixed with cold DMEM with 4% PFA for 15 minutes, followed by rinsing incubation in 1% BSA PBS. F-actin was stained with either fluorescent phalloidin (Alexa Fluor™ phalloidin conjugates, Thermo Fisher Scientific; 10 U/mL in 1% BSA PBS) or SiR-Actin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.;1 μM in 1% BSA PBS for 1 hour). Chromatin was labeled with 1:1000 Hoechst solution (Tocris, USA). All cell work was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Biosafety Committee and followed institutional and NIH guidelines.</p>
<h3>High-Resolution Imaging</h3>
<p>High-resolution 2D and 3D imaging, images reconstruction and linear image parametric adjustments were performed as described previously. Figures were composed using unmodified NIS-Elements AR-generated TIFF images with Adobe Illustrator CC 2017 (Adobe Systems, Inc.).

<h3>Super-Resolution Imaging (Contact Guidance of Human T Cells on Nano-textured Surface)</h3>
<p>Super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy was performed using a commercial Leica SP8 STED 3X system (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany), equipped with a white light laser with continuous spectral output between the wavelengths of 470 nm to 670 nm, and a 592 nm, 660 nm and a pulsed 775 nm STED depletion lasers, to obtain time-gated STED images on 3 hybrid detectors. We have used initially for imaging the STED white objective 100x/1.4 NA oil immersion objective lens (HCX PL APO STED white, Leica Microsystems). Given the complexity and varying depth of the sample, the STED WHITE Glycerin objective lens (HC PL APO 93X/1.30 GLYC motCORR) (Leica Microsystems) was more advantageous for depth imaging due to the motorized correction collar allowing precise and swift adjustment of optical lenses to specimen inhomogeneity. Labeled samples placed in 35 mm culture dishes with number 1.5 cover glass bottom (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) containing 250 μl glycerol (90%) in PBS were imaged in sequentially as follows: first sequence STED for SiR-actin (via 647 nm excitation and 660- 730 nm emission range) on gated ( 0.7- 6.5 ns time gating) hybrid detector using 775 nm (25% power) as STED depletion laser for best lateral resolution; Second and third sequences were confocal settings for Hoechst and Alexa488 (labeling nucleus and surface of the gel) respectively, via two sequential excitations (405 nm, and 488 nm) and two emission ranges (410-465 nm, and 495-555 nm) respectively, on gated (0.3-6.5 ns) hybrid detectors. Imaging was performed with a scan speed of 600 lines per second, scanning bidirectionally, a pixel size of 30-35 nm (1024 x 1024 pixels), and 6-line averages, pinhole of 0.7 Airy units and Z-stacks were collected at 0.140 μm-depth intervals throughout the depth of the sample. We deconvoluted images using Huygens Professional software version 18.10.0 (SVI, Hilversum, NL) with the classical maximum likelihood estimation algorithm. We then inspected and reconstructed 3D data using Clear Volume plugin (FIJI). Still frames were saved and montaged using Adobe Photoshop CC.</p>
<h3>T Cell On-Ridge Spreading and In-Groove Invasiveness Is Controlled by the Mechanical Rigidity of ICAM1-Coated Nano-topography</h3>
<p>Human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell behavior on topographical features can be captured on nano-textured PAA gels (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A) with super-resolution STED microscopy (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B), which are unavailable commercially compared to manufactured plastic nano-textures, and provide much needed mechanical control of T cell motility analysis. We demonstrate the ability to perform morphometric analysis of T cell motility on soft ICAM1-coated nano-textures, such as T cell height and projected 2D spreading area (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C and 3D). Along with the basic morphometric analysis, we are able to decipher structurally finer T cell invasiveness features that penetrate into the nano-grooves as a function of the nano-texture mechanical rigidity (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D). We demonstrate ICAM1 rigidity-controlled T cell spreading-invasion dynamics, finding the mechanically controlled balance between the flat lamellipodium-driven <i>on-ridge</i> T cell spreading and <i>in-groove</i> steric invasiveness (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D and 3E) that may help to increase T cell contact guidance in the soft, but not rigid environments.</p>

<p>(D and E) Mechanoregulation of T cell height, spreading area and invasiveness as indicated by T cell spreading assay on soft (G’=16 kPa) and rigid (G’=50 kPa) ICAM1 nano-textures. T cell spreading enhances on the rigid ICAM1, accompanied with T cell flattening, i.e. decrease of the T cell height. Results indicate a mechanically controlled dynamic balance between <i>on-ridge</i> T cell spreading and <i>in-groove</i> invasiveness, as shown on the schematic panel (E). I.e. T cell <i>in-groove</i> invasiveness structurally competes with <i>on-ridge</i> spreading, indicating that <i>on-ridge</i> spreading is mechanically enhanced and out-balances <i>in-groove</i> invasiveness on the rigid (G’=50 kPa) ICAM1 nano-topography. Alternatively, soft (G’=16 kPa) ICAM-1 nano-textures are unable to promote the mechanically sensitive <i>on-ridge</i> T cell spreading, shifting the balance towards steric <i>in-groove</i> T cell invasiveness.</p>

<h3>Adenocarcinoma Cells Spreading on Bi-axially Heterogeneous and Anisotropic Nano-grids</h3>
<p><i>In vivo</i>, cells frequently encounter simultaneous synergistic or competing adhesion cues from cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions that can be studied <i>in vitro</i> (<a href="#bib1">Borghi et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib9">Tabdanov et al., 2018a</a>). Human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-468) demonstrate overall bi-axially continuous protrusion on the ‘collagen type-1 vs. E-cadherin’ nano-grids (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A) on both soft (G’=2.3 kPa) and rigid (G’=50 kPa) mechanical platforms. The morphometric analysis reveals an overall mechanically controlled bi-axial spreading (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B and 4C). However, we observe no differential preference or spreading competition between either of the ligands nanolines directions on both soft and rigid substrates. Therefore, we hypothesize that at the nanoscale the adenocarcinoma cells are unable to robustly spatially resolve the directionality and spatial organization of the flat anisotropic guidance cues, as opposed to the previously reported dynamic and mechanically controlled MDA-MB-468 cell protrusion competition between microscale (1-15 μm) collagen-1 and E-cadherin anisotropic cues directionalities, additionally modulated by the mechanical rigidity of the adhesion-motility platforms (<a href="#bib9">Tabdanov et al., 2018a</a>). Thus, we suggest the utilization of our experimental platforms for the further investigation of cell contact guidance cues sensing on the nanoscale and in correlation with mechanobiological aspects of cell-microenvironment interactions.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Both described methods have limitations at the lithographic nano-printing or nano-molding step, specifically, although hPDMS, due to its mechanical rigidity, allows one to eliminate the problem of nano-textured surface collapse onto the printed surface, such collapse-resistance exists within a limited range of the geometrical dimensions of the printing bas-relief. Although we have not explored such dimension limitations, we suggest that it may take place at the bas-relief dimensions below 50-100 nm. Similarly, we predict nano-molding limitations at the molding bas-relief dimension below 50-100 nm, as at this size range the oxygen diffusion-related effects may prevent the proper replication of the molding nano-texture by polymerizing PAA gel surface.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Patterns are inactive due to protein denaturation or the protein supramolecular assembly and/or polymerization during printing.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Substitute the protein of interest with non-blocking antibody “substitutes”, specific against the desired proteins of interest (see <a href="#before-you-begin">Before You Begin</a> for more details).</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>PAA gel detaches from glass-bottom dishes.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Activate glass-bottom dishes with methacrylate immediately before use (See <a href="#before-you-begin">Before You Begin</a> for more details).</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Peeling causes structural damage to the PAA nano-texture surface.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Use hypotonic swelling, apply pressure in the middle of the glass-bottom of the Petri dish from outside to generate the dome-like glass-bottom surface deformation for better release. Use ultrasonication for peeling. Repeat the PAA premix degassing procedure before casting the PAA.</p>
