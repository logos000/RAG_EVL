<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>TNF-induced necroptosis is involved in many physiological and pathological processes. Phospho-MLKL is a hallmark of necroptosis. Cecum is a sensitive organ with extensive necroptosis responses to TNF <i>in vivo</i>. Here, taking advantage of commercially available mouse TNF and easily accessible reagents and materials, we systematically provide a detailed and highly versatile protocol of detecting necroptosis signaling in mouse cecum by immunohistochemical labeling, which can also be used in other tissues or antibodies in immunohistochemical staining.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Yang et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="#bib1">Chen et al. (2015)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">TNF injection</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15–30 min</div>
<ol>
<li>Use syringe (1 mL, 25 G) to inject appropriate mouse TNF into the experimental mice through tail vein (i.v) (Critical 1, 2).</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> (1) Intravenous injection requires proficient skills. You need to take more practices before the experiments to avoid injecting drugs into muscle or connective tissues. A suitable volume for intravenous injection is about 200 μL/mice, and TNF can be diluted with PBS or saline. (2) In our lab, mice are injected intravenously with 300 mg/kg TNF (75 mg/mL) diluted in endotoxin free PBS. (<a href="#sec6.1">Troubleshooting 1</a>)</div>

<h3 id="sec3.2">Tissue fixation and sectioning</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ≈2 days</div>
<ol>
<li>Generally, cecum samples are harvested at 8 h after TNF injection.</li>
<li>Cut the cecum from mouse. Place tissue sample into a labeled 10-mL-tube containing 8 mL 4% paraformaldehyde to fix, and put these tubes on a shaker by 220 rpm shaking for 24–48 h at room temperature (25°C) (critical 1, 2, 3).</li>
<li>Cut the fixed cecum open to let all the feces out, and put the cleaned cecum into an embedding cassette, and label it clearly with pencil. (<a href="#sec6.3">Troubleshooting 2</a>)</li>
<li>Transfer tissue cassettes to the Semi-enclosed Benchtop Tissue Processor for dehydration: incubate sequentially in 50%, 70%, 80%, 95% v/v ethanol in water for 25 min each, in 95% v/v ethanol in water twice for 15 min each, in 100% v/v ethanol in water twice for 30 min each, in ethanol and xylene mixture (1:1 v/v) for 30 min, and then in xylene twice for 20 min each. Perform all the incubation processes at room temperature (25°C).</li>
<li>Infiltrate tissues in processor with paraplast tissue embedding medium twice at 60°C for 1.5 h.</li>
<li>Select an appropriately sized embedding mold and add molten embedding medium from the embedding workstation so that the mold is approximately three quarters full.</li>
<li>Use warmed forceps to transfer the infiltrated tissue into the mold, and then place the mold on the 5°C cold plate of the embedding workstation. Use warmed forceps to keep the tissue in the desired orientation and press the tissue gently to make sure that all the air in the tissue is excluded before the paraffin cools and anchors the tissue in place.</li>
<li>Place the labeled tissue cassette lid over the top of the mold and dispense sufficient embedding medium over the lid to fill the mold. Transfer the mold and its lid to the 5°C cold plate for 10 min or until the paraffin has hardened enough for manual release of the tissue block from the base mold.</li>

(4) It is very important to absorb all the water under the tissue otherwise the tissue may detach from the slide under these following steps.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.3">Deparaffinization and immunohistochemistry</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ≈2 days</div>

<li>Deparaffinization: incubate three times in xylene for 10 min each, twice in 100% ethanol for 10 min each, 90% v/v ethanol in water for 5 min, 80% v/v ethanol in water for 5 min, 70% v/v ethanol in water for 5 min, and last wash three times for 5 min each by ddwater.</li>
<li>Perform antigen retrieval: put the slide in the antigen retrieval buffer in a pressure cooker, and make sure the whole tissue is embedded in the buffer. Put the pressure cooker on an electromagnetic oven, and heat it under 1800 W. After the cooker begins to vent, start timing for 1.5 min and then let the cooker cool to room temperature naturally (critical 1, 2, 3).</li>
<li>After antigen retrieval, use a Super PAP Pen to draw a circle around the tissue, and all the following regents and antibodies except the wash buffer are added in the circle (critical 4).</li>
<li>Then, slides are washed three times for 5 min on a shaker under 220 rpm condition and then incubated in 50 μL 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> v/v in ddwater for 5 min at room temperature (25°C).</li>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> (1) The concentration and pH of the antigen retrieval buffer are critical. The wrong concentration and pH may cause very strong false positive signaling! (<a href="#sec6.5">Troubleshooting 3</a>) (2) Please count the time of antigen retrieval when the pressure cooker begins to vent. (3) The time course of antigen retrieval is also very important to expose antigenic sites, because too long or too short exposure will cause false positive signaling or signaling loss. (4) The circle drawn around the tissue should not get too close to the tissue or the edge of the tissue might not get enough nurturing of every treatment. (5) When you develop phospho-MLKL, you should do it under the microscope to check the developing status. When you see the signaling of phospho-MLKL, stop the time of development. Generally, it takes 2 min. (<a href="#sec6.7">Troubleshooting 4</a> and <a href="#sec6.9">5</a>) (6) To exclude the air between the slide and cover slips, you must avoid pressing the tissue too hard which may cause artificial damage to the tissue. (7) The signaling of phospho-MLKL will appear in these damage areas, as described in <a href="#sec6.7">Troubleshooting 4</a> and <a href="#sec6.9">5</a>.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The cecum was damaged when injected with TNF. As <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows, we can find submucosa edema, desquamation, and epithelial sloughing in the cecum. The signaling of phospho-MLKL was in the epithelial cell.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Depending on the cytotoxicity of TNF and environmental impact on mice, you may have to modify the amount of mouse TNF injected, the time of getting cecum sample and of developing phospho-MLKL. The volume of TNF is 150 μL to 300 μL.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Described below are some potential problems and recommendations for troubleshooting.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Why do the mice resist to mouse TNF injection?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, check the housing condition of the mice. All the mice should be fed in SPF condition. Second, you can use L929 or other cell line that are sensitive to TNF-induced cell death to check the cytotoxicity of TNF. Third, dilute the TNF when you inject it to the mice, because long-term exposure of TNF at room temperature (25°C) may decrease the cytotoxicity of TNF.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>How do I get the faces out of the cecum after fixation?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Owing to the structure of cecum, it has two blind ends. After fixation, the cecum became very solid and you can cut the two ends (each about 10% of cecum) of the cecum. Then, use scissors to cut the cecum open from its ileocecal flap to its own blind end and forceps to clamp and shake the cecum slowly to let all the faces out.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Why can I not get the pH of citrate antigen retrieval buffer to 6.0?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The pH of antigen retrieval buffer is very sensitive, so you can get 490 mL ddwater in the bottle, then add 20 μL 1 N HCl each time to adjust the pH meanwhile using a magnet rotor to let the HCl dissolve quickly and equally in the buffer. When the pH approaches 6.0, you shall become more careful and add 1 N HCl more slowly and wait till the pH becomes stable and decide to add the HCl or not. Generally, 2–3 mL 1 N HCl is enough to adjust the pH to 6.0 in 500 mL Citrate antigen retrieval buffer. Finally, when the pH value becomes 6.0, add 250 μL Tween-20 and meter volume to 500 mL by ddwater.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Why do I get so many false positive signaling in the cecum after TNF injection?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If you have many false positive signaling, you can try the following methods. First, you shall ensure the concentration and pH of Citrate antigen retrieval buffer. Second, the time course of antigen retrieval must be 1.5 min, because too long or too short time of antigen retrieval will cause false positive signaling. Third, you can reduce the concentration of phospho-MLKL or the developing time of DAB.</p>

<p>Why cannot I get any signaling in the cecum after TNF injection?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, the damage of the cecum should be observed when TNF had been injected for 8 h. If there is no damage, it means your TNF is not working and please check its cytotoxicity activity as described in problem 1. Second, if there is too much damage of the cecum, it will also make the phospho-MLKL lost. If so, you can collect the samples earlier or reduce the amount of TNF that is injected into the mice. Third, you can also increase antibody concentration of phospho-MLKL. Fourth, you can recheck your antigen retrieval condition, because insufficient exposure of antigenic sites may cause the defect of phospho-MLKL signaling. Fifth, increase the developing time of DAB.</p>
