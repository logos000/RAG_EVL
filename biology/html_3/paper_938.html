<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. Endothelial cells (ECs) produce most ATP through glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation; thus mitochondrial ROS production is lower than in other cell types. This makes quantification of changes in EC mitochondrial oxidative status challenging. Here, we present an optimized protocol using mitochondrial-targeted adenovirus-based redox sensor for ratiometric quantification of specific changes in mitochondrial ROS in live human coronary artery EC.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol describes adenoviral transduction, live-cell imaging, and quantification of mitochondrial oxidative status in primary culture of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), using a mitochondrial-targeted and redox sensitive fluorescent marker known as mito-roGFP. The protocol requires the administration of dithiothreitol and hydrogen peroxide during live-cell imaging to measure a time-lapse of maximum reduction and oxidation, respectively, and obtain a ratiometric scale to thereby calculate percent of oxidation. This protocol has also been validated with primary culture of mouse heart endothelial cells. While this protocol is designed to study mitochondrial oxidative status of endothelial cells (EC), it can also be adapted for use with other cell types.</p>
<p>Impaired NO bioavailability in ECs leads to endothelial dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis (<a href="#bib14">Indik, Goldman and Gaballa, 2001</a>; <a href="#bib5">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#bib8">Feng et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib11">Gimbrone and García-Cardeña, 2016</a>; <a href="#bib21">Shafique et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib25">Zimmer et al., 2021</a>). In endothelial dysfunction, there is an excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to oxidative and nitrosative damage that contribute to the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease (<a href="#bib5">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#bib21">Shafique et al., 2017</a>). Thus, limiting oxidative stress has long been sought as an approach to restore endothelial and cardiac function in humans with cardiovascular complications. However, global antioxidant therapies have interestingly failed to improve outcomes in clinical settings (<a href="#bib1">Bjelakovic et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#bib2">Bjelakovic, Nikolova and Gluud, 2013</a>). These findings necessitated the study of subcellular ROS, particularly of mitochondrial ROS, to restore mitochondrial function (<a href="#bib4">Brown et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib21">Shafique et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib17">Kiyuna et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib12">Hamedani et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Several fluorescent-labeled probes, such as Mito-SOX, have been developed to allow for mitochondrial ROS measurement (<a href="#bib6">Cheng et al., 2018</a>). However, as EC produce most (more than 80%) of their ATP via glycolysis rather than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, the resulting low levels of mitochondrial ROS pose a challenge in the reproducibility of results using such probes in ECs (<a href="#bib3">De Bock et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib9">Fitzgerald, Soro-Arnaiz and De Bock, 2018</a>). The redox sensor mito-roGFP is advantageous as it allows for specific measurement of mitochondrial ROS. Mito-roGFP is a redox-sensitive, ratiometric fluorescent protein sensor targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (<a href="#bib23">Waypa et al., 2010</a>). Unlike other sensors, the fluorescence excitation spectrum of roGFP is strongly and reversibly dependent on the redox state of the introduced cysteines (<a href="#bib13">Hanson et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bib23">Waypa et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, mito-roGFP has the greater advantage of allowing for live cell imaging and time-lapse measurements of cells’ response to diverse stimuli, e.g., hypoxia (refer to the third table under the materials and equipment section for more details). A number of research groups have studied redox state using mito-roGFP and optimized the protocol for their cell type of interest, which is summarized in the second table under the materials and equipment section. The different reagents and their amounts support that different cell types have different redox capacities, not only at the global level but the subcellular level as well. This understanding requires the use of cell-specific protocols and, to our knowledge, there is no established protocol for using mito-roGFP in primary HCAEC. This article aims to outline the materials and methods for using mito-roGFP to measure the mitochondrial redox state of HCAEC, which will help study and translation of new therapeutics for cardiovascular disease.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Isolation and amplification of Mito-roGFP</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4 weeks prior to transduction</div>
<ol>
<li>The mito-roGFP adenovirus is provided as a plasmid in bacteria as agar stab. Please follow steps for bacterial culture and plasmid DNA isolation, as per manufacturer instructions, available at: <a href="https://www.addgene.org/recipient-instructions/myplasmid/#:%7E:text=Bacterial%20Stabs,spreading%20it%20on%20the%20surface">https://www.addgene.org/recipient-instructions/myplasmid/#:∼:text=Bacterial%20Stabs,spreading%20it%20on%20the%20surface</a>. After DNA isolation, we suggest following the adenovirus amplification and storage protocol from abm, starting at step 2, available at: <a href="https://www.abmgood.com/pub/media/catalog/category/docs/a/4/A4-Ad-amplification-protocol.pdf">https://www.abmgood.com/pub/media/catalog/category/docs/a/4/A4-Ad-amplification-protocol.pdf</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Culture of HCAEC</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 week prior to transduction</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>HCAECs should be used between passages 4 and 7. Cells stored at passage 3, for example, should be thawed and cultured at least 1 week prior to the estimated date of transduction with replication-deficient mito-roGFP adenovirus.
<ol type="a">
<li>Prepare and aliquot all reagents (DPBS, growth media, trypsin and trypsin neutralizing solution).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Growth media is prepared by adding all reagents of the EGM-2 MV Bulletkit (1 × Bottle FBS, 25.00 mL; 1 × Natural Cap Vial with Hydrocortisone, 0.20 mL; 1 × Gray Cap Vial with hFGF-B, 2.00 mL; 1 × White Cap Vial with VEGF, 0.50 mL; 1 × Yellow Cap Vial with R3-IGF-1, 0.50 mL; 1 × Blue Cap Vial with Ascorbic Acid, 0.50 mL; 1 × Green Cap Vial with hEGF, 0.50 mL; 1 × Red Cap Vial with GA-1000, 0.50 mL) with the EBM-2 Basal Medium (500 ml). The Bulletkit and medium are included in the <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a> as one item, listed as EGM<sup>TM</sup> -2 MV Microvascular Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 BulletKit<sup>TM</sup>. After preparation, the EGM<sup>TM</sup> -2 MV Microvascular Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 BulletKit<sup>TM</sup> should be stored at 4°C degrees for no longer than 30 days.</div>
</li>
<li>Pipette 10 mL of pre-warmed growth media into a 10 cm culture plate. Thaw HCAEC vial by carefully dipping the bottom of the vial in a 37°C degree water bath until a little chunk of ice is left in the middle of the vial.
<ol type="i">
<li>Then, transfer the HCAECs from the vial to the plate, making sure that the cells are evenly distributed. Incubate HCAECs for 16 h in a cell culture incubator (37°C degree, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 85%–95% humidity).</li>
<li>Change the growth media after the 16 h incubation described in step 2.b.i. Subsequently, the media should be changed on alternate days, and cells should be 80% confluent at the day of splitting for the assay.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> All procedures for HCAEC culture must be carried out in a class II biological safety cabinet, to avoid contamination. Visualize your cells under the microscope on alternate days to confirm that they are healthy and free of contaminants before proceeding to the assay.</div>

Next, select FITC (488 nm) channel (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B, step 1). Input settings exactly as indicated in yellow square (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A, step 2). If setting the experiment for HCAEC, change the exposure value to 1 s, and to 200 milliseconds for Mito-roGFP and FITC channels, respectively. Note that exposure and gain may need to be later optimized for both 488 and 405 channels, according to your experimental conditions.</li>
<li>Confirm intervals and time for measurement (15 s interval, first loop 35 min, second loop 35 min). Check boxes and edit all fields exactly as indicated in the yellow box in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B, step 3.</li>
<li>Next, click on the “Define ratio…” button (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B, step 4). A new, small window will open (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C). Change the numerator to 405 nm and the denominator to 488 nm as indicated in square 1 of <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C.

<p>Addition of DTT will result in a color change at the ratio channel, from green (frame 12) to red (frame 13), as shown in (A). This color change can be used for corret seletion of the frame corresponding to maximal reduction (Frame 13). After addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the color will gradually change, as seen in frames 74 (before addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and 75 (after addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) of (B). However, it can take several minutes to reach full oxidation, which can be identified by the predominance of blue color (frame 94), as shown in (C). In this case, frame 94 corresponds to the maximum oxidation. After correct frame selection, the corresponding values can be used to calculate the % oxidized, as shown in (C). Note that ratio is shown as 488/405 nm. Scale bar represents 50 μm.</p>

<li>Next, look for the frame number that corresponds to the time you applied the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; e.g., if H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was added at around 18 min and 16 s, then frame 75 would be already a result of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> addition, and frames 13 through 74 would correspond to DTT readings.

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>One limitation of this protocol is that HCAECs tend to move upon addition of a reducing (DTT) or oxidizing (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) agent. For this reason, displaced ROIs will produce unreliable results and must be excluded from analysis. In addition, endothelial cells are resistant to oxidation by nature, which means they may take an extended time to achieve full oxidation following addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This is especially true when using antioxidants as a test treatment. Furthermore, although this protocol works in both highly reduced and highly oxidized samples, the concentration of DTT, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or TBH has to be optimized for both conditions. Finally, we note that it may not be possible to compare highly reduced versus highly oxidized samples as part of one single experiment as they will most likely require very different concentrations of DTT/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Cells are not fluorescent (not expressing roGFP) after transduction. This problem may arise at step 6f.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>HCAEC usually express a good level of roGFP 24 h after transduction. Depending on the cell type, e.g., murine EC, a longer incubation time (up to 72 h) may be required after the transduction procedure. In this case, change the media every day and examine the cells under the microscope with FITC filter to check for fluorescence signal. Alternatively, the adenovirus load may need to be increased to achieve the expected fluorescence, however the same concentration of adenovirus should be loaded in both control and test samples to account for changes in baseline ROS induced by the adenovirus transduction. Another solution is to repeat the amplification process or use a new stock vial or single aliquot as mito-roGFP may have been degraded by repeated freeze and thaw cycles. In case of unsuccessful optimization of this protocol in other cell types, we note that there are alternative options with lentivirus and retrovirus-associated mito-roGFP transduction that can access oxidized state of different mitochondrial systems, such as peroxisome and glutathione, some examples are summarized in a Table provided on the Mendeley Data.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>ECs are not predominantly exhibiting green color in the 405/488 ratio channel, or the ratio is not close to 1 when starting the acquisition of the standard/control sample. This problem may arise at step 6f.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Adjust the exposure and gain of the 488 and 405 nm channels to a similar level of fluorescence between both channels (please note that the same settings must be used for all samples).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Cells do not change color to purple nor red with the addition of DTT or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively. This problem may arise at steps 7a and 8a.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Increase the concentration of DTT or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> until you visualize adequate color change without losing the ROIs. As an alternative, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may be replaced by tBH. Although we found inconsistent results using tBH, prior research has shown successful results in other cell types (please refer to the second table under the <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section). Please refer to the notebook notes available on Mendeley dataset for an example of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration troubleshooting. Note that more oxidized samples will require a higher concentration of DTT (to fully reduce the sensor) and, consequently, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (to fully oxidize the sensor), and more reduced samples may require a lower concentration of DTT and, consequently, of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2.</sub></p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Cells shrink and wash away when adding DTT or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2.</sub> This problem may arise at steps 7 and 8.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Reduce the concentration of DTT or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> until you visualize adequate color change without losing the ROIs.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Color of cells at the ratio channel suddenly changes without addition of chemicals. This problem may arise at any step during image acquisition at day three.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This may happen due to an error during filter change. Annotate the frame number and exclude that frame from analysis. Observe the cells to see if filters will correctly change in the next frame. If error continues, the recording will have to be restarted. In addition, the interval between filter change may have to be increased depending on the capacity of your imaging system.</p>
