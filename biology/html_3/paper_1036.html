<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Monocytes and neutrophils are widely distributed throughout the body and play essential roles in health and disease. Here, we present a detailed protocol to isolate polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes from a single sample of human peripheral blood. We have optimized several aspects of the procedure, including the density gradient, timing of each cell processing step, and the buffer/media conditions to preserve cell viability for subsequent functional assays. This protocol is reproducible and can be scaled as required for downstream applications.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00551-7/sref15">Cui et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol describes the isolation of monocytes and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from human peripheral blood. The procedure is scalable as required by downstream applications. All reagents should be sterile. It is desirable to perform all steps in a tissue culture hood, particularly if purified cells are to be cultured. If this is not possible, we have found that a clean benchtop will also suffice.</p>
<p>Human studies used in this study were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Chicago (IRB160321).</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Equipment and reagent preparation</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 min</div>
<ol>
<li>Set the centrifuge to 18°C–22°C.</li>
<li>Make sure all reagents, including Ficoll-Paque PLUS, red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer, HBSS/EDTA, and PBS/EDTA, are at 18°C–22°C.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The efficiency of density gradient separation is greatly affected by temperature. Because this protocol relies on Ficoll-Paque PLUS to separate monocytes and PMNs, the centrifuge and reagents should be equilibrated to 18°C–22°C for optimal separation. Below this optimal temperature, the density of Ficoll-Paque PLUS increases, resulting in fewer RBCs and PMNs in the Ficoll-Paque PLUS layer and higher contamination in the mononuclear layer. Above this optimal temperature, the density of Ficoll-Paque PLUS decreases, resulting in contamination of mononuclear cells in the Ficoll-Paque PLUS layer.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Collection of human peripheral blood</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min</div>
<p>Blood collection from healthy donors and/or patients should be performed on the same day as the isolation by a trained phlebotomist under IRB approval. Exclusion criteria for donors should be considered for each specific study.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Collect human peripheral blood samples from donors.
<ol type="a">
<li>Draw blood into Vacutainer EDTA Tubes (purple cap tube).</li>
<li>Carefully invert tubes several times immediately upon collection. This step mixes blood with anticoagulant to prevent clot formation.</li>
<li>Store individual tubes of blood horizontally with gentle shaking on a rack at 18°C–22°C prior to processing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Vacutainer EDTA Tubes are available in variable volumes. The maximum volume of blood collected is lower than the indicated limit. For example, a 10 mL tube holds a maximum of ∼8 mL of blood. Variability in blood volume collected/tube does not compromise isolation.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Immediate isolation of fresh blood produces optimal results. Storage of blood prior to isolation is possible. If &gt;1 h delay between blood draw and separation, tubes should be kept on ice and warmed to 18°C–22°C before separation. Longer delays (24 h) may compromise PMN and monocyte viability.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Preparation of blood and Ficoll-Paque PLUS density gradient</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Prepare Leucosep<sup>TM</sup> tubes for density gradient centrifugation.
<ol type="a">
<li>Combine blood and measure total blood volume.</li>
<li>Calculate the number of Leucosep<sup>TM</sup> tubes required by dividing the total blood volume by 15 mL (e.g., 90 mL/15 mL = 6 tubes).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Leucosep<sup>TM</sup> contains a porous barrier, which allows for pre-diluted blood to be transferred without disturbing the underlying Ficoll-Paque PLUS layer. This provides an advantage over a regular Ficoll separation in a 50 mL conical tube.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The optimal blood volume per Leucosep<sup>TM</sup> tube is 15 mL. A lower limit of 10 mL/tube is required to ensure that the PBMC layer forms above the porous barrier post-centrifugation (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>A and <a href="#fig2">2</a>B). An upper limit of 18 mL/tube is required to ensure that blood is adequately diluted in HBSS/EDTA (see step 5 below). Accordingly, the number of Leucosep<sup>TM</sup> tubes required is flexible if the volume of blood/tube falls within a range of 10–18 mL/tube.</div>
</li>
<li>Add 15 mL of Ficoll-Paque PLUS per tube (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B).</li>
<li>Centrifuge at 1000×<i>g</i> for 30 s.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Ensure that Ficoll-Paque PLUS is completely below the porous barrier after centrifugation (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The density of Ficoll-Paque PLUS is 1.077 g/mL, which is optimal for isolating mononuclear cells from human blood. Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM, which has density 1.073 g/mL and ideal for isolating lower-density human mononuclear cells, can be used as alternative. Lymphoprep<sup>TM</sup>, which has density of 1.077 g/mL can also be used as direct substitute.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Dilute blood with HBSS/EDTA to a final volume of 30 mL per Leucosep<sup>TM</sup> tube. Blood: HBSS/EDTA ratio of 1:1 is recommended. However, other ratios are acceptable, according to the following limits:
<ol type="a">
<li>15 mL of blood (ideal) is mixed with 15 mL of HBSS/EDTA per tube.</li>
<li>10 mL of blood (lower limit) is mixed with 20 mL of HBSS/EDTA per tube.</li>
<li>18 mL of blood (upper limit) is mixed with 12 mL of HBSS/EDTA per tube.</li>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> A transfer pipette is desirable over pouring the layer out for two reasons. First, we have found that the dense PBMC layer can stick to the tube wall. A transfer pipette is better able to dislodge and recover all PBMCs. Second, if one intends to isolate neutrophils from the lower layer (see below), pouring may disrupt this lower layer and require additional centrifugation.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The PBMC layer from each Leucosep<sup>TM</sup> tube should not be combined. They should each be transferred into separate 50 mL conical tubes. For example, if you started with 45 mL of blood, you would have three Leucosep<sup>TM</sup> tubes and three PBMC layers, which should be transferred to three 50 mL conical tubes. If all PMBC layers are combined into one 50 mL conical tube, three washes will not effectively minimize platelet contamination (see steps 6–8).</div>

<h3 id="sec3.3">Isolation of human monocytes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> For steps 17–27: ∼1 h</div>
<p>This section illustrates positive selection of CD14+ monocytes by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) from Miltenyi Biotec. Another widely used method is EasySep human monocytes or CD14 positive selection kit from Stem Cell technology. Both methods have a comparable cost, time efficiency, and purity of isolation. But the equipment required (e.g., magnet, separator, etc.) is not interchangeable. Although we have not compared these two methods side by side, there could be functional differences of isolated monocytes for downstream activation. For example, one study showed that monocyte-derived dendritic cells showed better response to tumor antigens and hence better ability to induce T cell cytotoxicity against tumors when monocytes were prepared using MACS from Miltenyi Biotec compared to EasySep from Stem Cell technology (<a href="#bib8">Marques et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to positive selection, plastic adhesion and negative selection are two other methods used in the field. Plastic adhesion takes advantage of monocytes’ fast and strong adherence to tissue culture plates, while negative selection labels all other cell types except monocytes for magnetic selection. However, plastic adhesion results in lower yield and less than 50% purity. Negative selection can result in heavy contamination with platelets (<a href="#bib9">Nielsen et al., 2020</a>). This is consistent with our observations and hence we prefer positive selection and present a detailed protocol here. Admittedly, negative selection provides the advantage of avoiding the attachment of microbeads to monocytes, which might affects their function for downstream application (<a href="#bib3">Bhattacharjee et al., 2017</a>). And platelet removal cocktail in combination with negative selection (e.g., monocyte negative isolation kit, EasySep from Stem Cell) could circumvent the contamination issue. Nevertheless, we have not observed changes of expression level of CCR2 or CX3CR1, chemokine receptors that have been associated with activation, pre- and post-positive selection nor any hampered functionality of isolated monocytes.</p>

<p>A successful isolation from 50 mL of human blood should yield ∼8–15 million monocytes and ∼50–200 million PMNs. Both isolated cell types should have &gt;90% viability and &gt;90% purity. For monocytes, purity is assessed by quantifying CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>A). For PMNs, purity is assessed by quantifying CD16<sup>+</sup>CD10<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>B).

<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Additional cell markers can be used to further assess purity. For monocytes, contaminating cells may include T-cells, B-cells, low-density neutrophils (LDNs), and NK cells which are also present in the PBMC layer (<a href="#bib5">Kleiveland, 2015</a>).

<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol is most suitable for purifying PMNs and monocytes from freshly collected human blood. For other blood-derived starting materials (e.g., buffy coat, leukocyte reduction system chambers (LRSC)), optimization may be required. In addition, this protocol isolates high-density neutrophils (HDNs), which is the mature polymorphonuclear population present in the granulocyte layer. Low-density neutrophils (LDNs), which are phenotypically and functionally distinct from HDNs, reside in the PBMC layer (<a href="#bib10">Sagiv et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib13">Silvestre-Roig et al., 2019</a>). For isolation of LDNs, refer to the above references. Lastly, this protocol isolates CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which comprise both classical monocytes (∼90%, CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>−</sup>) and non-classical monocytes (∼10%, CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>). Isolation of specific monocyte populations requires additional methods (e.g., classical monocyte isolation kit; Mitenyi Biotec).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Low yield of monocytes (i.e., &lt;8 million cells from 50 mL of blood).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>One potential cause is that the temperature of Ficoll density gradient separation is suboptimal, refer to steps 1–2 in the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section. If the temperature of the centrifuge and/or reagents is above the optimal range (18°C–22°C), the density of Ficoll-Paque PLUS decreases, which results in monocyte loss from the PBMC layer. Ensure sufficient time for temperature equilibration of reagents and centrifuges. Another potential cause is insufficient dilution of blood with HBSS/EDTA (ideally 1:1), refer to step 5 in the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section. This results in high hematocrit, which may result in monocyte loss from the PBMC layer due to trapping by RBCs. Make sure that blood is diluted sufficiently. Another potential cause is suboptimal positive selection with CD14 MicroBeads. This could be due to several reasons. First, if the PBMC cell count is underestimated, the amount of CD14 MicroBeads added may be insufficient to bind all CD14<sup>+</sup> cells, refer to step 14 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section. Second, if MicroBeads were not thoroughly mixed prior to incubation, it may lower binding to CD14<sup>+</sup> cells, refer to step 19 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section. Third, if the binding of CD14 MicroBeads to cells occurs below 4°C (e.g., incubation on ice) then 15 min may be insufficient to bind all CD14<sup>+</sup> cells, refer to step 19 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section. Fourth, excessive numbers of clumped cells may bind non-specifically to CD14 MicroBeads and diminish yield, refer to step 23 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section. Clumped cells can be removed using a 40 μm filter.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Low yield of PMNs (i.e., &lt;50 million cells from 50 mL of blood).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>One potential cause is that the Ficoll-Paque PLUS density gradient separation is suboptimal. This could be due to several reasons. First, if the temperature of the centrifuge and/or reagents is below the optimal range (18°C–22°C), the density of Ficoll-Paque PLUS increases, which results in fewer RBCs and PMNs in the Ficoll-Paque PLUS layer, refer to steps 1–2 in the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section. Ensure sufficient time for temperature equilibration of reagents and centrifuges. Second, adequate time and <i>g</i>-force are required to ensure complete sedimentation of granulocytes and RBCs. We found that 800×<i>g</i> for 15min during density gradient centrifugation is optimal, refer to step 2 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section. Third, a vibration of the rotor or failure to turn the brake off can lead to disruption of the gradient, mixing of the cell layers, and loss of cells, refer to step 2 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section. Another potential cause is due to excessive RBC lysis, refer to steps 31–40 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section. Because there are many RBC lysis steps involved, an excessive amount of RBC lysis buffer may result in the lysis of PMNs (visualized as a ‘gooey’ pellet). Be cautious about the incubation time and volume of RBC lysis buffer used.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Low purity (i.e., &lt;90%) of monocytes.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>One reason could be due to excessive dead or clumped cells, which may bind non-specifically to CD14 MicroBeads, refer to step 23 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section. This affects not only monocyte yield, but also purity. We have found that the cell viability of PBMCs is typically high (&gt;95%); accordingly the presence of dead cells may reflect poor execution of previous steps in the protocol. Dead cell removal kits can be used, but often lead to substantial loss of live monocytes. Clumped cells can be avoided by resuspending PBMCs in small volumes first during the wash steps. They can also be effectively removed by passing cells through a 40 μm filter. Another reason is that binding to CD14 MicroBeads was performed for too long or at too high a temperature, both of which could lead to non-specific cell binding, refer to step 14 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section. Be cautious about temperature and time.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Low purity (i.e., &lt;90%) of PMNs.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are two potential sources of contamination in isolated PMNs. One is other granulocytes, which include basophils, eosinophils, and mast cells. Because the procedure to isolate PMNs described here relies on Ficoll-Paque PLUS density gradient centrifugation, the bottom cell layer contains all granulocytes. In healthy donors, PMNs account for ∼ 95% of total granulocytes populations. However, donors with allergic or inflammatory conditions may have higher levels of other granulocytes (i.e., &gt;5%) (<a href="#bib1">Alberts et al., 2014</a>). In this case, we have discarded the samples. While positive selection methods can be used to further purify PMNs, longer purification methods lead to reduced PMN viability (PMNs have a short half-life) and the functional status of PMNs could be influenced by the underlying condition of the donor. The second source of contamination is mononuclear cells. This can occur if the temperature of the centrifuge and reagents is below the optimal range (18°C–22°C) during Ficoll-Paque PLUS density gradient centrifugation, refer to steps 1–2 in the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section. Be cautious about temperature.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Low viability of isolated cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The timing of cell isolation is essential for maintaining cell viability. For optimal results, freshly collected blood should be processed immediately and the isolation should be performed efficiently, refer to step 3 in the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section. Substantial delays (&gt;4 h) in processing blood after collection can result in loss of cell viability. This is particularly problematic for PMNs because they have a very short half-life (∼7–24 h). In addition, the temperature, pH, and composition of buffers, as well as the timing of RBC lysis steps are essential. For example, buffers for PMN isolation should be at 18°C–22°C and void of magnesium or calcium, which can activate PMNs and induce apoptosis.</p>
