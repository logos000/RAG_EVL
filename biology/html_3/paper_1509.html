<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Evaluating auditory sensitivity is critical to hearing research, particularly to that focusing on hearing impairment. Auditory brainstem response recording is frequently used in mice to assess auditory sensitivity and is an approach superior to the traditional techniques. Here, we describe a protocol for recording ABR in mice using four-channel equipment. We detail the procedures of animal preparation, the setup of the ABR recording system, the click- and tone burst-evoked ABR recordings, and data analysis.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) method has over the years been widely used in clinical and research settings to assess auditory sensitivity. It is a method that is superior to the traditional techniques, such as observing the Preyer reflex. The Preyer reflex is a simple technique involving an administration of a sound stimulus, e.g., a loud hand clap, to an experimental animal, followed by observation of the reflective reaction (<a href="#bib5">Jero et al., 2001</a>). ABR recording is recognized as an easy-to-execute, low-cost and minimally invasive technology that reliably estimates the sensitivity of hearing. The characteristic waves of ABR are labeled with Roman numerals I-V, which originate from the cochlea and/or auditory nerve, the cochlear nuclei, and other brain structures. Here, we detail the procedure for assessing hearing threshold using a four-channel ABR system in mice. As an example, we collected data from mice with normal and impaired hearing. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparation of the experimental animals</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min</div>
<ol>
<li>Experimental animals. We use male C57 BL/6 mice in this study. The ages of the animals are specified in the figure legends. The animals are housed in a temperature-controlled room under a 12 h light/dark cycle. They have free access to rodent chow and tap water.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is not appropriate to perform ABR testing on mice that have signs of external ear canal or middle ear obstruction, or middle ear infection.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Anesthesia. Anesthetize the mouse 2–5 min prior to ABR recording via intraperitoneal injection of Avertin (tribromoethanol, 300 mg/kg).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Wear a laboratory coat, protective gloves and face mask when working with mice.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Genetic background, age and body weight (e.g., obesity) of the mice may have effects on the efficacy of anesthetics (<a href="#bib7">Naveilhan et al., 2001</a>; <a href="#bib10">Schuetze et al., 2019</a>). We used male C57 BL/6 mice in the following procedures. An extra dose of Avertin (1/3 of the original dose) will be needed if the procedures last for 45 min or longer.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> A combination of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) is also recommended. Narcotic drugs and dosage regimens can be referred to the institutional guidelines.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make sure the animals are deeply anesthetized (e.g., lack of response after a tail pinch or toe pinch). Maintain this level of anesthesia.</li>
<li>The animals should be placed in a soundproof chamber. Maintain the animal’s body temperature at 36.5°C–38.0°C with a heating pad.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Mice are prone to hypothermia due to the high ratio of body surface to body volume. When mice are deeply anesthetized, their metabolic rate will drop, which will impact the function of the inner ear and, ultimately leading to the elevation of the auditory threshold (<a href="#bib11">Shaw, 1986</a>; <a href="#bib12">Williston and Jewett, 1982</a>). Similarly, the mice should not be overheated.</div>

<li>The Giant multi-channel ABR system (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. Cat #GAT-ABR-003, Shenzhen Giant Technologies Company, Shenzhen, China) is used to assess 4 animals simultaneously. This device is powered by the rechargeable battery packs (see also <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a>).

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. A schematic for auditory brainstem response setup</div>
<p>Four mice are anesthetized, inserted with electrodes, and placed at a distance of 25 cm between their heads and the leading edge of the loudspeaker. The soundproof chamber is illustrated as dotted line. ABR stimuli, including clicks and tone bursts, are generated by speaker amplifier and the digital/analog (D/A) converter controlled by the Giant ABR software. ABR signals are amplified, bandpass filtered, and converted using an analog/digital (A/D) converter over 512 stimuli.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Make sure that the battery packs are fully charged, which usually takes ≥ 2 h, prior to use.</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Before mice are assessed, the system needs to be calibrated according to the manufacturer’s <a href="https://gianttek.cn/en/%e6%9c%aa%e5%88%86%e7%b1%bb-en/abr/">instructions</a>. In doing so, data obtained from different systems or laboratories can be compared (<a href="#bib1">Burkard, 2006</a>). Place the microphone (PCB 377C01) with preamplifier (PCB 426B03) 25 cm in front of the loudspeaker.
<ol type="a">
<li>Open the calibration interface of the Giant ABR software.</li>
<li>Select click or burst mode and load the corresponding configuration file. Click start to initiate calibration.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Place the loudspeaker 25 cm in front of the mouse head in a custom-made soundproof chamber (1.2 m L x 0.8 m W x 0.9 m H). The position of the loudspeaker should be oriented perpendicular to the mouse’s interaural axis.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Mark the position of the microphone used for calibration and place the mouse’s head in the marked position.</div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Scrub the ABR needle electrodes with 75% ethanol solution. Place the active electrode into the scalp subdermally at the vertex of the skull and between the ears (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A).

<p>(B and C) The positions to place reference electrode (B) and ground electrode (C) are indicated with white arrows.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>The reference electrode and the ground electrode should be placed subdermally underneath the ipsilateral ear (i.e., the ear of which the ABR is assessed) and at the hindlimb (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>B and 2C), respectively.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Place the ground electrode at the contralateral ear (<a href="#bib2">Chien et al., 2016</a>). In addition, the ground electrode can be inserted over the bregma, and the recording electrode is positioned lateral from the bregma just behind the pinna (<a href="#bib4">Jansen et al., 2013</a>). Alternatively, place the active electrode subcutaneously at the vertex, the reference electrode ventrolateral to the left ear, and the ground electrode above the tail (<a href="#bib3">Crispino et al., 2011</a>).</div>
<ol start="10">
<li>Examine the impedance before the recording of the auditory brainstem response. If the impedance is greater than 5 kΩ, adjust the needle electrode (e.g., the depth of insertion) so that it is placed at the proper position.</li>
<li>Set the program provided with the ABR system to record tone bursts (rate of sound presentation: 14/s) at 10–dB steps from 90 dB SPL (sound pressure level) to 10 dB SPL, which is below threshold for most mice with normal hearing ability.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The 10–dB down step was set based on existing empirical evidence (<a href="#bib4">Jansen et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib8">Papesh and Hurley, 2016</a>; <a href="#bib9">Pienkowski, 2018</a>), but can be adjusted as necessary. For example, if 10 dB is above the threshold for some of the mice, a lower intensity step can be added. Conversely, low-intensity steps may be omitted in mice with known hearing loss.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> No electronics using A.C. should be utilized in the soundproof chamber when recording ABR.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The ABR recordings should be analyzed offline. The Shenzhen Giant Technologies software (integrated with the ABR system, Shenzhen Giant Technologies) is used to process the original data and to generate the ABR waveforms. The following parameters are determined: amplitude of waves, latency, inter-peak latency, and threshold. Peak latencies are defined as the time elapsed from time zero to wave peaks. Individual wave amplitude is defined as the difference between the peak and the following trough. The ABR threshold is identified as the lowest waveform where any recognizable feature can be discerned (see also <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a>). The hearing ability of mice ranges from 0.5 to 120 kHz; however, they are more sensitive to the frequencies between 12 kHz and 24 kHz (<a href="#bib13">Zheng et al., 1999</a>). In <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A, click-evoked ABR is shown. The thresholds of 8 kHz tone bursts-elicited ABR are significantly elevated in mice under hypothermia (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>B and 3C). Hearing sensitivity declines progressively with aging. In literature, C57 BL/6 mice showed significant hearing impairment after 6 months of age (<a href="#bib6">Li and Borg, 1991</a>). In agreement with this observation, both the thresholds of click- and tone burst-evoked ABR are elevated in mice with hearing impairment as compared to the normal control (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a> and <a href="#fig5">5</a>).</p>

<p>We used SPSS statistics software (Ver. 17.0, IBM, Armonk, NY) for data analysis. To examine the effect of age on ABR thresholds, the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni’s <i>post hoc</i> test was utilized.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Whereas it is convenient to use ABR to assess hearing function in mice, this method also has some disadvantages. The rapid rise time of the acoustic stimulus that elicits this response can produce acoustic splatter, which can lead to a decrease in the frequency-specific response. Acoustic splatter usually occurs during the onset and/or offset of transmission, and refers to the spurious emissions owing to an abrupt change in the transmitted signal. Frequency specific ABR can be compromised due to acoustic splatter. Moreover, it is relatively difficult to achieve specific response at low frequency. Importantly, although subsequent changes in the acoustic stimulus waveform can provide important biological information, the ABR does not respond to these alterations. The action potentials associated with neural activity are comparatively small, therefore, ABR results can be affected by interference from feed-through from the speakers emitting acoustic stimuli and other electronic devices in the soundproof chamber. The ABR recording is an objective process, but interpretation of the results is subjective. Determination of ABR threshold relies, at least partially, on the investigator’s experience.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>It should be noted that the ABR is a field potential that is susceptible to electricity magnetic field, animal anesthesia, loudspeaker and hearing instrument working state.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The connection of the system (<a href="#sec1.2">Preparation of the recording equipment</a>, step 5).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Following the manufacturer’s instruction, start the Giant ABR program and listen to whether the speaker emits sound. Subsequently, select a channel to plug in the electrode, and touch the electrode with a finger. If the amplitude of this channel changes, it suggests that the connection is intact.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The ABR equipment does not work properly (<a href="#sec1.2">Preparation of the recording equipment</a>, step 5).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Maintain the instrument in good condition after each assay. Calibrate it regularly to ensure that it will be accurate.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Environmental interference (step 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The action potentials associated with neural activity in the auditory nervous system are small compared with signals from electronic equipment. Therefore, the ABR detection should be carried out in a well-shielded soundproof chamber, and should be far away from electrical noise. Avoiding use of high voltage noise sources, such as refrigerators, freezers or computer monitors, in the recording area. Using the battery packs to power the equipment when recording ABR. Try grounding equipment in the chamber or use aluminum foil for shielding.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Hypothermia (step 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Maintain the animal’s body temperature at 36.5°C–38.0°C. Hypothermia is a risk factor and has significant effects on the ABR recording. Use a heating pad (e.g., C2Dx TP 700 T/Pump System with temp therapy pad) that does not produce A.C. interference during the procedure.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Electrical interference during ABR recording (step 5).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Turn off electrical equipment in the soundproof chamber during the test. The equipment in the recording chamber can only be powered by the rechargeable battery. Besides, wires connected with the electrodes should be placed away from other wires of the equipment.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Insufficient anesthesia (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Avertin or a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) are recommended for the anesthesia of mice. If mice show signs of waking up, supplement 1/3 to 1/2 of the original dose of anesthetics and let the animals reach deep anesthesia.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Determination of threshold (<a href="#expected-outcomes">expected outcomes</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is advised that thresholds be determined by a second, experimentally blinded investigator. The data are then compared and differences are resolved.</p>
