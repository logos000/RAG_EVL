<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The blood-brain barrier acts as a major barrier for the entrance of most therapeutics into the brain, impeding treatment for neurological disorders. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of T cells is a useful tool for cell therapy of neurological disorders including neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases and brain tumors. Here, we present an optimized ICV injection of T cells with improved injection efficiency at pathological sites within the brain parenchyma. We describe details of the surgical procedure and verification of injection via immunohistochemistry.</p>

<p>Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of cells in mouse models is an efficient tool for exploring the therapeutic efficacy of cells injected directly into the central nervous system (CNS) and thus bypassing the blood-brain barrier. ICV injection has been implemented for the administration of stem cells for various neurological conditions (<a href="#bib10">Scruggs et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib11">Sironi et al., 2017</a>). Notably, a recent phase 1 study safely injected adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (ADSVF) into the human brain ventricular system of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. The authors reported a clinical improvement or stability of AD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients (<a href="#bib2">Duma et al., 2019</a>). We thus highlight the importance of this technique which presents an advantageous route of cell administration such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells targeted to brain malignances (<a href="#bib1">Bagley et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib6">Hunter and Jacobson, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib7">Majzner et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib9">Parker et al., 2020</a>), or brain antigen-specific T cells targeted to amyloid plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (<a href="#bib5">Fisher et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib12">Strominger et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib8">Mittal et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib3">Eremenko et al., 2019</a>). The protocol below describes the specific steps for injecting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells which were retrovirally transduced to express a green fluorescent protein (GFP). Although these cells were used to aid the better visualization of the injected cells, this protocol is compatible with all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which can be later stained with a suitable antibody to enable visualization.</p>
<p>Depending on your experimental needs, it is possible to inject unilaterally or bilaterally. For instance, unilateral ICV injections are suitable for cancer treatment studies (<a href="#bib7">Majzner et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib13">Tanaka et al., 2020</a>). As we were interested in the interaction between the injected cells and neural cells, we preferred a bilateral injection. Hence, our protocol focuses on bilateral ICV injections.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sterilize all the surgical tools.</li>
<li>Prepare mice for experiment (in this protocol we used 12 weeks C57BL/6JRccHsd male mice).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>To optimize the ICV injection by means of cell migration into the site of action, CD4<sup>+</sup> GFP T cells were ICV-injected to C57BL/6JRccHsd mice (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). Mice were sacrificed 72 h post injection and sagittal brain sections were obtained for immunohistochemistry analysis. Brain sections were imaged using a FLUOVIEW FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope.</p>
<p>To rule out any influence of the needle gauge size on cell viability, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were seeded (50,000 cells per well) in a 96 U-shape well plate. The cells were drawn into the syringe, holding either a 26 G or 30 G needle, twice. The live and dead cells were counted, using trypan blue to detect the non-viable cells, and the percent of live cells was calculated. The needle gauge size did not significantly affect cell viability (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B).</p>

<p>(B) Percent of live cells using the 26 G or the 30 G needle. CD4<sup>+</sup> GFP T cells were seeded in a 96 U-shape well plate (50,000 cells per well). Cells were drawn into the syringe, holding either a 26 G or 30 G needle, twice. Live and dead cells were counted and the percent of live cells was calculated. Error bars represent mean ± SEM.</p>
<p>(C) Distribution of the ICV-injected CD4<sup>+</sup> GFP T cells in hippocampal sections. C57BL/6JRccHsd mice were ICV-injected with 0.5 × 10ˆ6 CD4<sup>+</sup> GFP<sup>+</sup> T cells per hemisphere. After 72 h, the mice were sacrificed, the brains sectioned, and the sections counterstained with DAPI. GFP (green) and DAPI (blue) were visualized by confocal microscopy. Upper panels show results for 26 G needle and lower panels show results for 30 G needle. Scale bar 20 μm and 100 μm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Although the needle gauge size had no significant effect on cell viability, an increased frequency of injected cells was observed in the brain parenchyma using the 30 G, as compared with the 26 G size needle (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C). Thus, while optimizing the injection procedure, we have concluded that 1) the 30 G needle size increases the frequency of the injected cells at the site of action, and 2) the smallest drill head suitable for the needle gauge size should be used to minimize the backflow.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>One of the main limitations of ICV injection is the lengthy time per mouse, making it laborious and time consuming. Depending on the facility and personnel availability, we suggest to adjust the cohort size performed per day. It is also essential to ensure that the mice are not away from the animal facility for a prolonged duration. The mice should have free access to food and water.</p>
<p>The syringe should be thoroughly washed with 70% ethanol, PBS and then clean PBS between injections to avoid cross contamination of treatments. The double PBS washing reduces the tendency for salts sticking to the inside of the syringe. The proper washing procedure also reduces the risk of excess fluid being held in the syringe and injected to the next mouse. It is also important to note that the cells should only be drawn into the syringe once. If cells are repeatedly drawn into and released from the syringe, cell viability may be reduced.</p>
<p>We advise using isoflurane as the anesthesia as it provides effective short-term anesthesia effects. It is possible to use an alternative anesthesia, such as a ketamine/xylazine regimen, but this comes with a prolonged recovery time and an increased risk of hypothermia. If ketamine/xylazine is preferred, mice should be closely monitored until they regain consciousness and move around by themselves. It is also recommended to provide heat, such as a heating pad, during the recovery time. A rectal thermometer can be used to monitor the body temperature during the procedure and recovery time.</p>
<p>As it may be necessary to divide the cohort over several days and the injection time of each batch of cells may take a few hours, it is essential to check the viability and homogeneity of the cell samples throughout the experiment. This can be done via cell quality validation with flow cytometry analysis performed on the day of injection.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Failure to correctly mount mouse onto stereotactic apparatus (steps 1 and 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure the mouse is fully anesthetized before transferring it to the stereotactic apparatus.</p>
<p>Confirm sufficient anesthesia by assessing the foot-pinch response.</p>
<p>Set position of left ear bar at start of all the injections and only adjust the right ear bar to secure head in position.</p>
<p>Ensure the mouse’s nose is securely in the anesthesia adaptor to ensure the mouse remains anesthetized throughout the procedure.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Failed injection due to incorrect injection site (step 6, 7 and 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Confirm you can clearly visualize the bregma and lambda.</p>
<p>Ensure the mouse head is mounted straight by utilizing the bregma and lambda as reference points.</p>
<p>Ensure the head is stable by gently pressing on the top of the head, once mounted. This ensures the head does not move during the drilling and injection steps.</p>
<p>Ensure the drill is inserted into the holder correctly.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Backflow of the injected cell suspension (steps 8 and 12–14).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use the smallest drill head size suitable for the needle.</p>
<p>Inject at a flow rate of 1 μL/min.</p>
<p>Once the injection is finished, wait 2 min before slowly raising the needle to −1.15 mm in the dorsoventral axis. Then wait a further minute before slowly raising the needle out of the hole.</p>
<p>Insert and raise the needle slowly to help decrease the backflow rate.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Bleeding due to incorrect drilling of the skull (steps 6 and 8)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure the drill is inserted correctly into the holder. Otherwise, the drill can move during drilling resulting in the hole being drilled in the wrong area or damage to the brain.</p>
<p>It is important not to drill too deep to prevent puncturing the skull resulting in bleeding and inflammation of the brain.</p>
<p>If bleeding does occur due to drilling, use a gauze to apply pressure to the injection site until the bleeding has stopped.</p>
<p>If brain is badly damaged, exclude the mouse from the experiment.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Death of mouse (steps 1, 4, and 18).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure to use the correct isoflurane concentration, we use 2%.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use alternative anesthesia, for example, ketamine xylazine, but recovery time is longer and comes with a higher risk of hypothermia.</p>
<p>Place mouse on heat pad during procedure to prevent hypothermia.</p>
<p>Monitor mice post procedure until they wake up and are moving on their own.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Decreased viability of cells if left on ice too long (step 9).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If many mice need to be injected, prepare the cells in different batches throughout the day to prevent them being on ice for too long.</p>
<p>Depending on your experimental needs, it may be an option to decrease the injection time per mouse by injecting unilaterally.</p>
<p>Prepare aliquots of cells in culture media, only wash and suspend in PBS directly prior to injection.</p>
<p>Ensure to sufficiently clean the syringe with ethanol 70% and PBS between injections.</p>
