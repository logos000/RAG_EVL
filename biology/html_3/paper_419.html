<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Effective therapeutics for malignant primary brain tumors, such as glioblastomas (GBMs), are urgently needed. To facilitate and expedite early-phase GBM therapeutic development, we describe a protocol that allows the intranasal delivery of experimental compounds in GBM orthotopic mouse models. Compounds delivered through this route can bypass the blood-brain barrier and thus help validate effective therapeutic targets for GBMs.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib10">Pinkham et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Generation of luciferase expressing GBM cells</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5 days</div>
<p>Luciferase reporters are commonly used for monitoring tumor growth in small animals and for estimating tumor burden following intracranial implantation of GBM cells in mice. To stably express Firefly luciferase (Fluc) in primary GBM cells, we use a lentivirus vector containing Fluc and a fluorescent protein such as mCherry, separated by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element and cloned into a lentivirus vector under the control of the strong constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter to produce a LV-Fluc-mCherry. We have successfully used such lentivirus system to stably express, and simultaneously detect bioluminescence and fluorescence in several patient-derived GBM cells.</p>
<p>Transduction of GBM cells with LV-Fluc-mCherry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plate one million cells in one well of a 6-well plate.</li>
<li>After 24 h, add LV-Fluc-mCherry lentivirus vector at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10–50 in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene.</li>
<li>After 16–24 h, spin down the cells at 1,500 × <i>g</i> for 5 min and wash with PBS and add fresh culture medium then incubate the cells for at least 48 h prior to testing Fluc expression and/or detecting mCherry fluorescence.</li>
<li>Determine the transduction efficiency by analysis of the mCherry expression using fluorescence microscopy.</li>
<li>For detection of Fluc expression, its substrate D-luciferin (450 μM) is added either directly to the cells, in a 96 well optical plate. Alternatively (for more sensitive detection) the substrate could be added to the cell lysate. The signal is measured for 10 s to acquire photon counts and integrated over 2 s using a luminometer.</li>
<li>Following a successful transduction of GBM cells with LV-Fluc-mCherry, both Fluc and mCherry genes will integrate within the genome and therefore the cells will stably express the reporter. At this point the cells can be expanded and either directly used for intracranial implantation or cryopreserved for later use.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Lentiviruses are considered a biological hazard and therefore all experiments using such system should be performed in biosafety level 2 certified laboratories.</div>
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause Point:</span> Fluc-expressing cells can be frozen and stored for future use prior to the next step.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparing GBM cells for implantation in mice</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–4 weeks</div>
<p>Typically, patient-derived primary GBM cells are thawed and expanded 1–4 weeks prior to the planned in vivo experiment. We usually thaw one vial of frozen cells containing 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells which will be cultured in a 60 mm cell culture dish. It is best to prevent long-term expansion of primary GBM cells. Therefore, it is possible to thaw multiple frozen vials for experiments with a large animal cohort that require high number of cells. Short-term cell culture will minimize genetic and metabolic adaptability of tumor cells to an artificial environment (rich in glucose and O<sub>2</sub>, controlled pH, etc.). This is also important in order to decrease the risk of mycoplasma contamination (cells to be implanted are confirmed to be mycoplasma negative few days prior to tumor implantation).</p>
<p>Primary GBM cells maintained under serum-free conditions typically grow as neurospheres (spheroids). These cells are cultured in DMEM/F12 or in Neurobasal medium (NBM), which is commonly used as a culture medium in the field (<a href="#bib6">Lee et al., 2006</a>). For our protocol, DMEM/F12 is supplemented with: B27 supplement (without vitamin A; final concentration 1×), recombinant human EGF (final concentration 20 ng/mL), recombinant human FGF2 (final concentration 10 ng/mL) and heparin (final concentration 2 μg/mL). Cells are passaged once a week and cell culture medium is changed once a week, in addition fresh cell culture medium is added three times a week.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Trypan blue (1:1) can be used to facilitate counting and verify viability and health of the cultured cells. Make sure to correct for dilution when calculating the number of cells.</div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Confirm stable luciferase expression

<li>Confirm that cells express Fluc by measuring Fluc activity. As previously outlined, we typically use a lentivirus system to stably co-express Fluc and a fluorescent reporter.

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The health of GBM cells is critical for seeding after intracranial implantation and for tumor growth. If you do not have enough cells, the cells do not look healthy, or the luciferase is not stably expressed, consider postponing the experiment. In case the cells test positive for mycoplasma, you should consider thawing a new batch of cells whenever possible or, alternatively, treat the cells for mycoplasma removal (abm Mycoplasma Elimination Cocktail, 0.05 μL/mL of cell culture medium) for several days prior to their injection in mice. In case the cells have an altered morphology, are growing slower than usual, or are unable to form tight spheres, you should discard them and thaw a new vial. If Fluc expression is low, or in case not all GBM cells were stably transduced with the lentivirus expressing Fluc, consider re-infecting the cells or sorting them based on high expression of the fluorescence reporter (which is co-expressed with Fluc).</div>
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause Point:</span> Cells can be frozen and stored. However, the prior step will have to be repeated before the protocol can be continued.</div>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 20 min</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Count cells to ensure that the desired cell count (1.5 times the number of mice to be implanted multiplied with the amount of cells to implant per mouse, e.g., for 40 mice and 50,000 cells/mouse requires 1.5 × 40 × 50,000 cells) is obtained before continuing with the IC injections the next day.

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Split cells into two or more cell culture dishes depending on how many aliquots of cells you will need the next day. This will minimize handling of cultured cells in a given plate and therefore the risk of contamination while collecting aliquots of cells for implantation the next day.</li>
</ol>
<p>We typically plate enough cells to implant 12–15 mice during a time period of 3 h. After 3 h, the remaining cells are discarded, and a new batch of cells is collected for subsequent surgeries (as detailed below).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The size of the plate should be selected according to the number of cells to be plated. Neurospheres generally will grow better when plated at a higher density. Keep in mind the individual needs and growth rate of any particular cell line. Cell culture dishes with an Ultra-Low Attachment Surface could also be used to prevent cells for adhering and growing as a monolayer.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.5">Weighing and assessment of the mice</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 20 min</div>
<ol start="11">
<li>Before starting, it is important to weigh and check the mice. For our experiments, we use male or female athymic nude mice (age 5–7 weeks, average weight 20 g). Possible differences in weight should be accounted for between treatment groups. Also, a deviation from the expected weight may require adjustments in dosing of anesthesia, analgesics, luciferase reagent, and therapeutics.</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 20 min per cage, overlap possible</div>
<p>This step of the protocol enables the monitoring of tumor initiation and growth. The speed at which the cells engraft and grow in the mouse model varies considerably between different cell lines. Detectable tumors can develop within days or can take up to several weeks.</p>
<p>Tumor growth can be monitored by imaging Fluc bioluminescence activity using a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera such as the Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging System (PerkinElmer), after intraperitoneal injections of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg body weight). The Fluc signal, which is, in this case, a surrogate marker for tumor volume is quantitated using the Living Image software 4.3.1 (PerkinElmer).</p>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min</div>
<p>In this step, to overcome obstacles by various barriers of the CNS blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood–cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers, the molecule of choice is delivered via nose-to-brain route by intranasal (IN) administration. The IN route of administration provides a non-invasive method for delivering therapeutics directly to the CNS. Several therapeutic compounds or biological agents such as peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, nanoparticles, viral vectors, and stem cells can be delivered via the IN route (<a href="#bib3">Dhuria et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib9">Oberoi et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib2">Bruinsmann et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p>This alternative drug delivery method has also other advantages over systemic administration such as an increased targeting to the brain and a reduced systemic toxicity.</p>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Do not allow the pipette tip to touch the nostrils (<a href="#bib3">Dhuria et al., 2010</a>). Mouse are obligatory nose breathers (<a href="#bib5">Kling, 2011</a>; <a href="#bib4">Grimaud and Murthy, 2018</a>); inserting the pipette to administer the medication can cause unnecessary animal distress. <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>: Difficulty breathing or liquid leaking out of the nose immediately after injection</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Timing can be critical for the IN delivery. When a relatively high volume of liquid is injected too quickly, the result may be a difficulty in breathing (<a href="#bib3">Dhuria et al., 2010</a>) (which might cause the mice to wake up earlier; <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>: Mouse waking up during IN injection) or liquid leaking out of the nose immediately after injection. You should allow sufficient time for the mouse to sniff one drop at a time, before administering the next (<a href="#bib3">Dhuria et al., 2010</a>). On the other hand, if IN delivery is performed over an extended period of time, the anesthesia will wear off, and the mouse will wake up. Therefore, make sure the animal is deeply anesthetized prior to starting the IN administration of the drug. The aforementioned timeframe should serve as a reference point and can be adjusted according to individual experimental requirements. The maximum absorbance capacity of a mouse’s nasal cavity is 0.032 cm<sup>3</sup> (<a href="#bib3">Dhuria et al., 2010</a>); working in a range of 10–30 μL volumes decreases the chances of lethal nostril occlusion.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Depending on the cell line used, tumors are usually established within days or weeks after implantation. It has been shown that drugs administered through the IN route can reach the brain within minutes (<a href="#bib11">Ross et al., 2008</a>), but the onset of measurable effects can vary depending on the administered compound, its pharmacological properties, and the dose applied. Based on our published results (<a href="#bib10">Pinkham et al., 2019</a>), the delivery of experimental GBM therapeutics via the IN route can be highly effective. Under our experimental conditions, we were able to demonstrate that a small molecule inhibitor of Stearoyl CoA Desaturase (CAY10566, 5 mg/kg) delivered through nasal instillation in GBM xenograft mouse models, effectively decreased tumor burden. This was assessed with Fluc imaging of brain tumors and Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of brain sections (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Moreover, we also observed a significantly extended overall survival (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Whenever a small number of tumor cells are implanted (e.g., when implanting a very aggressive and fast-growing GBM line) or when the injected tumor cells are poorly tumorigenic, a higher variation in tumor engraftment and/or tumor growth can be observed. This can be a confounding factor for treatment outcomes. Whenever possible, an attempt should be made to distribute the animals evenly among the groups based on the measured bioluminescence signal.</p>
<p>The implantation of the tumor cells should be standardized by injecting them through an automated pump in order to minimize inter-examiner variability. However, IN administration has a higher variability, since it cannot be standardized. It is advised that IN administration would be handled by the same examiner throughout the treatment process.</p>
<p>The delivery of experimental therapeutics to the brain via the IN route has several advantages as discussed earlier. While it could be very effective in determining whether an experimental compound can engage and target brain tumors in a mouse, it does not address potential systemic toxicity, nor does it provide information about the pharmacokinetic properties of a given compound, particularly its ability to cross the brain barriers. Further, it is unclear whether IN delivery provides a wide distribution of the injected compound throughout the brain. Therefore, this delivery method might not be optimal for all types of experimental glioma models (for example brain stem gliomas) and should be evaluated on case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Clogging of the needle during intracranial injection (step 12e).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Rinse the needle several times with PBS and ethanol (95%–100%). If this does not help, remove the plunger and rinse the inside of the syringe by pushing ethanol into it with another syringe.</p>
<p>If the injection has already begun, we recommend excluding the mouse from the analysis, since it is no longer possible to reliably inject the exact number of cells, and accordingly, this would interfere with bioluminescence imaging quantification and survival outcome. To prevent clogging of the needle, rinse the needle after each injection, immediately after the injection has stopped and the needle has been retrieved. Clogging risk increases when injecting neurospheres that were not fully dissociated into a single-cell suspension.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>No bioluminescence signal detected from tumors (step 18).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If no bioluminescence signal can be detected in the brain after imaging the mice, check whether the substrate (D-luciferin) is properly reconstituted and has been properly stored. If necessary, the injection should be repeated with a new aliquot.</p>
<p>In addition, whenever the appropriate equipment is available, it is possible to alternatively image fluorescence signal from the tumor (since cells express both Fluc and a fluorescent reporter). Of note, several in vivo imaging platforms such as Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging System combine the ability to image bioluminescence and fluorescence.</p>
<p>If the signal is still undetected after the previous troubleshooting steps, imaging should be repeated on weekly basis to allow tumors to reach a detectable size.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Extracranial tumor growth (step 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Extracranial tumor growth can occur when cell suspension (fluid containing cells) is transferred to places outside the planned injection site in the brain. Wiping the needle with a sterile cotton tip before injection and wiping the injection site after injection can help remove any remaining cells outside the injection site, ensuring that no cells would seed outside the brain and form extracranial tumors. Extracranial tumor growth can also be caused by injecting a very large volume of cell suspension, or by withdrawing the syringe too quickly after tumor cell injection. This may cause the cell suspension to be pushed back out of the implanted area. Extracranial tumor growth may become apparent at any time after implantation of the tumor cells. Practically, this may be noticed, for example, by an abnormally high bioluminescence signal or a visible lump on the head of the animal.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Poor drug delivery to the brain (step 20).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Poor drug delivery to the brain after IN administration can be caused by the protective barriers located in the nasal mucosa. To overcome issues related to poor drug delivery, some changes in drug formulation could be tested. For instance, drugs can be encapsulated into carriers other than cyclodextrin, such as microemulsions and nanoparticles to increase drug solubility and dispersion along the nose-to-brain route. Agents with mucoadhesive properties such as surface-engineered nanoparticles, efflux transporter inhibitors, and vasoconstrictors to reduce drug clearance by the mucociliary nasal cells, could increase the absorption time of the drug at the delivery site. This can potentially enhance the deliver into the CNS via olfactory and trigeminal nerves, systemic blood, or cerebrospinal fluid and lymphatic channels.</p>
<p>Head positioning is one of the major factors that influences the efficiency of drug delivery to the brain during IN administration. The correct grip handle with a dominant hand keeping the down-and forward head position, requires trained personnel to achieve the best dispersion and penetrance of the therapeutic for an efficient brain delivery and to avoid drug drainage into the airways, or to the esophagus.</p>
<p>Poor drug delivery to the brain may be evident by the fact that there is no measurable effect of the drug treatment which can be determined by bioluminescence imaging.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Difficulty breathing or liquid leaking out of the nose immediately after injection (step 20).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is usually caused by either an excessive volume of liquid being injected into the nose, or by a rapid injection which does not allow enough time for inhalation and absorption of the injected liquid. Consider minimizing the injected volumes and/or injecting the solution at a slower rate. Also, make sure that the compound to be injected is fully soluble. Large particles or precipitates due to a poorly soluble compound can clog the nostrils or cause a major irritation.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Mouse waking up during IN injection (step 20).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To achieve a successful IN delivery, it is critical that the mouse is inert thus allowing the solution to be precisely administered into the nostril. Make sure the animal is deeply anesthetized prior to starting the IN administration of the drug. One reason for mice waking up during the procedure, can also be a difficulty in breathing. In this case, make sure one drop is sniffed in completely before administering the next.</p>
