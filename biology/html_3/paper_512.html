<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Co-fractionation/mass spectrometry (CF/MS) is a flexible and powerful method to detect physical associations of proteins. CF/MS can be applied to any tissue or organism without the need for protein-specific antibodies or epitope tags. Here, we outline two alternate protocols for MS preparation of samples (containing low or high salt) and a computational pipeline (cfmsflow) that together allow the successful application of this approach. These protocols are based on CF/MS of over 16 diverse organisms including plants and animals.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib5">McWhite et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<li>Prepare a native protein extract from your sample using any method optimized for the chosen starting material that avoids using organic solvents or other denaturing compounds. Low concentrations of non-ionic detergents (e.g., up to 1% NP40 or equivalent) can aid cell lysis, however higher concentrations of detergents can dissociate protein-protein interactions and interfere with the subsequent electrospray-based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis. Detergents used for the initial extraction are typically omitted from subsequent chromatographic separation buffers in order to reduce any potential impact on mass spectrometry.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> if you include detergent and must use ultrafiltration to concentrate your lysate prior to fractionation, be mindful that micelles may also be concentrated and increase detergent concentration with consequent disruption of protein assemblies.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Fractionate 1–4 mg of total native protein extract into 12–100 protein fractions using any convenient method such as size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, isoelectric focusing, glycerol gradient separation, etc.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The following MS preparation protocols assume you have collected your fractions in a 96-well format. There are two distinct MS preparation methods provided. If your samples contain &gt;300 mM salt, then use Method 1. If your samples will be &lt;300 mM salt, then use Method 2. Methods are compared in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.</div>

<p>Four support ribs on the underside of the deep well plate (indicated by black arrows in lower left) interfere with prongs on the blue magnetic plate preventing close contact of the well bottoms with the magnet. The 4 ribs are cut and folded as follows to accommodate the prongs. For each of the 4 interfering support ribs use a straight-edge razor to make 2 vertical cuts of the approximate depth shown. Use metal forceps or other tool to bend the resultant plastic tabs over. After modification of the 4 ribs the deepwell plate should sit flush on the magnetic plate as shown in the upper right panel.</p>

<li>Before beginning to prepare your fractions for LC/MS analysis, prepare the required solutions from the <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> below using LC/MS-grade water and reagents as much as possible. If you are not using a commercially-prepared solution of TCEP, prepare a 0.5 M stock in water (this may require pH adjustment with potassium hydroxide for full solubility). If you will be using Method 2 additionally prepare and aliquot SpeedBeads (as described below).

<p>The two alternate experimental methods below each begin with separated protein fractions in a deepwell 96-well plate and are described briefly in <a href="#bib5">McWhite et al., 2020</a>. See the <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a> for necessary specialty plates and equipment described in the protocols. Both methods require a 96-well plate-compatible vacuum manifold and a vacuum centrifuge (e.g., Eppendorf Vacufuge; #022820044) with a microplate adaptor. Method 2 additionally requires a magnetic slab (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific 96-well magnetic plate separator; A14179) and may require modification of the 96-well plate as in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> to allow the plate to adequately contact the magnet. Multichannel pipettes are helpful throughout. Solutions to make up in advance are listed in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> with recipes below. Unless otherwise specified all solutions are made in LC/MS-grade water.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Prepare protein fractions for MS analysis</h3>
<h4 id="sec3.1.1">Method 1: Ultrafiltration and in-solution digest</h4>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 days</div>
<p>We use two different methods for reduction/alkylation and trypsin digestion of samples in 96-well plates for MS analysis (outlined in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). If your sample contains &gt;300 mM salt, then use Method 1 directly below. If your sample contains &lt;300 mM salt, then use Method 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Buffer exchange and sample concentration.
<ol type="a">
<li>Use a vacuum manifold and vacuum of up to −24 Hg for all plate conditioning and sample concentration steps. Wash any preservatives or wetting agents from a 3k MWCO AcroPrep Advance 96 filter plate (see <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a>) by adding a 300-μL volume of LC/MS-grade H<sub>2</sub>O and pulling it through the membrane using vacuum. Then condition the filter plate by adding a 300-μL volume of Trypsin Digestion Buffer and pulling the solution through the membrane using vacuum.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If all 96 wells are not required place a sealing film over unused wells. The plate can be saved after use, and the unused wells uncovered for use at a later date.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Throughout all washes and subsequent steps do not let the wells dry out or proteins may stick irreversibly to the membrane.</div>
</li>
<li>Stop the vacuum and shake excess liquid from the washed plate.</li>
<li>Transfer your samples to the washed AcroPrep plate. Apply vacuum to the 96-well filter plate to reduce the sample volume to ~100 μL.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Samples will flow through the filter-plate wells at variable rates due to varied macromolecular content. Monitor the liquid volumes throughout filtration and add Trypsin Digestion Buffer to samples as necessary to prevent rapidly flowing wells from drying before all wells are adequately concentrated.</div>
</li>
<li>Add a 100-μL volume of Trypsin Digestion Buffer to all wells, and mix using several aspirate and dispense cycles of a pipette.</li>
<li>Continue vacuum filtration to reduce the sample volume to ~ 50 μL.</li>
<li>Transfer concentrated samples back into the original deep well plate for digestion.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Reduction/Alkylation
<ol type="a">
<li>To the 50-μL volume of sample, add a 50-μL volume of 100% TFE.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Even if your sample volume is &gt;50-μL do NOT add more than a 50-μL volume of 100% TFE, or the final concentration at the digestion step could inhibit trypsin activity.</div>
</li>
<li>Add a sufficient volume of the 0.5 M TCEP stock for a final concentration of 5 mM in each sample well, seal the plate with clear film, and incubate for 30 min at 37°C.</li>
<li>Place the plate at room temperature (20°C–25°C) and add a sufficient volume of the 550 mM iodoacetamide stock for a final concentration of 15 mM in each sample well.</li>
<li>Seal the plate and incubate for 30 min in the dark, and at room temperature (20°C–25°C).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Iodoacetamide is light sensitive and reactive in aqueous solution. We generally store small aliquots of the 550 mM stock solution of iodoacetamide in water at −20°C. These are thawed directly prior to use in this protocol. Alternatively, a fresh stock can be made from powder directly before use.</div>
</li>
<li>Quench the unreacted iodoacetamide by the addition of a sufficient volume of the 1 M DTT stock for a final concentration of 7.5 mM in each sample well.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Digestion
<ol type="a">
<li>Add ~880-μL volume of the Trypsin Digestion Buffer to bring each sample to a final volume of 1 mL, this dilution reduces the TFE concentration to less than 5%.</li>
<li>Add a 10 μL volume (1 μg of enzyme) of a proteomics-grade Trypsin stock solution in 10 mM acetic acid to each well.</li>
<li>Seal the plate with clear film and digest overnight (12–16 h) at 37°C.</li>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Strong vacuum can lead to bubbling/foaming of the eluting liquid causing cross-contamination of samples so pay attention at this step and adjust the vacuum accordingly.

</li>
<li>Elute the digested peptides into the collection plate using a 50-μL volume of 60% Buffer B per well. Repeat the elution step a second time for a total eluate volume of 100 μL.</li>

<h3 id="sec3.3">LC/MS system and acquisition conditions</h3>
<p>To maximize its generality, this protocol was explicitly designed to work with CF/MS data collected using different LC/MS equipment and analysis protocols, including both label and label-free protein quantification. In practice, we frequently use the following LC/MS setup:</p>
<p>Peptides are separated using reverse phase chromatography on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano UHPLC system with a C18 trap to Acclaim C18 PepMap RSLC column configuration. We typically employ a data-dependent acquisition strategy on either a Thermo Orbitrap Elite, Orbitrap Fusion, or Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. If using an Orbitrap Fusion or Lumos, we elute peptides with a 3%–45% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid over 60 min, and if using a less sensitive machine (Orbitrap Elite) we employ a longer gradient separation, e.g., 5%–40% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid over 120 min. Additional details are provided in <a href="#bib5">McWhite et al., 2020</a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Plates prepared as above are ready for protein detection and quantification by LC/MS. We typically exclude fractions corresponding to baseline UV signal in a chromatographic separation. In cases where a particular separation experiment is repeated we will also exclude those particular fractions that previously contained insufficient material to confidently identify proteins.</p>
<p>In our experience, starting with samples that contain too little protein is the biggest cause of failure. Fractionation experiments beginning with less than 1 mg total protein generally produce poor results. We recommend aiming for 1–4 mg total protein at a concentration of ≥ 5 mg/mL. Failure to reach this amount can occur when beginning with too little starting material. If grinding the material on liquid nitrogen and prior to protein extraction, aim for at least a 1 mL volume of frozen powder, ideally 5 mL. Likewise, failure to extract sufficient protein can occur when the sample inherently has a very low proportion of protein per overall mass (e.g., starch-filled seeds) or a high amount of confounding non-proteinaceous substances (e.g., abundant mucus). In these cases it is important to use extraction methods specialized for the particular organism or tissue.</p>
<h3 id="sec4.1">Quality control</h3>
<p>After fractionation, proteins in each fraction are identified and quantified by LC/MS. This information is used to create elution profiles across all fractions for each protein observed. After proteins have been identified, we typically spot-check the elution profile in Excel for intact protein complexes, typically highly stable and abundant protein complexes such as the proteasome, CCT chaperonin, and ribosome. <a href="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/512-Mmc1.xlsx">Table S1</a> shows an example of one of these elution profiles, annotated with protein names and a selection of the typically highly stable and abundant complexes we use as internal controls. In practical terms, if a fractionation experiment shows, e.g., core proteasome subunits with different elution patterns, it means that the experimental preparation may have failed to preserve intact protein complexes. To simplify this quality control step, we add a sparkline column showing the elution profile of each protein, and an annotation column containing, e.g., gene names or protein names. As a quick-and-dirty sanity check, proteins that are members of the same complex are often named similarly (i.e., CCT1, CCT2, CCT3), etc, so sorting the Excel sheet by the annotation column will group members of some complexes together, allowing their intactness to be quickly visually assessed by the similarity of subunit sparklines.</p>
<h3 id="sec4.2">Determine protein interactions from protein elution profiles</h3>
<p>The computational protocol identifies sets of proteins which have related elution profiles, signifying that these sets are physically associating. For determining protein interactions, we always use a set of separations represented by at least two different fractionation techniques (e.g., size exclusion and ion exchange). Many complexes elute in the same size range, or the same charge range, however few elute at both the same size and charge. The orthogonality of separations of different biochemical properties highly increases the discovery power of CF/MS.</p>
<p>To simplify the computational process of detecting protein interactions from CF/MS data, we provide cfmsflow, a Nextflow pipeline for Linux systems. This pipeline takes as inputs identified protein profiles (elution profiles) and uses known protein interactions (provided by the user) to train a model of elution profile similarity.</p>
<p>The pipeline is divided into 5 main steps (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). To summarize, these steps are to 1) Calculate similarities between protein elution profiles, 2) Combine similarity scores into a feature matrix, 3) Label the feature matrix with gold standard protein-protein interactions, 4) Train a model to detect and score pairwise protein interactions, 5) Cluster the resulting protein interaction network into complexes.</p>
<figure id="fig3"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/512-Fig3.jpg" alt="Fig3.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 3. Overview of computational pipeline to detect protein-protein interactions and protein complexes</div>
<p>In step 1, a set of similarity scores between all proteins are calculated for each fractionation experiment. In step 2, these similarity scores are combined into one large table. In step 3, pairs of proteins that are known from prior literature to interact are labeled with a 1 (positive training label), and a set of random pairs of proteins are labeled with a −1 (negative training label). In step 4, a model is trained to distinguish these positive and negatively labeled pairs of proteins, giving a score to each pair, where a higher score indicates higher probability of interaction. In step 5, this interaction network is clustered to protein complexes.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By default, the pipeline begins at step 1 (calculating protein profile similarities) and continues through step 5 (detect complexes), however, a subset of steps or individual steps may be run as set in the user parameter file.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ~24 h for a dataset containing 8,000 proteins; varies by computational resources</div>
<p>The pipeline requires two main data inputs 1) A set of known gold standard protein complexes, and 2) One table of protein identifications for each fraction per each separation experiment. Examples of all input files can be found in the example_input/ directory. For maximal power in deriving protein-protein interactions, it is ideal to use multiple separations using different separation techniques, as CF/MS gains substantial statistical power from reproducible co-elution behavior of interacting proteins across otherwise distinct separations. Each table of protein identifications for each fractionation plate should be formatted as a comma separated table with header, where the first column (named ID) contains protein identifiers, and the following columns contain protein quantification in each fraction. Values can be any abundance metric, such as peptide spectral matches (PSMs), peptide peak area or precursor ion intensity. We typically use gold standard protein complexes from the CORUM database. This file should be formatted with one protein complex per line, and each protein in the complex separated by a space.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>No single extraction method will be able to comprehensively identify all protein complexes because of their diverse biochemical characteristics. For example, extraction conditions that readily solubilize cytoplasmic proteins may not be optimal for transmembrane proteins or cytoskeletal proteins. Therefore the original extraction conditions and chromatography method will most directly affect the range of detectable proteins identified by LC/MS. Failure to identify a specific expected protein complex is typically attributable to insufficient abundance of complex members or insufficient stability of the complex. If a protein is detected with less than approximately 10 PSMs per fractionation experiment, it is unlikely that this experimental approach will be able to confidently detect its interactors.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Pipeline fails to run</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, confirm that the example parameter json (<code>example_params/example_wholepipeline.json</code>) runs to completion. If it does not, use provided example parameter jsons to test and troubleshoot individual steps of the pipeline. Next, confirm that the file format of your input files exactly matches the corresponding example input files, including delimiters and column names when specified. Confirm at the command line that file paths in your parameter json exist. If missing parameters are warned, add those parameters to your parameter json.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Overfit model</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When a model is overfit to the training data, it fails to generalize to data not used to train the model. Overfitting can be visually diagnosed by comparison of the precision-recall curves of training and test of interactions (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). While models will generally perform better on training labels, a large gap in performance between training and test precision-recall curves is diagnostic of an overfit model. Overfitting can often be reduced by reducing the number of features that are used to construct the model. The initial run of the pipeline will produce a <code>.featureimportances</code> file after step 4, which contains feature importances determined by Random Feature Elimination. To rerun the TPOT pipeline limiting the maximum number of features, modify the <code>max_features_to_select</code> value in your user parameters json to a smaller number than the total number of features and resume the pipeline with <code>nextflow main.nf –params-file user_parameters.json –resume</code> or create a new parameters file that begins at step 4<code>.</code></p>
<figure id="fig4"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/512-Fig4.jpg" alt="Fig4.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 4. Using precision-recall curves to evaluate overfitting</div>
<p>Precision-recall curves illustrating overfit, better fit, and underfit models. A substantial difference between Test and Train precision-recall curves suggests overfitting, and that the max number of features should likely be lowered to improve model performance. When a model is overfit, as features are removed, the Test precision-recall curve will shift right, while the training curve is minimally affected. Once too many features have been removed, performance in both test and training will decline.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Too few or too many proteins in the output clustering file. Large complexes broken apart.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The number of interactions forwarded into clustering is controlled by the <code>fdr_cutoff</code> value in your user parameters json, which thresholds interactions with CF-MS scores above a particular false discovery rate. False discovery rate (FDR) is calibrated from test positive and negative labeled interactions.</p>
<p>A high FDR cutoff that uses more interactions can cause an overly dense network that, in our experience, can lead to less cleanly distinguished complexes after clustering. However, an overly stringent FDR cutoff reduces recall of complexes.</p>
