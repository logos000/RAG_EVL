<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Cardiac function and morphology by mouse fetal echocardiography can be assessed by scanning the uterus extracted from the abdominal cavity (trans-uterine ultrasound) or the womb (trans-abdominal ultrasound). Advantages of trans-abdominal ultrasound include (1) non-invasive longitudinal analysis at different stages, reducing animal use; and (2) maintenance of natural environment, diminishing perturbations on functional parameters, which are more frequent in trans-uterine conditions. Here we describe both approaches, explaining how to identify congenital cardiac defects and defining the correlation between echocardiography findings and histological analysis.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The protocol below describes the specific steps for the analysis of cardiac structure and function of embryonic (E14.5) mouse models by echocardiography. We have used this protocol specifically for cardiac characterization of <i>Vhl</i>-deficient embryos at E14.5 (<a href="#bib5">Menendez-Montes et al., 2016</a>) which presented dilated ventricular chambers, myocardial thinning and interventricular septal defects associated with cardiac dysfunction. In addition, we have also used this protocol to assess cardiac function in cardiac specific <i>Hif1a</i>-deficient mice (<a href="#bib4">Menendez-Montes et al., 2021</a>). This protocol can be applied to any mouse model at embryonic stages E14.5 and further.</p>
<p>Before starting, first you need to confirm the gestation of timed-pregnant females to be analyzed. In addition, you should have access to a high-resolution ultrasound machine for echocardiography (Vevo 2100, Visualsonics, Canada or similar device) with a 40–50 MHz transducer and an ultrasound probe manipulator, connected to a physiologic-controlled mouse heating platform and linked to an isoflurane-based anesthesia system (<a href="#bib2">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib1">Golden et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib6">Moran et al., 2013</a>). To maintain normal body temperature, apart from the warmed platform, it is useful to maintain the warmed ultrasound gel and to use heat lamps. Additionally, an anesthetic gas scavenging system is also required to reduce the volatile gas from escaping into the room, which prevents operators from inhaling and reduces environmental contamination. Finally, for embryo processing at the end of the procedure, ice-chilled 4% paraformaldehyde, individual flat bottom tubes or plates and 1.5 mL small tubes for embryo genotyping should be prepared. For echocardiography analysis you will need to have access to the Vevo 2100 software from FUJIFILM VisualSonics Inc. Image J program from NIH (<a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ge">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ge</a> J) will be required for histological image analysis of the embryo cardiac sections stained.</p>
<p>Experiments with mice and embryos followed the EU Directive 2010/63EU and Recommendation 2007/526/EC, enforced in Spanish law under Real Decreto 53/2013 and were approved by the authorized Environmental Department of Comunidad de Madrid, Spain, with reference numbers: PROEX 12/14 and PROEX 267/19.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparation of echocardiography station</h3>

<li>Turn on the heating lamp (120W infrared bulb).</li>
<li>Place the ultrasound gel tube on a thermostat device to keep it warmed before application.</li>
<li>Set up the Vevo ultrasound machine.
<ol type="a">
<li>Turn on the system by pressing the switch located on the rear upper left corner.</li>
<li>Turn on the computer and log in with your credentials.</li>
<li>Connect the ultrasound probe and select the measurement package: cardiology</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Set up the anesthesia system.
<ol type="a">
<li>Refill the isoflurane reservoir up to the line indicated with MAX level. Make sure the cap is properly screwed back into the opening.</li>
<li>Check there is enough oxygen in the oxygen cylinder.</li>
<li>Open the oxygen cylinder manifold.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Allow enough distance between the heat lamp and the animal to avoid overheating and risk of burns. A distance of 25–30 cm between the infrared bulb and the animal should be enough to provide heat without causing any burning damage.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Setting up dissection tools and embryo processing material</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15 min</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Organize dissection material
<ol type="a">
<li>Sterilize in advance surgical scissors, fine forceps and Vannas scissors with 70% ethanol for abdominal section procedure, uterus exposure and dissection of the embryos after echocardiography.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Prepare embryo collection tubes/plates and genotyping tubes.
<ol type="a">
<li>Label 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with the pregnant female code followed by E and numbers from 1 to 10 (later adjust to the total number of embryos according to each litter size). These tubes will be used for genotyping material collected from the dissected embryos.</li>
<li>Label flat-bottom tubes or a p12 well plate with the pregnant female code followed by E and numbers from 1 to 10 (later adjusted to the total number of embryos) in each well/flat-bottom tube. Add 2 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS in each well/tube and store at 4°C until embryo dissection. These wells/tubes will be used for embryo fixation prior to histological analysis.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Shaving of the abdominal area of pregnant female</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5 min</div>
<p>To perform trans-abdominal ultrasound in mice it is necessary to remove hair before the scanning because unshaved hair blunts the proper acquisition of echocardiographic images.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Remove hair from the abdominal area of the pregnant female using depilatory cream and an ear swab right before performing the ultrasound or the day before.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> the use of an electric clipper before the depilatory cream facilitates an adequate depilation and improves echocardiography image acquisition.</div>

<h2 id="step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</h2>
<h3 id="sec2.1">Mouse breeding and embryonic gestation</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2–3 weeks (for E14.5 pregnancies)</div>
<p>This part of the protocol includes all the necessary steps to breed the females, check the vaginal plug and establish timed pregnancies.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the breeding process by placing 1 or 2 fertile females in a cage with a single male of the appropriate genotype (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A). Consider that different mouse lines have different reproductive efficiencies. To maximize the breeding process outcome, we recommend adhering to the following guidelines, especially in difficult-to-breed strains:
<figure id="fig1"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1206-Fig1.jpg" alt="Fig1.jpg">

<p>(B) Representative image showing normal aspect of C57B6/N female genitalia.</p>
<p>(C) View of C57B6/N female genitalia with a positive vaginal mating plug (black arrowhead on inset).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol type="a">
<li>Use females that have been pregnant before and efficiently delivered a litter.</li>
<li>Choose animals between 2 and 5 months old. Using too young (below 6 weeks old) or too old (above 30 weeks old) animals might reduce breeding efficiency.</li>
<li>Always introduce the females in the cage containing the male that should have been individualized at least 2 days in advance if coming from a stock cage.</li>
<li>Avoid adding more than 2 females per male at the same time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Every day in the morning (the earlier the better) check the presence of a vaginal plug in the females.
<ol type="a">
<li>Locate the female on a flat surface with the head pointing forward.</li>
<li>Lift the back part of the animal by the tail, exposing the vagina (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B).</li>
<li>Carefully, introduce a p200 sterile pipet tip 1–3 mm inside the vagina to check the presence of a vaginal plug (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C). The tip can be also used to gently expose slightly the vaginal opening to visualize the plug inside.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Different mouse strains produce different types of plugs in terms of size, location and duration. The plug could fall down before the time it is checked. For that reason, we recommend exploring the females early in the morning.</div>
</li>
<li>When the plug is observed, the female will be considered positive, the date recorded and established as embryonic day E0.5. It is recommended to separate the female into a new cage without the male. If no plug is observed, the female should remain in the male cage until a positive plug is observed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> If a female is negative for more than 7–10 consecutive days, it is recommended to separate the animals and use a different female for the plug breeding. However, the original female should be monitored for pregnancy since there is a possibility of getting false negatives (i.e. in case the plug is lost before plug check). We do not recommend using false negative females for echocardiographic analysis as the exact day of pregnancy might not be accurate. Instead, these pregnant females could be used to refresh the mouse colony.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Since a positive plug does not mean pregnancy, the positive females should be monitored for effective pregnancy. Several methods can be used depending on the stage of pregnancy:
<ol type="a">
<li>For early stage pregnancy, monitoring the weight of the female might be helpful. The values could vary depending on the genetic background, e.g., C57BL6/N vs CD1. Generally, for B6N backgrounds an increase in body weight of 1.5g from day E0.5 to E8.5 is usually indicative of pregnancy.</li>
<li>For later stage pregnancies, closer to the echocardiography day (E12.5, E14.5 and so on), observe enlargement and roundness of the female’s lower belly, indicative of pregnancy. Alternatively, hold the female exposing the abdomen and feel the developing embryos. However, this last option should be performed gently and only by experienced personnel, since excessive pressure could damage the embryos and/or cause abortions.</li>

<li>Place the female in the induction chamber and wait until movement stops. This step usually takes between 2 to 3 min.</li>
<li>Transfer the anesthetized female to the mice heating platform that has been prewarmed at 38.6°C and switch the anesthesia flow to the nose adapter located in the platform (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C).
<ol type="a">
<li>Place the female in supine position and gently introduce the nose into the nose adapter.</li>
<li>Using tape, gently attach the rear and front paws of the animal to the electrodes pads and add a small volume of water underneath to improve the ECG signal.</li>
<li>Adjust the isoflurane dose (usually it varies between 1.5%–2.5%) to avoid spontaneous movements but maintaining pedal reflex (light anesthesia plane). This ensures to scan the hearts maintaining physiological conditions as much as possible.</li>
<li>Adjust the heating platform to maintain the mouse temperature in normothermia (36.8°C–38°C).</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The strategy for embryo acquisition in trans-abdominal and trans-uterine analysis is different. Trans-uterine acquisition requires the exposure of the embryos and has a higher risk of body temperature drop after abdominal opening of the pregnant female. For that reason, when performing trans-uterine ultrasound, acquisition begins with the embryo located more distal of the uterine bifurcation, closer to the female ribs. In this way, the exposure of embryos out of the abdominal cavity is reduced, as the operator can gently place them back after each embryo acquisition and proceed from the ovary to the uterine bifurcation.</div>

<li>Once the heart of a given embryo is identified with the ultrasound probe in either trans-abdominal or trans-uterine procedures, continue with a common protocol for functional and structural data acquisition (<a href="#bib3">Liu et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib9">Zhou et al., 2014</a>).

<li>Embryo dissection:
<ol type="a">
<li>In order to collect the embryos, the pregnant females should undergo euthanasia:
<ol type="i">

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>A complete fetal echocardiography analysis of heart structure and function in C57/BL6 E14.5 embryos may successfully provide the following parameters from the M-mode acquisition, with the indicated standard values (<a href="#bib8">Yu et al., 2008</a>).</p>
<p>RVPWd: 0.3mm</p>
<p>IVSd: 0.3mm</p>
<p>LVPWd: 0.3mm</p>
<p>RVIDd: 0.7mm and RVIDs: 0.4mm</p>
<p>LVIDd: 0.8mm and LVIDs: 0.4mm</p>
<p>FS: 44%</p>
<p>EF: 80%</p>
<p>However, cardiac dimensions and functional parameters are significantly variable between different mouse strains, sexes and the developmental stage of analysis. For that reason, it is essential to always acquire control individuals in parallel to the cases, ideally littermates for embryonic studies as described here, in order to normalize each echocardiographic parameter of cases relative to the control group.</p>
<p>In addition, a subjective assessment of the ventricular contractility is recommended to validate the FS (%) and EF (%) obtained in the M-mode analysis. Low ventricular contractile motion should correlate with reduced FS (%) and EF (%) and vice versa. Moreover, a complete evaluation of the heart with the CD to identify flow abnormalities through the cardiac valves and trough pathological communications, as VSD, and at least one PWD acquisition, placed in a semilunar or atrioventricular valve to obtain the embryo heart rate and to evaluate the presence of cardiac arrhythmias should be recorded.</p>
<p>To identify embryo alterations, measurements obtained should be compared with the control littermates and other control embryos of similar gestational stage. Interpretation of the results obtained may require an expert opinion. The following list shows a general interpretation of common abnormal measurements.</p>
<p>Increased PWd indicates cardiac hypertrophy.</p>
<p>Decreased WTd indicates a smaller cardiac size if it is accompanied by a decrease in IDd; and indicates cardiac dilatation if it is accompanied by an increase in IDd.</p>
<p>Increase in IDd indicates cardiac dilatation.</p>
<p>Increased FS or EF indicates higher contractility.</p>
<p>Decreased FS or EF indicates reduced contractility (systolic dysfunction).</p>
<p>Decreased heart rate indicates bradycardia.</p>
<p>Increased heart rate indicates tachycardia.</p>
<p>The presence of irregular waves indicates the presence of a cardiac arrhythmia (using PWD).</p>
<p>The presence of flow through the interventricular septum indicates VSD (using CD).</p>
<p>The described echocardiography protocol has been validated by morphological analysis using histological approaches (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). Our protocol recapitulates the phenotype observed in the histological analysis in the cardiac-specific VHL KO (myocardial thinning and IVS defect) (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>E). The combined histological analysis also allows the quantification of compact myocardium thickness (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>F) and ventricular sphericity (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>G). Moreover, morphological parameters determined by echocardiography correlate with those measured on histological sections (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>H), such as decreased compact myocardium thickness (associated with proliferative defects, among others) and increased sphericity (associated with dilatation of the ventricular chambers).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>The statistical analysis used for determining differences in the echocardiography assessment does not require any specific statistical approach. Statistical test choice (t-test, ANOVA, etc) will be determined by the specific experimental design (usually we use t-test to compare 2 genotypes at a given developmental stage). Sample size must be determined according to the <i>confident level</i> (usually we applied a 95% which corresponds to an alpha risk of 0.05), the <i>statistical power</i> (usually we applied an 85% which corresponds to a beta risk of 0.15), the <i>standard deviation</i> of main parameter which is evaluated and the <i>minimum expected difference</i> between groups. Usually, to detect relevant differences between embryo conditions a sample size of n= 8 may be required as quantitative echocardiography data at this stage commonly shows low dispersion.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Regarding trans-abdominal ultrasound, the main limitation of this protocol is the risk of unmatching the echocardiography data of a given embryo with the histological analysis if embryo dissection is not performed using reference tips as embryonic position relative to ovary, uterus bifurcation or bladder location.</p>
<p>As discussed in the text, the main limitation of trans-uterine ultrasound is associated with inaccurate cardiac function assessment due to temperature drop after sectioning the pregnant female abdomen that usually causes bradycardia and contractility abnormalities.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The progressive drop in temperature associated with abdominal cavity opening might result in bradycardia and the development of cardiac arrhythmias which may be more patent in the last embryos analyzed.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To minimize this problem, we recommend performing trans-abdominal echocardiography whenever possible<b>.</b></p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>When performing trans-abdominal echocardiography, the major challenge is to ensure all embryos has been scanned and the precise location (E1, E2, etc) to correlate the ultrasound phenotype with successive ultrasounds of the same embryos or with the histological assessment and genotype.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To ensure proper correlation between analyzed embryos by trans-abdominal ultrasound and histology/genotyping during the dissection of the embryos after echocardiography acquisition, we recommend to count the total number of embryos on each uterus horn from the uterus bifurcation to the ovary before taking it out of the female. In addition, we suggest to keep the ovary in the right side of the uterus and remove the ovary in the left end. In this way you will have a reference between echocardiography acquisition and anatomical location.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Sometimes, when dissecting out and saving the yolk sac, maternal contaminant tissue can be taken together, especially small fragments of uterine wall or placenta. This can lead to errors in genotyping.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To minimize this problem, we recommend using another part of the embryo for genotyping. For example, a piece of the embryo tail or limbs can be used once all the extra-embryonic and maternal structures have been removed.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Depending on how the image has been acquired, the information about the scale (microns/pixel) is not included in the metadata and does not show up when opening the image on ImageJ.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If this happens, the information can be found in the microscope software once the camera and the objective are selected. However, it is always recommended to save the images in the raw format from the microscope, that usually can be opened on ImageJ. A second option, when working with uncalibrated images, is to use scale bar. Since the real length of the scale bar is known, it can be measured with the “line” tool on ImageJ to obtain its length in pixels. Then, both values are entered in the “Set scale” window.</p>
