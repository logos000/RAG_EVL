<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Alveolar type II cells (AT2) are stem cells of lung epithelium. To study these cells, we developed protocols to isolate primary AT2 and test the effects of potential niche factors in regulating the AT2 progenitor functions. AT2 freshly isolated from mouse lungs are grown in 2D or 3D culture. AT2 are able to differentiate into alveolar type I cells (AT1) in these conditions. S1P or an inhibitor of S1P signaling is added in culture to modulate AT2 to AT1 transition.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Chen et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>All studies using animals have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Prepare type II cell lineage traced mice</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 weeks</div>
<ol>
<li>Prepare tamoxifen solution
<ol type="a">
<li>Make 20 mg/mL tamoxifen stock solution in corn oil. Incubate the stock solution at 45°C for 6–7 h and vortex occasionally to dissolve the tamoxifen powder.</li>
<li>Aliquot and store the stock solution at −20°C for several months.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Tamoxifen is light-sensitive and should be wrapped in foil or kept in dark.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Inject tamoxifen to CreER induced lineage tracing mice: Adult mice at 8–16 weeks of age are intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with tamoxifen every other day at 0.2 mg/g for 4 times. Mice are used 4–7 days after the last injection.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> AT2 cell isolation done in mice at this age range does not show difference in yield and purity between sex. However, the sex of the mice should always be taken into consideration when designing the experiments.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>For type II cell lineage labeling, we used <i>SpC-CreER/ROSA-Tomato</i> mice or <i>SpC-CreER/mTmG</i> mice (<a href="#bib1">Barkauskas et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib8">Rock et al., 2011</a>) (<a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2020</a>).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The reason that we use AT2 lineage tracing mice is because by this it is easier for us to visualize AT2 in culture, especially 3D culture. If other approaches are available to visualize the cells, then lineage tracing mice are not required.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Prepare reagents for type II cell isolation and culture</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–2 days</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Prepare for type II cell isolation:
<ol type="a">
<li>Prepare other reagents and materials for isolating type II cells:
<ol type="i">
<li>HEPES-buffered DMEM: See “<a href="#materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</a>” for details.</li>
<li>Dispase (50 units/mL, approximately 2.5 mL needed per mouse)</li>
<li>70 μm cell strainer ( Corning Falcon)</li>
<li>20 μm nylon gauze (Fisher)</li>
<li>DNase I (Sigma)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Coat tissue culture dishes with CD45 and CD32 antibodies. Coat 100-mm tissue culture plates with 42 μg CD45 and 16 μg CD32 in 7 mL PBS for 24–48 h at 4°C. Before use, wash the plates twice with PBS and once with HEPES-buffered DMEM.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Prepare for 2D type II cell culture:
<ol type="a">
<li>Autoclave round glass coverslips for 20 min in glass beakers to sterilize. 15 mm round glass coverslips are used in 24-well plates and 18 mm coverslips are used in 12-well plates.</li>
<li>Let the coverslips cool down to 20°C–25°C.</li>
<li>Used sterile forceps to transfer coverslips to culture wells.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li>Prepare for 3D culture:
<ol type="a">
<li>Grow Mlg cells (mouse lung fibroblasts, ATCC) (<a href="#bib6">Lee et al., 2014</a>) in Mlg cell culture medium (See “<a href="#materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</a>” for details). The cells usually take ~3 days after thawing to reach 80% confluency. Subculturing the cells at 1:2 to 1:4 ratios when necessary.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> we used cells at passage 6 or less.</div>
</li>
<li>Prepare other reagents and materials for 3D culture
<ol type="i">
<li>Matrigel: When opening a new bottle (5 mL or larger volume) of Matrigel, submerge the bottle in ice or keep at 4°C for 5 to 18 h to thaw slowly. After the whole bottle is completely thawed, use cold tips to aliquot Matrigel into cold sterile 1.5 mL tubes and keep the aliquots at −20°C. Keep the Matrigel on ice during aliquoting.</li>
<li>3D culture media (for 3D co-culture of type II cells and Mlg): See “<a href="#materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</a>” for details.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Equilibrate 6.5 mm Transwell polycarbonate membrane inserts (0.45 μm pore size, Corning) in 24 well plates. Add 0.6 mL 3D culture media to the wells and 100 μL of media inside the insert. Keep the plates in a 37°C cell culture incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1–18 h.</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5–7 h for isolation, 2–3 days to determine the purity</div>
<p>In this step, we will first isolate alveolar type II cells from mouse lungs. Next, we will purify the cell population by magnetic beads sorting or by flow cytometry sorting.</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolate type II cells from mouse lungs (See <a href="#mmc1">Methods Video S1</a>)
<ol type="a">
<li>Perfuse the lung with 10 mL PBS at 20°C–25°C via the pulmonary artery (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A).

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Isolating type II cells from mouse lung.</div>
<p>(A) Dissecting the mouse lung for type II cell isolation. Step 1: perfuse the lung with 10 mL PBS via the pulmonary artery. Step 2: inject 2 mL dispase through the trachea followed by 0.5 mL agarose (2% in PBS).</p>
<p>(B) Isolated type II cells were fixed on glass slides by cytospin centrifugation and stained with antibody to type II cell marker Sp-C. Scale bar, 40 μm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Instill 2 mL dispase into the lung through trachea followed by 0.5 mL melted agarose (2% in PBS) (~45°C) (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A).</li>
<li>Immediately cover the lung with ice for 2 min to let the agarose solidify and seal the upper airways.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> 0.5 mL agarose (2% in PBS) (~45°C) injected after the dispase seal the upper airways and block most of the airway cells from dissociation. In this way, we minimize the contamination of club cells in our type II cell isolation.</div>
</li>
<li>Tie the trachea and remove the lung from the mouse using forceps. Incubate the lung in 0.5 mL dispase in a 15 mL tube for 45 min at 20°C–25°C.</li>
<li>Transfer the lung to a 60 mm tissue culture dish containing 5 mL of HEPES-buffered DMEM with 100 unit/mL DNase I. Gently tease the lung tissue into small pieces (smaller than 2 mm<sup>3</sup>) from the bronchi. Cut 2–3 mm from the tip of a 1 mL pipette tip and use it to pipette the tissue pieces up and down to further dissociate the cells. Incubate the cells at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.</li>
<li>Filter the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer and then nylon gauze (20 μm pore size) to get single cell suspension in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> After the serial filtration, most cells left in the mixture should be single cells. To minimize the cell loss, after the 5 mL cells are filtered through the 70 μm cell strainer, 1 mL of additional HEPES-buffered DMEM can be added to the 60 mm tissue culture dish to collect residual cells and filter through the same cell strainer to be combined with the rest of the cells.</div>
</li>
<li>Centrifuge cells at 130 × <i>g</i> for 8 min at 4°C in a centrifuge suitable for 15 mL centrifuge tubes.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We used a relatively low speed (130 × <i>g</i>). In this way, most of the type I cells will be removed.</div>
</li>
<li>Re-suspend cells in 5 mL HEPES-buffered DMEM.</li>
<li>Place cells in tissue culture plates coated with CD45 and CD32 antibodies.</li>
<li>Incubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 h.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Occasionally, cell aggregates are seen after 1 h of incubation (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). In this case, add an additional aliquot of DNase I directly to the plate. Gently rock and swirl the plate to make it evenly disperse into the medium and incubate the plate for another 10 min. Proceeding with cell aggregates would compromise the purity and yield of the isolation.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<h3 id="sec4.1">2D culture</h3>
<p>Type II cells do not maintain as stem cells in 2D culture, and the purpose of the 2D culture is to study the type II cell differentiation process into type I cells. Type II cells remain to be cuboidal shape in the first day. After 48–72 h, the cells start to change into flat type I-like cell shape. At 24 h post culture, many cells still maintain their expression of type II cell marker Sp-C, but after 5 days, the cells start to express type I cell markers HopX and Ager (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Co-expression of AT2 and AT1 markers are observed in cells during the transition. By day 7, almost all cells should have adopted the AT1 cell-like morphology and lost Sp-C expression.</p>
<p>If S1P is included in the medium, more of the type II cells can convert into type I cells. In contrast, if JTE-013 is included in the culture, type II to type I cell transition is disrupted (See <a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec4.2">3D culture</h3>
<p>Type II cell derived colonies can be visualized by the fluorescent lineage labeling (e.g., GFP for cells isolated from <i>SpC-CreER/mTmG</i> mice). Small colonies are usually formed approximately 1 week after culture and continue to expand in the following 1–2 weeks. 2–3 weeks after culture is a good timepoint to assess the formation of organoids, including number, size, cell composition, etc. The Matrigel plugs can be fixed, paraffin embedded, and stained for type II and type I cell markers. The colonies are alveoli-like cysts with some cells lining the lumen expressing type I cell marker T1α, and cells surround the lumen expressed type II cell marker Sp-C (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).</p>
<p>Different from 2D culture, some type II cells maintain the stem cell properties in 3D culture as they can be passaged. To passage the type II cells, organoids in Matrigel can be disassociated using dispase and type II cell can be FACS sorted based on their fluorescence signal and replated with fresh fibroblast cells (Mlg or PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> fibroblast cells), to grow in to new organoids (<a href="#bib1">Barkauskas et al., 2013</a>).</p>
<p>If JTE-013 is included in the culture, there will be less type I cells in the alveoli-like cysts (See <a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2020</a>)</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The above discussed type II cell yield and purity is based on isolation performed on young (8–12 weeks) and uninjured mice. We typically get over 85% pure type II cells after negative selection using the CD32/CD45 plates, as assessed by SP-C staining. Both aging and lung injury could reduce the purity at this step. Therefore, it is important to use beads sorting or through FACS, to further purify the cells.</p>
<p>In 2D culture, a lot of cells would be dead after the first 1–2 days of culture.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Low survival rate of 2D culture (step 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>For 2D culture, to increase survival rate, it is important not to disturb cells too much. Let cells sit for 48 h, then change media. Alternatively, the culture dish or glass slips used for growing type II cells can be coated with collagen at 0.01% (w/v) or coated with a thin layer of 50% Matrigel. However, with Matrigel coating, the cells sometimes did not attach to the coverslips and were washed away while proceed with antibody staining.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>For 2D culture, sometimes when the culture condition is sub-optimal, the WT control type II cells remain to be cuboidal shape after 4–5 days of culture (Morphology remain similar to <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A even after 4–5 days culture) (step 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If this happens, the culture needs to be started over with fresh medium.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Type II cells do not attach well on gelatin coated coverslips (step 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Thoroughly wash coverslips by heating the coverslips in 1 N HCl at 50°C–60°C for 4–16 h for a better coating and coat coverslips with 0.01% collagen (w/v) instead of gelatin.</p>
