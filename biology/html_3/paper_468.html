<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The transition from quiescence to activation in radial neural stem cells (rNSCs) is a key first step in the process of adult neurogenesis, which can be monitored in the context of circuit activation in live tissue by whole-cell patch-clamp recording of membrane potentials of rNSCs in acute brain slices. However, membrane recordings in small non-neuronal cells such as rNSCs can be challenging. Here, we describe the preparation of materials, recording and stimulation protocols, and analyses necessary to evaluate the efficacy of activity-dependent control of rNSC behavior.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Asrican et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Performing electrophysiological recordings from rNSCs is similar to standard techniques used for recording neurons. The protocol here makes some adjustments to typical electrophysiology methods, due to the smaller size and unusual membrane properties of rNSCs (such as low resistence, low capacitance, and non-spiking) as compared to typical mature neurons.</p>
<p>Preparation of laboratory animals, and viral reagents specific to the experiment should be planned in accordance with the research questions. The choice of an appropriate method of stimulating specific circuits is extensively discussed in the literature. Here, we describe use of a recombinant CCK-Cre mouse and viral delivery of floxed chemogenetic DREADD constructs (<a href="#bib2">Armbruster et al., 2007</a>), which we have found particularly useful, as fast time-locked stimulation protocols are not necessary nor recommended when recording non-neuronal cells that activate on much slower time scales.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Breeding of research animals</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2–6 months prior to rNSC recording</div>
<p>Most research laboratories interested in circuit-based regulation of neural stem cell activation likely already have ongoing breeding programs using transgenic mouse lines appropriate for their own research questions. We have described here one particular mouse line for Cre-dependent control of CCK interneurons, and one particular reporter line for visualizing the rNSCs and targeting for electrophysiology.</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain and cross stock mouse lines.
<ol type="a">
<li>Obtain reporter mice for expressing GFP in rNSCs: such as Nestin-GFP (Jax).</li>
<li>Obtain recombinant mice for circuit-based manipulations.
<ol type="i">
<li>Several reliable Cre lines are available from Jax or other sources. CCK-Cre mice will be used in this example.
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Alternative methods of circuit manipulation are available, including Flp lines as well as viral delivery systems utilizing specific promoters if that is preferred.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Cross Nestin-GFP mice with homozygous CCK-Cre breeders to get double transgenic CCK-Cre::Nestin-GFP pups.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Phenotyping or Genotyping
<ol type="a">
<li>Nestin-GFP pups may be phenotyped. Toe clippings at p7<sup>+</sup> can be placed under any upright or inverted microscope using a GFP filter set and identified by fluorescence intensity.</li>
<li>CCK-Cre pups can be bred from homozygous parents. No genotyping is necessary. If homozygous parents are unavailable, standard PCR techniques will suffice.</li>
<li>Animals ideally around 2–4 months of age of both sexes can be used for experiments. Earlier than 1 months of age, the Nestin-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells are too dense to be selectively identifiable and may not be considered “adult” stem cells. Animals older than 6 months of age increases the difficulty of patching cells in acute brain slices but is not impossible.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Viral injection</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 weeks prior to rNSC recording</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>AAVs are easily obtained from commercial sources and can be injected with high accuracy into brain regions of interest, such as into the hilus of the dentate gyrus.
<ol type="a">
<li>Obtain and dilute viral aliquots in PBS. In this protocol we used AAV2-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry (AddGene), which is a Cre-dependent version of an excitatory DREADD virus, which in our case will be expressed in CCK type interneurons.</li>
<li>Inject viral constructs using stereotaxic coordinates AP −2.0 mm, ML ± 1.5 mm, DV −2.1 mm. If injecting into the dentate gyrus, it is important to use small volumes (∼300 nL) and low titers (∼1 × 1,011 viral genomes/mL) to avoid rNSC cell death and loss of neurogenic progeny (<a href="#bib4">Johnston et al., 2020</a>). See <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A for a successful viral injection inducing selective expression of the DREADD construct in hilar CCK cells.

<p>(A) Sample confocal image of an antibody-stained dentate gyrus expressing hM3Dq-mCherry (red) construct in the hilar CCK cells from a CCK-Cre::Nestin-GFP animal. rNSCs express GFP (green).

<p>(B) Views from the dorsal surface (top) and caudal viewpoint (bottom) of brain blocking in preparation for semi-transverse vibratome sectioning. This method is useful for preserving the laminar orientation along the region in interest within the hippocampal curvature. Adjustments can be made to optimize slice angles to align best with whichever particular stereotaxis coordinates were used during viral injection. (i) Bisect the brain along the midline using a standard single edged safety-razor. (ii) Make an angled cut about 20 degrees off from coronal (red angle) through the cerebellum and outer tip of cortex, with the blade tilted “inward” about 20 degrees from vertical (green angle). (iii) Repeat on opposite hemisphere. Gently glue the cut (cerebellar) surface to the vibratome plate for sectioning.</p>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Confirm accuracy of viral injection. Mistargeting of the hilus can easily result in unintended infection of CA3 pyramidal cells, or dentate granule cells. A practice injection is recommended in order to adjust the coordinates to ensure only hilar CCK cells become labeled. Injection of fluorescent beads, or a dye, such as Fast Green can quickly inform on anatomical localization. Infected cells can be seen after ∼7–10 days post injection, and typically are used around 2 weeks post injection. Healthy cells should appear morphologically intact, with rounded soma. Expression of hM3Dq-mCherry can be punctate while still functional. Excessive blebbing may indicate toxicity.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Prepare stock solutions</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 day prior to rNSC recording</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Healthy brain slices require careful preparation of cutting solutions, recovery solutions, and recording solutions. These stocks can be prepared ahead of time, and then adjusted for osmolarity and pH on the day of recording.
<ol type="a">
<li>Prepare 200 mL of 1 molar stocks of:
<ol type="i">
<li>MgSO<sub>4</sub>

<p>Preparation and careful sectioning of brain slices using a vibratome is key to preserving healthy tissue suitable for patching. Pay attention to the pH and osmolarity of solutions to avoid unnecessary cell death.</p>

<li>Measure 180 mL of NMDG stock solution. Bubble with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for &gt; 10 min at 22°C.</li>
<li>Measure 90 mL of HEPES holding solution. Bubble with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for &gt; 10 min at 22°C.</li>
<li>pH the NMDG and HEPES solutions to 7.25 using HCl. Overshooting pH can be compensated with KOH (for NMDG) or NaOH (for HEPES holding). Avoid adding NaOH to NMDG solution to keep Na<sup>+</sup> concentration low.</li>
<li>Adjust osmolarity to 300 mOsm.
<ol type="i">
<li>Measure the slightly overconcentrated solutions with an osmometer.</li>
<li>Reduce osmolarity by adding volumes of ddH<sub>2</sub>O.<br> For NMDG; volume needed (mL) ∼= (Osm × 180/300 − 180) × 0.9<br> For HEPES; volume needed (mL) ∼= (Osm × 90/300 − 90) × 0.9</li>
<li>Typically, this will bring the total volume to 200 mL of NMDG, and 100 mL of HEPES.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Place NMDG solution in −20°C or −80°C freezer until very cold (not frozen). This usually takes about 5–10 min.</li>

<p>The bioelectric state of the cellular membrane has been shown to control cell behavior and proliferation in many cell types through regulation of ion channels or pumps in the plasma membrane (<a href="#bib1">Aprea and Calegari, 2012</a>; <a href="#bib5">Levin, 2014</a>). Cells undergoing division events require depolarization for the division process and will otherwise remain hyperpolarized during the non-division parts of the cell cycle. In Nestin-GFP<sup>+</sup> rNSCs, electrophysiological patch recordings during chemogenetic stimulation allows monitoring of the membrane potential (Vm) as a readout of the stem cell activation state. This section assumes readers have some general knowledge of the patch-clamp technique and will therefore highlight specificities for recording rNSCs.</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The rNSCs are small, and therefore the user will need to pull microelectrode tips slightly smaller than typically used for neuronal recordings.</div>
</li>
<li>Approach cells under DIC illumination with moderate positive electrode pressure to pass through the granule cell layer, and then reduce to weak positive pressure when in proximity to the cell of interest. rNSCs do not always form an obvious dimple in the membrane as a neuron might, but they are somewhat hardy, and will withstand slight touches from the pipette tip itself. Cells that shift entirely when nudged are probably dead and have overly hardened membranes or shriveled appearance.</li>
<li>Zero the offset, apply very weak suction for 2–4 s while adjusting the holding potential in order to form a seal. Gohm seals should form quickly in most circumstances. Do not over suction, as the cellular material is very limited.</li>
<li>Set holding potential to -75 mV.</li>
<li>Use slight but quick suction in conjunction with the zap function (1 V pulse) to break in. Use the smallest duration zap possible (typically around 0.5 ms), and progressively increase it until break in has been accomplished. rNSCs have very little capacitance, and low resistance, and therefore look very square upon break in. Whole-cell parameters typically obtained by a square voltage deflection (for example, using “cell” mode in the seal-test window of pClamp) will not able to provide capacitance and time constant measurements.</li>
<li>Switch to I=0 mode and monitor resting membrane potential. An average of 10 runs of a 200 ms sweep will suffice. Vm should be between -70 and -90 mV.</li>

<li>Change to current clamp mode, and apply a series of current pulses (100 ms pulse starting at -30 pA and increasing by 5 pA steps) to monitor voltage responses. These should be small and no rectifying voltage deflection at higher current steps should be visible.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Successful injection of virus containing hM3Dq excitatory DREADD will specifically label CCK cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in red, while the stem cells in the layer bordering the granule cells express GFP and have long processes that extend through the granule cell layer (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A). Membrane potential recordings from these cells should be about -70 to -80 mV at baseline and will begin to slowly depolarize within 8–10 min in response to activation of CCK neurons (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>B, 2C, <a href="#fig3">and 3</a>).</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 3. Quantification schemes for analyzing rNSC membrane potential responses</div>
<p>(A) Calculation of depolarization magnitude. Baseline level is defined as the mean of the last third of the data points during unstimulated recording. Depolarized level is the maximum of the smoothed response (red line) after chemogenetic stimulation. The amplitude of response is then determined by taking the difference between baseline and depolarized levels.</p>
<p>(B) Schematic for determining the delay time for rNSCs to respond to chemogenetic stimulation of neuronal circuitry. Data are fit with a Sigmoid function, and the fit parameter for the midpoint of inflection is obtained. Taking the first derivative of the Sigmoid provides the slope for a tangent line through the midpoint, which is then used to calculate the intercept point where the membrane potential deflects from baseline. Time from CNO application until deflection provides the delay parameter.</p>

<p>Multiple cells can be recorded and then analyzed using commercial or customized analysis routines. Here, custom routines for Igor Pro are used. Alternatives do exist, such as using ClampFit, which comes with pClamp software (Molecular Devices). After discarding recordings considered unstable or unfit for analysis, summary data and plots can be assembled. It is typical of rNSCs to exhibit some diversity in responsiveness and many may display no change in membrane potential at all. With enough cells, it is useful to report the percent of cells that respond to stimulation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Import ABF2 files.
<ol type="a">
<li>pClamp data files are written using the ABF2 data format, which can be read by a variety of software platforms, or one can be developed independently using published header and data structure information from Molecular Devices.</li>
<li>Igor Pro is a highly customizable data processing and data presentation software similar in some respects to MATLAB and is highly recommended.</li>
<li>Neuromatic is a collection of publicly available software tools built for Igor Pro by <a href="http://ThinkRandom.com">ThinkRandom.com</a> (<a href="#bib6">Rothman and Silver, 2018</a>), and allows loading and browsing electrophysiology datasets, and can provide most of the necessary analysis routines. Some additional programming may still be necessary and can be accomplished using the commands found in the Igor help files.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion
<ol type="a">
<li>Check the initial membrane potential of the cells immediately following break in. Cells that are already depolarized beyond -65 mV may have a leaky seal and should be discarded.</li>
<li>Determine from the current/voltage step data whether the electrophysiology parameters are appropriate for stem cells (low resistance, low capacitance, non-rectifying, no voltage-dependent currents). Presence of a sodium spike indicates a neuron or neuroblast recording. Presence of an outward rectifying voltage deflection at high current pulses indicates recording from transient progenitor cell. Discard as necessary.</li>
<li>Determine stability of baseline. Typically, small membrane fluctuations of ∼5 mV are acceptable. Drifting baselines can sometimes be corrected post-hoc if not too severe. Rapidly fluctuating baseline recordings indicate poor seals, and data from these cells should be discarded.</li>
<li>Membrane resistance can be calculated by analyzing the voltage response to the monitoring pulse found at the end of the 30 s data sweep. Sudden increase in the voltage response to the pulse is considered blockage of the electrode and should be discarded. Slow increases in resistance during the depolarization event are acceptable, as some membrane channels (presumably potassium channels) close as the rNSCs become activated.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Concatenate data sweeps.
<ol type="a">
<li>Data files of membrane potential were collected as 30 s sweeps plus a small monitoring pulse, for a total length of 31.2 s.</li>
<li>A simple analysis routine to strip the last 1.2 s of data from each sweep will result in 30 s pieces of data.</li>
<li>Concatenate all 20 of the trimmed data files to get a full 10 min of data in that run.</li>
<li>Repeat for the additional runs, and then create a final concatenation that encompasses the entire dataset. Plotting this as a graph is useful to see the time-course of depolarization. Make note of the experimental conditions such as addition of pharmacological agents and indicate application times on the graph. Discard the dataset if the depolarization is too sudden (within 10 s), or if the membrane potential fluctuates too erratically.</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>Determine baseline Vm level.
<ol type="i">
<li>The first 10 min of recording should have been baseline recording (in ACSF, or in receptor antagonist condition). Occasionally, there is some drift at the beginning of the recording as the cell stabilizes, so avoid analyzing data values at the beginning of the run.</li>

<li>Measure response Vm level.</li>
<li>Typical recording have about 30 min of data in the CNO condition. The precise time point at which cells start to respond is variable, so therefore it is suggested to find the peak response instead of averaging at a particular timepoint.</li>
<li>Apply a box car smoothing (running average) of 20,000 points (∼20 s) to remove high frequency recording noise without distorting the shape of the slow depolarization waveform. The built in Igor Pro function, “Smooth,” can perform this operation.</li>

<li>If a rNSC responds to circuit stimulation, the time-course of the response follows a typical “S” shape that can then be used to quantify the time it takes a cell to begin responding after CNO application.</li>
<li>Use Igor Pro’s built in curve-fitting procedures to fit the dataset to a sigmoid function. Take care to include a data mask to exclude parts of the dataset that may be causing erroneous fits to the data. The sigmoid function is defined as: y = K0+K1/(1+exp(-(x-K2)/K3)).</li>
<li>Use the outputted Fitting Coefficient K2 as the halfway time point (Xhalf) of the sigmoid inflection.</li>
<li>Take the derivative of the sigmoid fit to get a slope curve of the sigmoid. The built in Igor Pro function, “Differentiate,” can provide this operation. The slope (Tan_slope) at point Xhalf is the slope of a tangent line to the sigmoid at the inflection point.</li>
<li>Use the formula for a line, Y = mX + b, with Y = fit[Xhalf], X = Xhalf, and m = Tan_slope, to find the “b” value corresponding to the Y-intercept of the tangent line through the inflection point.</li>
<li>Again, use the formula for a line Y = mX + b, with Y = Vm_baseline, m = Tan_slope, and b = Y_intercept to calculate the X_initiation time point. (The time at which the membrane potential begins to change).</li>
<li>Use Time_delay = X_initiation − Time_CNO to calculate the delay time.</li>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings are a powerful quantitative measurement of rNSC activation. However, as it is only possible to record a few cells per day, it can be a somewhat low-throughput method. With multiple experimental conditions or pharmacological manipulations, achieving adequate number of cells for statistical analysis can be time-consuming. If experimental outcomes are particularly obvious, a minimum of 7 cells from 3 animals is recommended. More will certainly be needed if the effect is less obvious, and calculations of statistical power may be of assistance in determining what might be a necessary “n” value.</p>
<p>Reliability of quantifications depends on the health and quality of brain slices and minimization of electrical noise on the microscope rig. Drifting of the membrane potential can sometimes be compensated algorithmically, to a limited extent, but is usually avoided, and such data occasionally need to be excluded.</p>
<p>Ultimately, membrane potential is a proxy for stem cell activation and is not a direct measurement of cell cycle progression. While many publications have provided evidence that depolarization is important for proliferation (<a href="#bib1">Aprea and Calegari, 2012</a>; <a href="#bib5">Levin, 2014</a>), it would be the best if electrophysiological phenomena in rNSCs or other cell types are supported by standard proliferation assays, such as by immunohistochemical labeling. See <a href="#bib3">Asrican et al. (2020)</a> for examples.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Poor slice quality/health when attempting patch rNSCs (step 7 of <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Health of cut brain slices decreases with time after slicing on the vibratome. The best recordings (step 8) are typically made early, within the first 3–4 h after slicing, with decreasing chances of success as the day progresses. Having recording materials and reagents prepared ahead of time is beneficial.</p>
<p>Perfusion systems to provide adequate amounts of oxygenated ACSF are critical. Follow typical electrophysiology recording recommendations to ensure good conditions. If tubing is clogged, or suction fails, rNSCs will begin to die and depolarize artificially. Fresh IV drippers and drip-speed regulators are inexpensive (see <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a>) and should be replaced weekly. Tubing and chambers should be cleaned and kept free of bacteria.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Perfusion artifacts are present during the analysis of the whole-cell electrophysiological recordings (step 4 of Quantification and analysis).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Suction systems can sometimes cause capacitance artifacts as the level of solution in the recording chamber is suddenly changed. Large transient artifacts can occasionally cause the analysis routines to pick up artificial maximums. Manual smoothing or artifact removal algorithms may be needed to correct this. Ideally, a quiet recording chamber (see <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a>) and careful cleaning and placement of the suction apparatus during acquisition can minimize perfusion artifacts.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Loss of the rNSC during the recording due to positional drift of the patch pipette (step 8 of <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The rNSCs in the hippocampus are quite small, and drift in the slice tissue can pull cells off the recording pipette. A good slice anchor can help minimize drift (see Additional Laboratory Equipment Table), with any remaining motion corrected by micropipette position adjustments during the experiment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, solution changes can occasionally cause motion disturbances, or swelling/contraction of the tissue may occur if osmolarity is changed suddenly. Avoid excessive use of DMSO as a solvent, as it often disturbs cell membranes and causes tissue swelling. Limit the volumes of water added to the ACSF. Mix pharmacological agents at high stock concentrations (∼1,000×) and use ACSF as the solvent if possible.</p>
