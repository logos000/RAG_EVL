<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol explains how to extract pollen from fossil insects with subsequent descriptions of pollen treatment. We also describe how to document morphological and ultrastructural features with light-microscopy and electron microscopy. It enables a taxonomic assignment of pollen that can be used to interpret flower-insect interactions, foraging and feeding behavior of insects, and the paleoenvironment. The protocol is limited by the state of the fossil, the presence/absence of pollen on fossil specimens, and the availability of extant pollen for comparison.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00629-8/sref8">Wappler et al.

<h3 id="sec3.1">Detection and extraction of pollen from fossil insects</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> minutes to hours depending on the number of specimens studied and the number of pollen extracted. To locate and extract a single pollen from a single specimen takes about 5 min.</div>
<p>This step details how to detect fossil pollen <sup>1)</sup> adhering to the exoskeleton of fossil insects or <sup>2)</sup> preserved inside the body of fossil insects, and how to extract them so the pollen can be studied with LM, SEM, and TEM.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the fossil specimen under the dissecting microscope (stereomicroscope). Adjust the magnification and focus so the insect (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A) or particular parts of it (leg [<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B], abdomen, head, etc.) are clearly visible.

<p>(B) Close-up of (A) showing part of leg observed with stereomicroscope using normal incident light.</p>
<p>(C) Same area as in (B) observed with stereomicroscope using epi-fluorescence illumination. Note how adhering pollen grains illuminate under the epi-fluorescence light source.</p>
<p>(D) Close-up of (C) showing a clump of pollen.</p>
<p>(E) Drop of glycerine on a LM glass slide. Make the drop small and place it in the middle of the slide. Name the slide appropriately.</p>

<p>(I) Fossil fly observed with stereomicroscope using normal incident light. The thin chitin layer in the gut/abdomen region has been removed in four places with a narrow teasing needle to reveal the otherwise hidden gut contents (yellow; black arrow).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>To discover pollen adhering to the exoskeleton of a fossil insect turn on the epi-fluorescence illumination. The pollen grains will illuminate when they are hit by the fluorescence beam (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>C and 1D).</li>
<li>Place a small drop of glycerine on a LM microscope slide (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E) and keep it close by.</li>
<li>While observing through the stereomicroscope use a teasing needle or micromanipulator (with nasal hair; <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>F) to extract pollen from the exoskeleton of the fossil insect.
<ol type="a">
<li>For dry specimens it is more efficient to dip the needle/micromanipulator into glycerine before you touch the pollen that is adhering to the insect as the pollen grain might otherwise be “blown” away due to electrostatics.
<ol type="i">
<li>It might be necessary to loosen the pollen from the surface of the insect using a teasing needle and then pick it up with the micromanipulator (nasal hair).</li>
<li>Push the pollen grain with the wet micromanipulator, tip of the nasal hair, along the surface and it will eventually adhere to the hair.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For wet specimens preserved in glycerine make sure to quickly but carefully dry most of the glycerine from the surface of the insect with a paper napkin.
<ol type="i">
<li>Take care to let the liquid be absorbed by the tissue and do not scrape the surface of the fossil.</li>
<li>Then use a teasing needle and/or micromanipulator (nasal hair) to extract the pollen.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Transfer and place the pollen into the glycerine drop on the LM microscope slide.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> When you dip the tip of the micromanipulator into the glycerine drop, the pollen will automatically detach from the hair and remain in the drop.</div>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Check if the abdomen is flat or protruding.

<ol start="7">
<li>Place a small drop of glycerine on a LM microscope slide and keep it close by (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E).</li>
<li>Use a fine teasing needle to puncture the abdomen (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>I) and scrape out part of the gut content.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Previous work on pollen grains extracted from fossil insects (e.g., <a href="#bib2">Krassilov and Rasnitsyn, 1997</a>; <a href="#bib3">Krassilov et al., 1999</a>, <a href="#bib4">2003</a>, <a href="#bib5">2007</a>; <a href="#bib6">Tekleva 2015</a>) have not provided any detailed accounts on how to observe, extract, or investigate the pollen. This protocol provides clear written instructions and supportive illustrations enabling scientists to successfully extract and analyze fossil pollen from the exoskeleton or internal organs of fossil insects. When the pollen grains have been studied via the combined LM, SEM, and TEM protocol presented herein, their morphological and ultrastructural characteristics can be used to systematically place the pollen and make conclusions about their paleovegetational, paleophytogeographical, paleoecological (flower–insect interactions), and paleoclimatological significance.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The method is limited by the state of the fossil and the presence/absence of pollen on fossil specimens. Not all fossil insects will have adhering fossil pollen. Also, the preservation and the mineral combination might affect the possibility of extracting pollen from the exoskeleton of fossil insects. It might complicate the extraction of the pollen and more force would be needed to loosen the microfossils from the insect. Using teasing needles for this purpose might leave permanent scars in the fossil specimen. If the gut contents of fossil insects are preserved or not may not always be detectable via observation with a stereomicroscope, even when using epi-fluorescence illumination, since the chitin layer might conceal the gut contents. If the stomach/abdomen region of a fossil insect looks as though it is protruding or relatively swollen, it might be worthwhile to puncture it with a teasing needle and scrape out some material to check for pollen. Again, this will leave a permanent scar in the fossil specimen.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>There is no pollen observed on/inside the fossil insect (step 2).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Not all fossil insects will have adhering pollen, it is an uncommon occurrence. Replace the fossil insect with another specimen and focus on groups that are presently known to come into contact with pollen, incl. bees, wasps, butterflies, beetles, and flies.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The pollen looks dirty or the surface of the grain seems to be covered by foreign particles (step 17).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Some organic particles can be hard to remove without physical force. After acetolysis, push the pollen grain towards the margin of the glycerine drop and use the hair to press on the pollen grain while rubbing back and forth and scrape off the foreign particles.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The mold is overfilled with resin, the plastic pipette section is floating, and the pollen grains are out of sight (step 35).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Locate the pollen, wait until it sinks towards the bottom, then use a micro-pipette to carefully suck away extra resin from the embedding mold. Remove resin until the plastic pipette section settles. Use the micromanipulator (nasal-hair) to transport the pollen into the center of the plastic pipette section.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The resin is not hardening within the given time period (step 38).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The polymerization period must be prolonged. The resin might not be properly mixed, or the amount of accelerator was insufficient. Keep the resin inside the oven until it is completely polymerized (up to a few days, if needed). If the resin is not polymerizing at all, the chemical components used might have been flawed. Mix a new embedding medium with fresh components and transfer the fossil pollen into the new resin.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>When the specimen block including the pollen is re-embedded the pollen grain is no longer positioned at the appropriate level for sectioning (step 42)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To reach the pollen grain within the specimen block, trimming must be conducted prior to semi-thin sectioning. Trimming is repeated as in step 41, but also the tip of the pyramid is cut away until the appropriate level within the sample has been reached. Trim close to the pollen grain but make sure not to cut into it. Continue trimming using the ultramicrotome.</p>
