<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I describe a prioritization protocol for future wolverine habitat connectivity conservation using integer linear programming. Conservation prioritization has broad applications across scales, systems, and species. However, the process of preparing, generating, and analyzing the necessary data can be complex. Thus, this protocol details the process from data acquisition to implementation.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00588-8/sref1">Carroll et al.

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The prioritization protocol below describes the specific steps for prioritizing future wolverine connectivity on private land in western Montana. The prioritization methods have broad applications, including single-species, multi-species, and biodiversity questions (<a href="#bib16">Tack et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib15">Scriven et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib3">Delso et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib5">Hanson et al., 2021</a>) and are not limited to terrestrial systems (<a href="#bib14">Pinsky et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib10">Magris et al., 2021</a>). This protocol has resulted in an ongoing collaboration between managers and willing private landowners in Montana, which is unique given historical challenges in science-management-stakeholder partnerships. There are many necessary steps to generate the spatial data layer inputs before prioritizing connectivity (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). While I outline most steps for data preparation here, there is additional information in both <a href="#bib7">Inman et al. (2012)</a> and <a href="#bib1">Carroll et al. (2020)</a>. It is also important to note that the timing of each step is highly dependent on data quantity and quality, study system, study organism(s), availability of ecological datasets, and proficiency with the software. I conducted this work as part of a doctoral dissertation, and thus there was a steep learning curve for many steps; this is reflected in the highly variable timing provided.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 8 years (varies by species abundance, life history, and necessary sample size for questions of interest)</div>
<ol>
<li>Live wildlife captures are typically necessary to place radio-transmitters on individuals for location data. The steps detailed below were collected for previous work and later applied to the prioritization framework (<a href="#bib7">Inman et al., 2012</a>, <a href="#bib6">2013</a>).
<ol type="a">
<li>Develop a framework for wildlife capture and handling based on species behavior and habitat use (e.g., for wolverines, seek animals in high elevation public land in the western United States).</li>
<li>Trap design and animal handling must follow sampling protocols and procedures approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees associated with the researchers’ institution.</li>
<li>These wolverines were captured using box traps during the winters of 2001–2010.</li>
<li>All box traps had trap-transmitters (Telonics, TBT-500, Mesa, AZ) to minimize the time between capture and handling.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Fit individuals with transmitters
<ol type="a">
<li>All individual wolverines were sedated for transmitter implants.</li>
<li>Each of the 38 individuals (23F, 15M) was fitted with an intra-peritoneal very high frequency (VHF) radio transmitter (Advanced Telemetry Systems M1245, M1250, M1255, Isanti, MN; Telonics Imp400L, Imp300L).</li>
<li>Eighteen (11F, 7M) individuals were also fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars (Televilt POSREC 300, Telemetry Solutions, Concord, CA; Lotek Wireless Inc. 3300SL, Newmarket, Ontario, Canada). These collars weighed approximately 300 g and had a drop-off mechanism.</li>
<li>Individual Attribute Collection
<ol type="i">
<li>Identification Number: each animal was given a unique identification number.</li>
<li>Age class: individuals were classified as either juvenile, subadult, or adult.
<ul>
<li>Age was estimated based on the first detection date, whether or not they had descended testes, amount of toothwear, and cementum annuli (<a href="#bib7">Inman et al., 2012</a>).</li>
<li>Juveniles were classified as &lt; 1 year old, subadults as 1–2 years old, and adults as ≥ 3 years old.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sex: individuals were identified as male or female.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Monitoring
<ol type="a">
<li>VHF telemetry points were collected from the air at approximately 10-day intervals (<a href="#bib6">Inman et al., 2013</a>).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For this dataset, 24 individuals were monitored for over 1 year, 12 for over 3 years, and 6 for over 5 years (<a href="#bib7">Inman et al., 2012</a>).</div>

</ol>
</li>
<li>2257 VHF radio telemetry locations were collected for resident individuals across four mountain ranges.</li>
<li>2835 GPS collar locations were collected for resident individuals in the same ranges.</li>
<li>365 additional VHF and GPS locations from 5 individuals were collected from a disparate mountain range.</li>
<li>Data from dispersing individuals (n = 1165 from both VHF and GPS) were kept but not used in subsequent habitat selection models.</li>
<li>Some points were excluded due to post-handling movements or other errors.</li>
<li>Data Issues
<ol type="i">
<li>Approximately 50% of GPS collar locations were not received, likely due to habitat features (<a href="#bib6">Inman et al., 2013</a>).</li>

<li>Collection or acquisition of ecological data
<ol type="a">
<li>Relevant biotic and abiotic spatial data can be collected, acquired from external sources, or leveraged from remotely sensed images as explanatory variables for RSF models (<a href="#bib6">Inman et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib1">Carroll et al., 2020</a>). In both <a href="#bib1">Carroll et al. (2020)</a> and (<a href="#bib2">Carroll et al., 2021</a>), I used pre-existing data layers.
<ol type="i">
<li>I used 2040 to 2069 RCP 8.5 snow water equivalent (SWE) projections at a 5-km resolution to generate future connectivity across international borders (US-Canada) as the single explanatory variable (<a href="#bib2">Carroll et al., 2021</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Logistic regression model (RSF Model)
<ol type="a">
<li>I used logistic regression in R Statistical Software 3.6.5, comparing predictors at “use” locations (n = 5439) to “available” or pseudo-absence points (herein available points; <a href="#bib1">Carroll et al., 2020</a>).
<ol type="i">
<li>Available points were located within a kernel density estimate to ensure that these points were within available habitat (<a href="#bib6">Inman et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib1">Carroll et al., 2020</a>).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> I used the ade4 and adehabitatHR packages – see <a href="http://cran.r-project.org">cran.r-project.org</a> for vignettes.</div>
</li>
<li>Available points were also at least 1 km apart (n = 16,317).</li>
<li>The model was run on 70% of the use/availability data, and the rest was withheld for model validation.</li>

</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Model validation
<ol type="a">
<li>I used a random test dataset of 30% of the use/availability data for model validation.</li>
<li>The model predicted use and availability of withheld data with 78% accuracy (kappa = 32%).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Results
<ol type="a">
<li>Habitat quality was extrapolated from the RSF model output to produce a single raster layer (1-km resolution), representing the relative probability that wolverines could maintain a home range at any given location across the study area (<a href="#bib1">Carroll et al., 2020</a>).
<ol type="i">
<li>The habitat quality was then used to generate resistance layers and core layers (see subsequent section).</li>

<h3 id="sec1.3">Modeling connectivity using Circuitscape 4.0</h3>
<div class="timing">

<ol start="9">
<li>Circuitscape 4.0 (<a href="#bib12">McRae et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib13">McRae and Shah, 2009</a>)
<ol type="a">
<li>Circuitscape is a circuit theory model and represents only one approach to connectivity modeling. Alternative software can be more or less effective for modeling connectivity for different species, and different modeling types have different assumptions, limitations, and caveats (<a href="#bib11">McClure et al., 2016</a>). Special care should be given when selecting software. Additionally, memory limitations and computation limits exist for Circuitscape; see <a href="#bib12">McRae et al. (2008)</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Data Inputs for Circuitscape 4.0: Circuitscape requires inputs of “core” habitat patches and a resistance layer representing its permeability to individuals.
<ol type="a">
<li>Scaled Resistance
<ol type="i">
<li>Using the equation below, I generated a scaled habitat resistance raster from habitat quality, where c = 8 and h = habitat quality matrix (<a href="#bib8">Keeley et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib1">Carroll et al., 2020</a>).

The degree to which the resistance was scaled was based on telemetry location from dispersing individuals in a previous analysis.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Cores, or the sources and destinations for individuals, were selected using a decision threshold at a sensitivity of 0.95 (correct prediction of use) on withheld data (see <a href="#bib1">Carroll et al., 2020</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Modeling Mode
<ol type="a">
<li>There are several modeling mode options in Circuitscape. I chose to use a pairwise analysis, connecting eight neighbors with current map outputs. Decisions on mode options should be based on the information in the Circuitscape User Guide. <a href="#sec5.1">Troubleshooting 1</a>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Connectivity Output(s)
<ol type="a">
<li>Circuitscape can generate different output types, but I selected current map outputs. As mentioned in <a href="#bib1">Carroll et al. (2020)</a>, current maps represent the pathways animals are likely to use and whether or not alternative pathways exist, resulting in current values used in connectivity analyses.</li>

<h3 id="sec2.1">Acquiring input data layers for prioritization</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> minutes to weeks</div>
<p>Several input data layers are needed to solve a systematic conservation planning problem successfully. This step details how I acquired spatial data layers for my wolverine conservation planning problem (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</p>

<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 2. The steps of the prioritization framework needed to generate conservation planning solutions</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol>
<li>Study Area
<ol type="a">
<li>I selected areas with the highest connectivity value (20%) from the previous Circuitscape analysis (<a href="#bib2">Carroll et al., 2021</a>) in western Montana. This boundary defined areas in which I conducted all other analyses. For this analysis, having a smaller study area helped limit the prioritization analysis to the region of highest interest to collaborators and reduced computation time.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ecological Features
<ol type="a">
<li>I included four input features to prioritize in the planning problem: current female presence, core size, human modification, and habitat core centrality. I selected these variables based on evidence in the literature and their importance for dispersal and population growth (<a href="#bib2">Carroll et al., 2021</a>).
<ol type="i">
<li>Of the four input features, three were generated using wolverine camera trap data from <a href="#bib9">Lukacs et al. (2020)</a> and a “core” habitat shapefile generated in <a href="#bib2">Carroll et al. (2021)</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Planning Unit Cost
<ol type="a">
<li>Using Montana cadastral data (<a href="http://www.cdastral.mt.gov">www.cdastral.mt.gov</a>), I generated a parcel-level estimate of easement costs. The cadastral data provided a unique tax-assessed property value for each parcel. Easement values were calculated by taking 50% of property value and adding $5000 (<a href="#bib4">Ferraro, 2003</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Protected Areas
<ol type="a">
<li>I downloaded shapefiles of protected areas from the Protected Areas Database of the US (PAD-US 2.0) at <a href="http://usgs.gov">usgs.gov</a> (<a href="#bib18">U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Gap Analysis Project (GAP), 2018</a>).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> There is a newer version (2.1) of the PAD-US dataset available.</div>
</li>
<li>A spatial layer or column in a spatial layer can be used to identify whether parcels are already “locked-in.” A locked-in parcel can also be referred to as a “fixed” parcel or protected area. I designated conservation easements, state lands, and federal lands as fixed areas.</li>
<li>It should be noted that the activities permitted on protected lands vary greatly, and research goals should determine whether to treat a parcel as fixed or not. I treated all land with any degree of protection as fixed because the goal in this study was to find private land where willing landowners would consider easements.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Spatial analysis is a growing field in ecology that requires understanding how any given feature was generated.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The anticipated outcome of a planning problem is a mappable data layer.

After importing files into ArcGIS (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>), final products can be shared with managers and used for conservation planning. I exported each solution as a Layer File (.lyr) to upload them to DataBasin – see <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>I designed this specific protocol for single-species future connectivity conservation, so alternative applications require modifications.

<p>Circuitscape is not run in R, but instead can be downloaded as an executable file (.exe), run as an ArcGIS toolbox, or coded in Python or Julia (<a href="https://julialang.org/">https://julialang.org/</a>). For this work, I used the ArcGIS toolbox version, which uses drop-down functions. The selected functions are detailed in the protocol.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Step 5: Gurobi installation and activation differ by operating systems.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://prioritizr.net/articles/gurobi_installation.html">https://prioritizr.net/articles/gurobi_installation.html</a> for additional help.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Steop 6: Warning or error messages reading: “there is no package called ‘package name’ ”</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use &gt;install.packages(‘package name’) before calling package with library(). R provides error messages for each error, and solutions are often available within the online R community.</p>
