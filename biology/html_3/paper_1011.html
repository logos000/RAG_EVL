<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol describes the microimplantation of foreign materials such as schistosome eggs, polymer beads, and other microscopic objects into the small and optically transparent larval zebrafish for the assessment of immune responses, including granuloma formation. This protocol has wide applicability for both fundamental studies on host responses to parasite eggs and other foreign bodies, as well as the testing of potential biomaterials and devices used for human medical implants.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00541-4/sref4">Takaki et al.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol is designed to implant foreign bodies into the hindbrain ventricle of zebrafish larvae (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A and 3B). The implantation procedure itself is exceptionally well-tolerated, with no increase in mortality; larvae implanted with either one or two schistosome eggs had a survival rate of 98%–100% at 5 days post-implantation (n = 50 per group), and no discernable detriment to larval health or behavior was observed up to 12 days following implantation of schistosome eggs and polymer beads. With this high baseline of survival, potential effects on mortality and larval health may be observed when implanting new materials, and should be assessed as an experimental parameter.</p>

<p>Following the implantation of a foreign body into the hindbrain ventricle of transgenic zebrafish with fluorescent macrophages, the immune response may be assessed beginning as early as 1 h post-implantation, or the minimal amount of time required to mount and image the larvae after implantation. In the case of an immunogenic foreign body such as the schistosome egg, the initial immune response has been observed as macrophage recruitment. This seeding of macrophages may be observed by high temporal resolution microscopy to visualize and track the migration route of each individual macrophage over a 3-h period following implantation (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C).</p>
<p>Additionally, static imaging with high spatial resolution may be performed at a single time point for quantification of macrophage recruitment, and in the case of a strongly immunogenic foreign body, observation of behaviors such as frustrated phagocytosis and aggregation (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D). Frustrated phagocytosis is observed as the flattening of the macrophage on the surface of the foreign body, and indicates a high affinity between the phagocyte and foreign body (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D). Meanwhile, the macrophages aggregate and form an encasing structure, indicative of the foreign body having a stimulatory affect which induces the macrophages to produce their own chemotactic signals (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D).</p>
<p>After aggregating together, the macrophages may organize into a granuloma which encases the foreign material, a process which has been observed to occur within 3–5 days post-implantation (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>E). To better encase the foreign material, these granuloma macrophages may become tightly interdigitated in a process known as epithelioid transformation, which can be confirmed by immunofluorescence detection of E-cadherin, a marker for epithelioid transformation (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>F) (<a href="#bib1">Cronan et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib2">Pagan and Ramakrishnan, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib4">Takaki et al., 2021a</a>)</p>
<p>While this example is limited to the macrophage immune response to the schistosome egg, this protocol has been used with transgenic zebrafish expressing fluorescently labeled neutrophils to observe the neutrophil response, and has likewise been adapted to assess the immune response to a variety of implanted materials, include polymer beads (<a href="#bib4">Takaki et al., 2021a</a>).</p>
<p>Additional granuloma-inducing foreign materials which may be implanted include other species of schistosome eggs (e.g., <i>S. japonicum</i> and <i>S. haematobium</i>), pine pollen (which induces epithelioid granulomas), and silica. The immune response to specific antigens maybe be tested by implanting polymer beads which have been conjugated with various proteins and molecules of interest.</p>
<p>While the normally acellular hindbrain ventricle is ideal for assessing immune cell recruitment and response to foreign bodies following implantation, this protocol may be modified for implantation into other anatomical regions of the zebrafish. Implantation into the avascular region of the yolk sac may be used to assess angiogenesis (<a href="#bib3">Rodríguez et al., 2012</a>). Implantation into the brain may be used to directly observe the interaction of neurons with physical materials and devices in the study of brain machine interfaces.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Although this protocol is written in step-by-step detail, implantation is a surgical procedure performed at the micrometer level, and as such, success is entirely dependent on the skill of the operator. In particular, a steady hand, fine motor skills, and hand-eye coordination are required traits of the operator.</p>
<p>When applying this protocol to new materials, size of the foreign material is an important consideration. Implanted materials must be large enough to induce foreign body reaction rather than phagocytosis, and large enough to observe cell-to-cell interactions on its surface, yet not so large that they exceed the capacity of the hindbrain ventricle. Based on these conditions, the minimum and maximum size of an object would be within the range of 10 μm–80 μm in diameter, with each extreme end of the range sufficient, but not ideal. The ideal size for an object is approximately 50 μm diameter. Another consideration is durability of the implanted material. Implanted materials must be durable enough to remain intact during the procedure. For example, self-made agarose microspheres below 1% were found to be too soft for implantation, a problem which could be solved by increasing the agarose percentage, or by cross-linking the agarose to improve durability.</p>
<p>Implantation is easiest within 30–48 h post-fertilization while larvae are soft. However, during this time the larvae possess innate-only immunity as conferred by macrophages and neutrophils. To study other immune cells, one possibility is to raise the implanted larvae until later timepoints when innate and adaptive immunity have fully developed. Alternatively, it may be possible to perform microimplantation in older larvae.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The entire larva was aspirated into the VAMP during usage (step 2a).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To avoid aspirating the larva during implantation, do not use excessive thumb pressure when grasping with the VAMP; gentle occlusion of the hole should result in gentle grasping of the larva. If difficulty persists, then the VAMP pressure may be too high, and may need adjustment. To reduce the aspiration pressure, small perforations and tissue paper maybe introduced to the tubing between the filter and the pump. If more precise adjustments are needed, a small airline control valve may be inserted between the filter and the pump.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>There is no suction from the VAMP (step 2a).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The filter may have become wet. Replace the filter and ensure that water is not aspirated into the hosing during usage. Ensure that hosing is secure.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Incisions are difficult to make, and the hindbrain ventricle is difficult to target (step 2b).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>As the larval zebrafish matures, its tegument becomes tougher, and the hindbrain ventricle becomes narrower and more elongated. Implantation should be performed within the optimal age-range, between 30–48 hpf, while the tegument is soft, and the hindbrain ventricle is a large target for implantation. If the problem persists, ensure that the CAIN is beveled to a fine point.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>There is poor suction from the CAIN (step 2d).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The CAIN might be clogged or contain an air bubble. Attach a p1000 tip to the CAIN hosing and gently aspirate and expel the fish water from the tip to remove any clogs or air bubbles.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Survival is poor following microimplantation (step 2a).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The equipment may be contaminated. Disinfect the depression slide with 70% ethanol. Disinfect the tip of the VAMP by spraying or pipetting 500 μL into the thumb port, and then drain by touching the tip to a lab tissue. Allow to dry before usage. Ensure that equipment is clean and free of any pathogens which are not being studied.</p>
