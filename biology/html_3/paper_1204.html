<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A key observation of tissue injury, such as stroke and burn, is a state of systemic immunosuppression characterized by loss of T cells and rise of infections. Here, we present an <i>in vitro</i> model for cell-cell interactions between innate (macrophages) and adaptive (T cells) immune cells. This protocol facilitates bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and splenic T cells in a coculture model. The procedure mimics injury-induced T cell death, which is driven by inflammasome activation in macrophages.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00689-4/sref8">Roth et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<li>Femur and tibia collection.
<ol type="a">
<li>Euthanize BL6/J mouse, disinfect and fixate in supine position.</li>
<li>Carefully expose femur and tibia from surrounding muscles and tissue (a detailed protocol can be found in <a href="#bib9">Toda et al., (2020)</a>).</li>
<li>Store prepared bones in 10 mL of ice-cold PBS for transfer to laminar air flow.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Collection and straining of bone marrow-derived cells.
<ol type="a">
<li>Prepare 50 mL conic tube and 40 μm strainer (one per mouse).</li>
<li>Remove the epiphyses from femurs &amp; tibias.</li>
<li>Flush out the bone marrow from femurs and tibiae onto the 40 μm strainer.
<ol type="i">
<li>Use a 23 G needle on a 1 mL syringe (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>) filled with sterile PBS, position the needle in the bone shaft and carefully flush until bone marrow is mobilized. Repeat procedure until all bone marrow is on the strainer.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use syringe plunger and additional 10 mL PBS to flush the remaining cells through the strainer into the conic tube. Afterward fill up volume with PBS to 20 mL.</li>
<li>Wash cells by centrifuging the tube at 500 <i>g</i> for 8 min at room temperature (RT; 20°C–25°C).</li>
<li>Resuspend in 20 mL PBS and wash again (500 <i>g</i> for 8 min).</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Stroke and other sterile tissue injuries induce a state of systemic immunosuppression. A key characteristic is the induction of lymphopenia, the reduction of lymphocyte counts cells in blood, lymph nodes and spleen (<a href="#bib7">Offner et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#bib3">Liesz et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib6">Meisel et al., 2005</a>). We have previously identified that the interaction of innate immune cells (monocytes) with lymphocytes is the critical step in mediating lymphocyte loss after tissue injury (<a href="#bib8">Roth et al., 2021</a>). The <i>in vitro</i> model presented here, enables to study the details of this cell–cell interaction.</p>
<p>For bone marrow cell isolation from one mouse (2 femurs and tibiae), expected yield is approximately 6–10 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells. Healthy cells will be seen as clear, roundish cells in suspension after the cell isolation. Within the first 2–3 days whole spectrum of bone marrow-derived cells, such as erythrocytes and neutrophils, can still be found in the culture. The proliferation and differentiation process of BMDMs, driven by rM-CSF or L929-conditioned medium (L929 murine fibroblasts), provides adherent, mononuclear cells. Erythrocytes and other bone marrow-derived cells disappear. Macrophages will ramify from day 3–4 on and provide a confluent layer of macrophages by day 7 (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A).</p>
<p>For isolation of splenic T cells using a commercially available enrichment kit (see <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a>), expected yield per murine spleen is approximately 3–5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells. Seeding the enriched T cells in anti-CD3e coated 96-well U bottom wells and the addition of anti-CD28, provides active, vital T cells overnight (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B).</p>
<p>The activation of BMDMs with an inflammasome stimulus after priming with LPS leads to cleavage of caspase-1, the effector enzyme of the inflammasome (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>C and 2D). Inflammasome activation leads to the release of IL-1β, activating other myeloid cells to express cell death receptor ligands, such as Fas Ligand (FasL; <a href="#bib5">Martin and Wesche, 2002</a>). Activated T cells express the death receptor Fas on their surface (<a href="#bib11">Yamada et al., 2017</a>). In this context, cell–cell interaction is essential for T cell loss (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). The loss of T cells can be identified by time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a>). The advantage of the microscopic approach is to identify the starting point of T cell loss. In the above explained setup, a decrease of GFP+ T cells can be observed (treated with murine stroke serum) already 60 min after starting the cell–cell interaction phase (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). The advantages of flow cytometry are the possibility to acquire absolute cell numbers and the expression of death receptor ligands. In the coculture setup (used ratio Macrophages/T cells: <b>1:2</b>), treatment with murine stroke serum shows a decrease of T cells compared to macrophages (CD11b+ / CD11b- percentages; <a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>A and 5B). The percentage of differentiated macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+MHCII+) did not vary between treatment groups (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). The expression of FasL on macrophages was strongly increased after treatment with murine stroke serum compared to sham serum treated coculture (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D).</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Microscopy based analysis</h3>
<p>During the cell–cell interaction phase (in this approach 180 min) we acquired microphotographs of determined fields of views from every well of the triplicates. Single channel (GFP) acquisition was sufficient to analyze T cell numbers. The next step was thresholding (setting the range for true-positive fluorescence) and binarizing the photographs in ImageJ. This enables to use the “analyze particles” function of the software. Based on magnification and resolution of the images, particle size and sphericity values are set. Finally, quantification of the binarized images lead to a single cell number value per FOV, which then was used for further statistical analysis.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Flow cytometric analysis</h3>
<p>For the last 10 min of the cell–cell interaction phase, the 96-well plates are placed under the laminar air flow at room temperature. Cells were carefully harvested by cell scraping and collected in HBSS. Cells are then stained with the according flow cytometry antibodies (see <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a>). After the wash step cells are brought to the same volume and acquired with a multicolor flow cytometer with volumetric measurement. We collected 10,000 CD45+ cells per sample which enabled us to calculate back to the total cell amount per well. To determine the two cell types from the well (macrophages and T cells) we gated for CD45+CD11b+F4/80+MHCII+ macrophages and CD45+CD11b-CD3+CD4<sup>+/−</sup> T cells (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>A–5C). The ability of macrophages to induce T cell apoptosis was quantified by the amount of FasL-expressing (CD178+) macrophages (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The coculture model mimics the complex interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells after a sterile tissue injury. Although the model provides high reproducibility, it brings along a number of limitations.</p>
<p>The number of cells and cell types is limited, unlike in the <i>in vivo</i> models. As the coculture facilitates the pool of splenic CD3+ T cells and to rM-CSF differentiated bone marrow-derived macrophages, the variety of cells is of course restricted in comparison to a diverse systemic pool of immune cells which egress and migrate during local and systemic inflammation. While this model enables to observe the interaction between two different cell populations, additional remote interactions with other cell populations and the complex immunological environment via cytokines and chemokines cannot be modeled. Also immunological effects on remote organs or the important aspect of secondary infections cannot be investigated with this model.</p>
<p>This coculture is optimized for monocytic inflammasome activation which subsequently leads to T cell death – the predominant way of T cell death after sterile tissue injury (<a href="#bib8">Roth et al., 2021</a>). However, the role of specific (murine) T cell-expressed inflammasome sensors, such as CARD8 (<a href="#bib4">Linder et al., 2020</a>), need a different experimental design.</p>
<p>The mentioned approaches to quantify T cell death in coculture – microscopy and flow cytometry – also include limitations: Time lapse microscopy allows a fast and repetitive readout. However, further cellular information can only be acquired by fixation and additional staining of potentially interesting target proteins. Flow cytometry can provide a multitude of additional information dependent on the used antibodies. However, only one time point per sample can be analyzed, due to the process of collection and staining of cells. Moreover, a lengthy or faulty procedure of staining living cells can affect the survival of cells and by that, affect the experimental outcome.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Only a little number of cells can be found after culturing bone marrow-derived cells for BMDM differentiation (steps 1–4 in “<a href="#sec3.1">generation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure a pellet can be seen after every washing step during the bone marrow cell collection. After titrating cells for seeding, check cell densities on the dishes. Careful expose and extract femur and tibia and do not damage the bones. Detailed information can also be found in <a href="#bib9">Toda et al., (2020)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Inflammasome activation is not sufficient with donor serum (steps 10–14 in “<a href="#sec3.4">coculture procedure</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure the serum donor mice had a sufficiently severe tissue injury. Only minor lesions such as small, cortical brain injuries do not lead to sufficient release of inflammasome-activating molecules in the serum. Concentrations of potential inflammasome activators in the serum, like dsDNA, can be acquired beforehand. For excluding problems with the BMDMs, the use of positive control for inflammasome activation (e.g., 10 μM Nigericin) can be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Cell culture shows bacterial contamination (“moving particles” under the microscope) (steps 5 and 6 in “<a href="#sec3.2">harvest and seeding of BMDMs in 96-well plates</a>” and steps 7–9 in “<a href="#sec3.3">T cell isolation from murine spleen</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Be aware that all tools are sterilized and stored in ethanol. Soak the mice skin with ethanol when collecting bones and spleen for cell culture to avoid contaminations. All operations have to be conducted under a laminar air flow hood. Check the status of the cells every day. Once potentially contamination of bacteria, fungi, or recombinant protein is found, discard the cells and appropriately autoclave all cell culture dishes and media.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Only a small amount of BMDMs can be detected after the coculture approach (steps 10–14 in “<a href="#sec3.4">Coculture procedure</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Two aspects need to be taken under consideration: 1. Activation of the cells (LPS priming and later stimulation) lead to morphological changes of the macrophages and potential loss of adherence. 2. (Over) activation of the inflammasome can lead to pyroptotic cell death of the macrophages. When establishing a new stimulus, perform a titration experiment to determine the least necessary stimulus concentration in order to avoid cell toxicity.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Cells and/or whole well content clots after adding the murine serum (see “<a href="#sec2.1">murine stroke serum collection and storage</a>” in “<a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>”.)</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The initial preparation of the serum was unsuccessful. Check during preparation, if the blood is clotted after the 30 min incubation step at room temperature. If blood is not fully clotted add another 10 min of incubation at room temperature.</p>

<p class="table-legend">Data was analyzed using ImageJ software. Microphotographs (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>) from the coculture kinetics were thresholded for GFP+ cells. Thresholded cells were then quantified using “analyze particles” task. All acquired numbers of GFP+ cells were normalized to the according “0:00” cell numbers and plotted in a graph (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Abbreviations: UT = untreated</p>
