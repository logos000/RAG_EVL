<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Release of neurotransmitters by synaptic vesicle exocytosis at presynaptic terminals is critical for neuronal communication within the nervous system. Electrophysiology and electron microscopy are powerful and complementary approaches used to evaluate the function of synaptic proteins in synaptic transmission. Here, we provide a protocol detailing the use of these two approaches at <i>C. elegans</i> neuromuscular junctions, including steps for worm picking and dissection, <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological recording, and sample preparation for electron microscopy, followed by imaging and analysis.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib6">Liu et al. (2021)</a> and <a href="#bib4">Li et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> around 3 h</div>
<ol>
<li>Before the day of recording, the following needs to be prepared:
<ol type="a">
<li>Pick 20–30 L4 stage well-fed worms to a new NGM plate (nematode growth medium, please refer to <a href="http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strainmaintain/strainmaintain.html">http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_strainmaintain/strainmaintain.html</a>). These worms will be used for recordings in the next day.</li>
<li>Internal pipette stock solution. It is recommended to make a 200 mL or 500 mL internal solution that can be aliquoted in 1.8 mL Eppendorf tubes, stored at −80°C and used for at least a year. The original pH value of the internal solution is around 3.5. Use CsOH to adjust the pH value to 7.2 prior to freezing.</li>
<li>Collagenase digestion solution. First make 500 mL extracellular solution and bubble the solution with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% O<sub>2</sub> for at least 20 min. Dissolve 0.5 g collagenase powder into the extracellular solution to make a 1 mg/mL stock solution. Disperse into 1.8 mL eppendorf tubes, store at −80°C freezer. This can be used for at least two years.</li>
<li>Prepare Sylgard 184 coated circular coverslips and cure over night at 60°C.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>On the day of recording, the following needs to be prepared in advance:
<ol type="a">
<li>Make 500 mL fresh extracellular solution and bubble the solution with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% O<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>Prepare the ice bottle. Put three cell culture bottles filled with water into an ice box for at least 20 min. These bottles will be used to immobilize worms.</li>
<li>Pull all required pipettes, including recording pipettes which need to be polished, the stimulus pipettes (polish is not necessary), and the cutting pipettes which have sharp ends.</li>
<li>Thaw a tube of collagenase and internal pipette solution.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Electron microscopy</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> around 2 h</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Before the day of high pressure freezing, the following should be done:
<ol type="a">
<li>Set out 3–7 NGM plates, previously seeded with <i>E.coli</i>, at RT (room temperature; 22°C) 2–3 days prior to day of freezing. This allows the bacteria to thicken, as these bacteria will be used as a cryoprotectant when freezing the worms.</li>
<li>Day before the freeze pick 40–60 L4 stage, well-fed worms per strain being frozen to new plates.</li>
<li>Prepare and sequentially number cryotubes for each strain being frozen (prepare extra) by putting 4 holes spaced around the center of the tube, as well as 2 holes in the lid. The holes allow for liquid nitrogen to enter the tube when submerged.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The freeze and substitution processes require a large amount of liquid nitrogen. A tank should be ordered or secured prior to freezing and substitution.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>On the day of freezing:
<ol type="a">
<li>Use a weighing spatula to scrape the bacteria to be used as the cryoprotectant into mounds on the surface of the plates. This will be used for picking worms and for filling the specimen carriers.</li>

<h4 id="sec3.1.1">Washing and immobilizing adult worm</h4>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 min</div>
<ol>
<li>Pick one adult worm from the NGM plate and place it into a small container (the cap of a 1.8 mL eppendorf tube is recommended) containing a small amount of bath solution. Use a tip-broken glass pipette (the open size is ∼0.3 mm) to suck the worm into the pipette and then gently blow it out. Repeat this for 3–5 times to wash away the bacterial on the worm body (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>A and 1B).
<figure id="fig1"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/929-Fig1.jpg" alt="Fig1.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Washing and immobilizing worm for dissection</div>
<p>(A and B) Pick 1 adult worm from the plate to a bath container for cleaning. (C) The cleaned worm is immersed in a drop of bath solution on a sylgard pad. (D) Immobile the worm on a cold cell culture bottle.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Suck the worm into the washing pipette and transfer the worm onto a Sylgard 184 coated circular coverslip. Make sure the worm is immersed in a small drop of bath solution (∼20 μL). This prevents the worm from desiccating (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C).</li>
<li>Place the coverslip onto the cell culture bottle filled with cold water. The low temperature immobilizes the worm quickly (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="sec3.1.2">Applying glue and dissecting worm</h4>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 min</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Once the worm is immobilized, remove extra solution using a micropipette connected by thin tubing to an Eppendorf pipette tip to allow mouth-controlled suction. Use the same pipette to adjust the worm body to an arc shape (the dorsal side is on the outer curve and the ventral side on the inner curve). A tip-broken pipette with a small amount of glue at the end is used to touch the dorsal side of the worm gently and quickly. The glue then automatically spreads along the worm body. Repeat this for several times at different spots on the dorsal side to solidify the connection between the worm and the glue (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A). A 15–20 μL bath solution is then quickly added back onto the worm.

</figure>
</li>
<li>Use another pipette with a very sharp tip (called a cutting pipette) to cut the cuticle from a point a little behind vulva to the bulb along the dorsal side (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B). After dissection, an extraction pipette (about 5–10 μm of the open size) controlled by mouth suction via thin tubing is used to remove all the internal organs, including the intestine, gonads, and eggs. The cut-edge of the cuticle on the ventral side is glued down with a new pipette to expose the ventral nerve cord and the body wall muscles. During gluing positive pressure is applied to the pipette to prevent the solution entering the glue tip and polymerizing the glue before it has been dispensed (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C).</li>
<li>Take the coverslip off the ice bottle and secure it into the inner well of the recording chamber with pre-applied silicone grease. Using the cap of a 15 mL centrifuge tube to apply gentle pressure to the coverslip and ensure that the seal between the coverslip and the chamber is good.</li>
<li>Add a 20 μL collagenase (1 mg/mL dissolved in extracellular solution) to the small drop of solution on the worm to digest the cells for 30 s (the final concentration of the collagenase applied to the cells is therefore about 0.5 mg/mL). The collagenase tube should be kept on ice at all times.</li>
<li>Transfer the chamber to the inner holder of the moving stage and adjust this to the correct position from which both the stimulus and patch pipettes can reach the neuromuscular junctions easily. Wash several times with the bath solution via the perfusion system to remove the collagenase completely. Finally add 1.5–2 mL bath solution into the chamber. The preparation is now ready for recording.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> It is important to leave a very small volume of bath solution under the worm before the first glue application. This prevents the glue crossing to the ventral side.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This dissection step is the most important because the quality of the dissection directly determines the ability to obtain good data. Damage to the cell usually comes from shaking of the cutting pipette. We hold the pipette (about 1 cm from the sharp tip) between the thumb and index finger and place the hand with the pipette onto the iced bottle tightly before the cuticle incision. This allows us to hold the pipette in position without shaking, thereby avoiding unnecessary damage in the dissection process. Usually, this step requires a few weeks or months of practice, although it takes even longer to master the dissection of smaller worms.</div>

<ol start="9">
<li>Position the recording chamber on the moving stage. This allows both the recording pipette and the stimulus pipette (or the pressure-ejection pipette) to be placed on proper position. Patch the muscle using the standard patch-clamping technique. The patch pipette (4–5 megohm resistance) is pressed gently against the muscle cell (at the mid-point) and suction is applied to form a high resistance seal (gigaohm seal). Changing the holding potential to −60 mV and applying brief mouth suction ruptures the patch, thereby forming the whole-cell patch.</li>
<li>Once the whole-cell patch clamp is formed, miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) are observed at the −60 mV membrane potential (the reversal potential of GABA receptor channels) (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A and 3B). Switch the membrane potential to 0 mV (the reversal potential of acetylcholine receptor channels) to record miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A and 3B).

</li>
<li>To record electrical stimulus-evoked EPSCs, a second pipette (4–5 megohm resistance, filled with bath solution) is placed above the ventral nerve cord (one muscle anterior distance from the recording pipette). Press the stimulus pipette gently onto the cord and apply a 0.4 ms, 85 uA square pulse to depolarize the neurons (Stimulator: WPI A365), which will produce a large and synchronized evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (evoked EPSC) (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A and 3B). A typical wild-type evoked EPSC is around 1.5–2.5 nA in amplitude.</li>
<li>For estimating the readily releasable pool size, place a pipette containing 1 M sucrose solution at the end of the patched muscle cell (around half muscle distance from the recording pipette), and a 20 psi, 2 s pressure pulse was applied by Picospritzer (Parker) to create a rapid jump in osmolarity at the neuromuscular junctions (&lt; 200 msec latency on average) (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>C and 3D).</li>
<li>To measure the function of receptors on the muscle membrane, apply drugs (e.g., acetylcholine, GABA, and levamisole, dissolved in bath solution) by pressure-ejection them directly onto the body of the muscle. The pipette filled with drug is placed at the end of the patched muscle cell. Pressure-ejection parameters are kept the same for these drugs (12 Psi, 100 ms) (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>C and 3D).</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> It is important to place the stimulus pipette in the correct position (usually one muscle distance from the recording pipette) as the evoked current will be small if it is too far away or the gigaohm seal will be damaged if it is too close.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is recommended to record all types of synaptic currents from the same muscle, and only one muscle is recorded in each dissected worm.

<p>The Igor (WaveMetrics) software is used to analyze all electrophysiology data.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Analyze the minis using an Igor macro called “Amperometric Spike Analysis” originally written by Dr. Eugene Mosharow from Columbia University. The software “Mini Analysis” is also recommended. A proper threshold needs to be set before running the macro. In most cases, a 4 pA minimum threshold is used, above which the majority of the mini events are accurately selected and analyzed (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>) (<a href="#bib2">Li et al., 2018</a>). An averaged mEPSC current is integrated in Igor to calculate the charge transfer (the pink area, <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).

</li>
<li>For sucrose-evoked currents, the integrated charge transfer is computed as a function of time for the entire sucrose response (the pink area in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>), and the charge accumulation is corrected for the baseline holding current and spontaneous fusion events prior to sucrose application.

<li>Replace the trimming/sectioning knife holder stage with the chuck holder stage on the ultramicrotome.</li>
<li>Place the worm block into the chuck and firmly tighten, being careful to ensure the block is secure but do not tighten to the point of cracking the block. Place the chuck into the chuck holder and tighten to secure the chuck.</li>
<li>Using a fresh razor blade, angled ∼45°, trim away excess resin from the block underneath the embedded worm using a downward motion. Take care to avoid cutting too close to the worm to prevent damage. This initial rough trim will eliminate wear of the trim tool as well as reduce the time spent on achieving the trapezoid face shape needed to create a ribbon when sectioning.</li>
<li>Remove the chuck from the stage and place it into the specimen holder on the ultramicrotome.</li>
<li>Adjust the angle of the block so that the area of interest of the worm will be perpendicular to the sectioning knife.</li>
<li>Rotate the chuck to 90° and trim the bottom and top of the block with the edge of the trim tool.</li>
<li>Trim the face using the top of the trim tool.</li>
<li>Rotate the chuck back to 0° and return the angle of the chuck to 0°.</li>
<li>Move the stage to the angle that corresponds with the angle used to trim the bottom, top and face of the block.</li>
<li>Rotate the chuck 5° to the left and trim the left side of the block using the right edge of the trim tool.</li>
<li>Rotate the chuck 5° to the right and trim the right side of the block using the left edge of the trim tool.</li>
<li>Repeat these trim steps until the block is a trapezoid shape with the top and bottom flush with the worm. The block should be wide enough to allow for the width of ∼1½ - 2 worm diameters on either side of the sample. The block face should be angled perpendicular to the area of interest. Example: To examine the ventral nerve cord anterior to the vulva trim away 250 μm from the tip of the nose in 1 μm steps to reach the area of interest for collecting sections, ensuring the angle of the face of the block is exactly flush with the angle of the worm at the area of interest.</li>
<li>After reaching the area of interest and achieving the trapezoid face shape be sure the face of the block is free of any imperfections or debris. The face should be shiny and reflective. If the face is not perfect trim off a couple more sections until it is shiny.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Diamond knives are easily damaged and expensive to sharpen so this step requires prior training and practice.</div>
</li>
<li>Turn off the top light and use the reflection of the knife on the block face to align the knife to the exact angle of the block. Use 0.3–0.5 μm steps to check the distance of the knife from the left and right sides of the block face, and the top then bottom and make small adjustments to the block angle to match top and bottom distances and change the angle of the knife to make left/right adjustments until it takes the same number of steps on both sides to reach the block face. You can determine this by monitoring the reflection of the knife on the face of the block, when the reflection goes black, the knife is near the block face.</li>
<li>When the block and knife are perfectly aligned, step the block back slightly and set the automated cutting parameters on the ultramicrotome using the reflection on the bottom of the block as the starting point and on the top as the end point.</li>
<li>Orient the specimen arm so that the block is below the knife to start. Turn the top light on again.</li>
<li>Slightly overfill the boat with ddH<sub>2</sub>O so that a dome of water is just above the boat and water is covering the blade.</li>
<li>Allow the blade to soak up water for between 10–15 min.</li>
<li>When the blade is wet and with the block still positioned below the knife, adjust the water level until the water surface is reflective, appears silver and is level with the edge of the knife blade.</li>
<li>Raise the block to be slightly above the knife blade.</li>
<li>Start the automated movement of the ultramicrotome specimen arm. If the alignment is accurate a ribbon of sections should form. If a ribbon does not begin to form, remove water from the boat and repeat alignment steps.</li>
<li>Stop the automated movement after ∼25–30 sections and using an eye lash brush gently move the ribbon of sections away from the blade.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The quality of the electrophysiology data is directly determined by the quality of the preparation. A good dissection allows to acquire high quality of mEPSC, mIPSC, and evoked EPSC (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) (<a href="#bib3">Li et al., 2019</a>), or sucrose- or drug-activated currents (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) (<a href="#bib4">Li et al., 2021</a>). For wild-type worms, the mEPSC and mIPSC frequencies vary from 20 Hz–80 Hz, with an average of around 45 Hz. The amplitudes of the evoked EPSCs vary from 1.5 nA–3 nA, with an average of around 2 nA. Please note that all recordings are performed at room temperature (22°C). For temperature sensitive experiments, a temperature control chamber should be used.</p>
<p>The quality of electron micrographs and subsequent data analyses is dependent on the quality of the freeze and substitution process. A successful preparation should yield dark worms that have retained their shape and ultrastructural morphology (<a href="#fig9">Figures 9</a> and <a href="#fig10">10</a>). Though the protocol (described in steps 37–38 and shown in <a href="#fig9">Figures 9</a> and <a href="#fig10">10</a>) was utilized for the ultrastructural analysis of neuromuscular synapses, the preparation allows for the analysis of any regions of interest, step 38 (shown in <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>) merely provides an example of the type of analyses conducted in the original referenced study.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>All data were statistically analyzed in Prism 9 software. Normality distribution of the data was determined by the D'Agostino-Pearson normality test. When the data followed a normal distribution, an unpaired student’s t-test (two-tailed) or one-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the statistical significance. In other cases, a Mann-Whitney test or one-way ANOVA following Kruskal-Wallis test was used. All electrophysiology and EM data are presented as mean ± SEM (∗ p&lt;0.05, ∗∗ p&lt;0.01, ∗∗∗p&lt;0.001).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The electric stimulus-evoked IPSC cannot be obtained using the current protocol. One possibility is that the processes for the GABAergic motor neurons are relatively shorter than the cholinergic motor neurons. The gigaohm seal is damaged by the stimulus pipette if it is too close to the patch pipette.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>It is difficult to cut the cuticle, and the worm separates from the glue during the dissection (step 5).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is recommended to make 10–15 holes along the dorsal cord by penetrate the sharp end of the cutting pipette into the cuticle. This takes longer time but makes the cutting easier.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>It is hard to form the gigaohm seal (step 9).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First check the osmolarity of both the internal (∼315 osm) and external solution (∼330 osm). The difference between these two solutions is key for gigaohm seal. Next consider using a new stock of collagenase.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Precipitate formation on grids when staining (step 36).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Precipitate can form on grids when post-staining with Lead Citrate. Make sure the Lead Citrate solution and ddH<sub>2</sub>O are CO<sub>2</sub>-free. It is important to keep from breathing on the samples while staining. Be sure to keep the grids covered when possible throughout staining and washes.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Poor sample and/or image quality (step 37).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Image quality may be poor if the worm sample or sections are damaged. Damage may be due to a poor freeze or substitution process. Quality of the freeze may vary among and between strains. Check another worm from the same strain, if quality of a second worm is poor check a worm from another strain. In some rare cases a freeze and substation process will need to be repeated.</p>
