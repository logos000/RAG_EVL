<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Robust patient-derived platforms that recapitulate the cellular and molecular fingerprints of glioblastoma are crucial for developing effective therapies. Here, we describe a chemically defined protocol for 3D culture and propagation of glioblastoma in 3D gliospheres, patient-derived organoids (PDOs), mouse brain orthotopic xenografts (PDOXs), and downstream drug and immunofluorescence assays. This simple-to-follow protocol allows assessing drug sensitivity, on-target activity, and combined drug synergy. Promising therapies can then be validated in PDOXs for translation in precision medicine oncology trials.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib1">Chadwick et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="#bib5">Patrizii et al. (2018)</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Patient-derived tissues, including glioblastoma (GBM) material and corresponding blood samples, must be obtained under an approved Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol. Please consult with your local institutional authority board for IRB guidelines regarding the use of human specimens and biological samples.</li>
<li>All personnel involved in the studies must acquire the required training and be certified to meet their local institute’s requirements for working with human subject materials. Tissue culture procedures must be completed under an appropriate Biosafety Level containment (e.g., BL2) as determined by local Biosafety Review Board for use of human tissues and viral vectors used in xenografts studies. All animal xenograft studies must be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</li>
<li>GBMs are typically diagnosed clinically using MRI and histopathology according to WHO criteria (see <a href="#bib6">Weller et al., 2015</a>).</li>
<li>On the same day, prior to receiving the surgical specimen, reconstitute all of the components of the tissue culture media from stock growth factors reconstituted per the manufacturer’s instructions into working media and stored accordingly (see reagents within the <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a> below).</li>
<li>Thaw Matrigel or another extracellular matrix (ECM) basement membrane material in 4°C overnight (8–12 h) and per the manufacturer’s instructions.</li>
<li>When culturing organoids, put the desired number of cell culture plates in the 37°C incubator for 1–2 h prior to starting the organoid culture.</li>
<li>All cell cultures must be performed using sterile/aseptic practices and under standard culture conditions (37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Prolonged organoid cultures may be transferred to bioreactors under similar conditions after 2 weeks of initiating the 3D plate cultures.</li>
<li>If xenograft studies are planned, prepare lentiviral reporters (optional to allow performing live imaging of mouse xenografts) from frozen stock and generate fresh suspensions of 3D cultures to be labeled with lentiviral reporters for engraftment in the mouse brain and generation of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models.</li>
<li>Age and sex matched NSG mice or alternatively other immunodeficient mice (3–4 mice that are 6–12 weeks old per patient-derived sample) are made available prior to starting the PDOX experiment. The sex of the mouse should be matched to the sex of the patient from which the tissue sample has been derived, in order to account for a male to female ratio of 1.6:1 of GBM incidence. Our results were generated using NSG (NOD.Cg-<i>Prkdc</i><sup>scid</sup> <i>Il2rg</i><sup>tm1Wjl</sup>/SzJ) mice obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.</li>

<li>Surgical specimen should be collected from the operation room within 60 min of tumor removal from GBM patients previously diagnosed using MRI and/or histology and undergoing craniotomy resection. The neuropathologist will place the GBM specimen in serum-free GBM collection medium after diagnostic confirmation of GBM using H&amp;E staining. Pathology assistant will record the deidentified sample number and have it delivered to the tissue culture facility.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Tissue samples are divided into three fractions: first for cryofreezing, DNA and RNA extraction (for glioseq exome sequencing; <a href="#bib4">Nikiforova et al., 2016</a>), second for expression profiling to determine GBM subtypes and targets for drug testing, and third for live tissue for initiating 3D cultures to make gliospheres and PDOs.
<ol type="a">
<li>Under the tissue culture hood, place the tissue in a Petri dish and use a sterile scalpel to cut patient GBM tissue into small cubic fragments (~1 mm<sup>3</sup> each).</li>
<li>Incubate tissue fragments with Accutase at 10 mL per 75 cm<sup>2</sup> surface area for 2–4 min at 37°C only when tissue fragments are ≥1 mm<sup>3</sup> in size. This will dissociate tumor cells from the surrounding extracellular matrix. If fragments are smaller in size, use only 1–2 mL of Accutase in a 15 mL Falcon tube and incubate for 2 min at 37°C.</li>
<li>Collect fragments from the incubator and pass multiple times through a 26-gauge needle to obtain a suspension of single cells. Serial passing through the needle helps break down tissue fragments and generate tumor cell suspension.</li>
<li>Filter the cell suspension through a 40 μm filter placed on top of a 50 mL Falcon tube. Wash the filter with 5 mL of serum-free GBM media into the 50 mL tube.</li>

</li>
<li>Remove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL of GSBM.</li>
<li>Using a 200 μL pipette, mechanically dissociate the pellet into a single cell suspension by pipetting up and down gently multiple times.

<li>Incubate at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>Change half of the media every 2 days by tilting the plate to a 45°angle.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> It is easy to aspirate the spheres/organoids when removing fluids (i.e., media, PBS, fixative) from the wells, therefore, it is critical to monitor the cells during the aspiration.</div>

<li>For drug testing in GBM PDOs (see below), IF and/or IHC are done with primary antibodies against GBM hallmark GFAP, glioma stem cell (GSC) proteins such as the orphan nuclear receptor tailless (TLX), the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and self-renewal protein SOX2, and the self-renewal marker BMI1, and against pathway specific markers such as PI3K/mTOR marker pS6 to detect drug on-target activities and validate combination therapies (See (<a href="#bib2">Mehta et al., 2015</a>) and (<a href="#bib1">Chadwick et al., 2020</a>) for details).

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>GBM 3D gliosphere and PDO culture can be performed in 4D printed cell culture arrays to expedite the processing (<a href="#bib1">Chadwick et al., 2020</a>) or alternatively in the traditional ultra-low attachment plates described in this protocol. Gliospheres are enriched for GSCs and therefore could be used to study GBM GSCs, while PDOs contain GSCs and differentiated cells and used for drug sensitivity testing (<a href="#bib1">Chadwick et al., 2020</a>). One to 2 days after seeding, 3D cultured cells should self-assemble to make the sphere-shaped structures in gliospheres. As the gliosphere proceeds, cells will actively proliferate and appear denser, until individual cells can no longer be resolved under low magnification of the microscope (typically day 7 for gliospheres). For PDOs, cells will move slower within the outer edge of the Matrigel droplet and start projecting extensions between multiple cell groups. PDOs become darker and denser starting at day 14, and density and interconnections continue to increase with time. Using the described protocol, we could generate long-term 3D cultures of gliospheres and PDOs for many passages during the period of 3 months of continuous 3D culture. Gliospheres and PDOs could also be regenerated upon cryofreezing and reinitiating cultures after more than a year of cryo-storage. At the early stages of gliospheres and PDO cultures, there should be very little cell death. By day 7, the majority of the gliosphere culture should appear homogeneous in distribution and density across the culture well. Between days 7–14, gliospheres typically express NESTIN (≥40%), low levels of GFAP (more detectable from GBMs with astrocytic origin), and low/undetectable TUJ1 and GALC. When differentiation of these gliospheres is induced with serum and/or culture on polyornithine-coated slides, NESTIN is downregulated and gliospheres show relatively more GFAP, TUJ1-expressing cells and rarely some GALC-expressing cells. On the other hand, GBM PDOs starting from day 14 spontaneously express NESTIN (&gt;50%), and GFAP, TUJ1 and GALC (≥20%) without induction of differentiation. GBM PDOs appear darker under the microscope as cell density increases.</p>
<p>GBM PDOs contain highly heterogenous cellular subtype populations, recapitulating the key expression profiles and tumor cell phenotypes in GBM patients (<a href="#bib1">Chadwick et al., 2020</a>). When using the original GBM tissue to generate PDOs and gliospheres, it is necessary to determine which of the four main cellular neurodevelopmental states: mesenchymal (MES), astrocytic (AC), oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPC) and proneuronal progenitor cells (NPC) states (<a href="#bib3">Neftel et al., 2019</a>) are represented in the originating tissues, GBM PDOs, and gliospheres. Molecular subtype profiling should be performed with combination of exome sequencing (e.g., glioseq), RNA sequencing, and qPCR of subtype targets. <i>CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA</i> copy number variations (CNVs) and NF1 mutations influence GBM cellular state (<a href="#bib3">Neftel et al., 2019</a>) and should be determined to define GBM subtypes. Parity in expression profiles between originating GBM and PDOs remains high (≥90%) in the first 2–4 weeks of PDO cultures.</p>
<p>Drug testing in PDOs is done by measuring intracellular ATP levels of treated PDO cells compared with untreated cells from the same patient GBM PDOs to determine GI<sub>50</sub> for each drug. Synergy screens of dose response matrices are used for drug combination to determine the Bliss score using the Synergy Finder application. Upon drug treatment, IF using antibodies against Ki67 and GFAP are indicative of antiproliferative (anti-Ki67) and anti-GBM specific (anti-GFAP) activity and against BMI1 and pS6 to detect on-target activities against self-renewal (anti-BMI1) and PI3K/mTOR (anti-pS6) activities respectively, and to validate combination therapy. Promising drug sensitivity responses from novel and combined drugs can then be validated <i>in vivo</i> in mouse PDOXs to assess the effects of crossing the BBB and tumor microenvironment (TME) for clinical translation into novel GBM therapy. Moreover, correlation of drug sensitivity profiles with clinical responses to the same drugs can be done to further establish the power of using PDOs to predict responses to therapy in precision medicine oncology clinical trials.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>We have successfully utilized this protocol to generate PDOs from multiple GBM patient-derived material. We have also generated PDOXs from the same GBMs. However, the efficiency of PDO formation and both gliosphere and PDO growth rates varies between patient samples. We have found that this variation is largely dependent on the quality of the surgically resected tissue and the proliferative nature of each tumor. As such, we recommend establishing gliospheres or PDOs for at least 1 or 2 weeks before attempting to generate PDOXs. Additionally, the use of growth factor reduced Matrigel droplets as an ECM source for PDOs during the 3D culturing process results in better efficiency. However, Matrigel is animal-derived and there is some variability among batches that may confound the phenotypic cellular responses in drug testing. We are also utilizing chemically defined synthetic ECMs as xenogeneic-free reagents (amenable to clinical translation) and examining each type for reproducibility against Matrigel. These future optimizations will be important for developing clinical-grade drug testing assays but may add unnecessary expense when such stringency may not be required. We regularly interchange xenogeneic and xenogeneic-free ECM reagents without altering the protocol, although this should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the end user. Finally, prolonged 3D culture and growth factor selection might limit the preservation of immune, endothelial, microglial, and nerve cell components of the GBM TME. While these stromal components may be reintroduced in coculture, and/or modeled in mouse PDOXs, we are currently investigating multiple conditions that reproduce the precise bidirectional crosstalk of stromal cells with tumor cells by supplementation of key growth factors to maintain the stromal components of PDOs beyond the 12-week timeline, which is the longest reported time for maintaining some components of the TME in 3D culture. By improving culture conditions, PDOs could better model tumor and TME heterogeneity and allow for improved prediction of drug sensitivity for clinical applications.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>GBM tissue has highly necrotic areas leading to an inability to establish PDOs (step 2 in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>During processing of tissues, light debridement by removing dead and necrotic areas (darker in color) compared to remaining tumor (red in color) could improve the potential of establishing PDOs. The use of Primocin in collection media and neurobasal media including the use of EMEM and addition of sodium pyruvate and hydrocortisone, particularly during the first week of 3D culture establishment, improves the rates of gliosphere and PDO formation. Cultures should be closely monitored during the first three days after plating for potential bacterial and fungal infections. Regular tests should be performed to ensure that the cultures remain free of mycoplasma.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The genetic background of the tumor is unknown at the time of establishing PDO (step 8 in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>GBM PDOs are used for testing drug responses as early as 2 weeks after establishing 3D cultures. Ideally, they should be paired retrospectively upon receiving sequencing and expression profiling data of the originating tumor once completed. At a minimum, histological, genetic and IHC analysis of key markers should be established to determine the extent of PDOs representing the original tumor. This is critical as it is possible that culture heterogeneity is potentially lost when PDO lines are expanded and selection is applied, therefore, it is recommended to establish parity with the original tumor using tissue from the earliest time possible after tumor resection, and if not possible, then during the first passage of PDOs. Utilizing PDOs derived from additional patient samples with similar GBM subtypes could be considered, yet we emphasize that PDOs without the original genetic background are not true representative models for precision therapy.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>It is easy to aspirate the spheres/organoids when removing fluids (i.e., media, PBS, fixative) from the wells (steps 7 and 8 in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Tilting the plate and slowly aspirating from the surface of the media/plate interface will help minimize the number of spheres/organoids that are lost throughout the fixation and antibody staining process. Alternatively, working under a dissecting microscope will help track the organoids/spheres throughout the process. Though, this might be laborious and time consuming.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Prolonged incubation with primary antibody might yield unwanted background (step 38 in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is important to optimize this procedure based on sphere/organoid type, and size. It is recommended that steps 38a–38f be followed first on a trial sample before deciding to utilize the prolonged primary incubation noted above. Always make sure to have a negative control with no primary antibody added in order to check for unwanted non-specific background.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Immunofluorescence analysis is not clear or difficult to interpret (step 38 in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Optimization of each antibody is required to achieve optimum staining. Optimization can be performed using GBM cell lines of similar genetic background to the PDOs and cultured in the same 3D sphere/organoid culture conditions. Utilizing positive staining control from known reactive cells and no primary antibody negative controls allow determining the specificity of the staining. Performing additional steps such as antigen retrieval, blocking and using longer incubations can be performed while controlling for any unwanted background staining with additional controls during staining and imaging.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Inconsistencies in drug responses due to intra-GBM heterogeneity (step 46 in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We suggest that drug testing readouts are assessed using different experimental approaches by determining on-target activity and synergy in combination therapy using multiple PDO models with similar GBM subtypes. When considering personalized therapy, an accurate integration of exome and RNA sequencing data to identify GBM subtypes is essential. To account for spatial intratumor heterogeneity and difference between core and edge GBM cells, isolating and propagating PDOs from multiple tumor sites within the same GBM would strengthen the predictive value of PDOs in drug sensitivity assays.</p>
