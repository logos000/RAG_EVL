<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Sodium appetite is a state that motivates animals to consume normally unappetizing concentrations of sodium. Here we describe a protocol to induce sodium appetite in mice by furosemide-induced diuresis and measure sodium intake using volumetric drinking tubes. This protocol induces sodium appetite rapidly and can be used to assess the effect of various treatments on sodium appetite. This protocol does not require electronic equipment and can be implemented easily.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00732-2/sref6">Park et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparation of sodium chloride solution</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<ol>
<li>Preparation of 300 mM sodium solutions
<ol type="a">
<li>Weigh 17.53 g of sodium chloride.</li>
<li>Dissolve sodium chloride in 1,000 mL of distilled water.
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Autoclave the solution.</div>
</li>
<li>Allow the solution to cool back to room temperature before use.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The concentration of sodium chloride may need to be adjusted according to the study. At 300 mM, sodium chloride is mildly unappetizing to B6 mice in sodium-replete conditions (Bachmanov et al.<i>,</i> 2002). 500 mM sodium chloride, a more unappetizing concentration, has also been used in many other studies (e.g., <a href="#bib4">Jarvie and Palmiter., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib7">Resch et al., 2017</a>).</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of furosemide</h3>
<p>Furosemide, with low-sodium or sodium-deficient diet, has been widely used to induce sodium appetite since earlier studies in rats (<a href="#bib3">Jalowiec, 1974</a>) and mice (<a href="#bib8">Rowland and Fregly, 1988</a>). We have optimized the protocol for easy and affordable use in mice. For instance, experiments described in step 3 below for “habituation of mice” as well as steps 7 and 8 for “sodium depletion” and steps 11 and 12 for “two-bottle assay” have been optimized to reliably and accurately measure the volume of fluid intake using volumetric drinking tubes and Lixit valves.</p>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Preparation of 10 mL furosemide (10 mg/mL)
<ol type="a">
<li>Weigh out 100 mg of furosemide.</li>
<li>Place a small beaker on a stirring plate and fill with 8 mL of sterile 0.9% saline and a stirrer.</li>
<li>Place a pH meter into solution.</li>
<li>Pour furosemide powder into saline. Furosemide will not dissolve at first.</li>
<li>Dissolve NaOH into saline until pH reaches 10.0–10.2.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Take note of the volume of NaOH used. In our lab, this typically requires around 410 μL of 1M NaOH.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> When 410 μL of 1M NaOH is added directly to saline without furosemide, this typically brings the pH of the saline to 12.6–12.7 pH. The presence of furosemide lowers the pH of the entire solution.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Solution must be at a basic pH, otherwise it will not dissolve furosemide.</div>
</li>
<li>Start stirring to fully dissolve furosemide into solution.</li>
<li>Slowly add HCl into solution, until pH reaches 8.2–8.5.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In our lab, this typically requires around 100 μL of 1M HCl.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Take note of the volume of HCl used added into solution, so that the final volume of the solution can be accurately calculated for the next step.</div>
</li>
<li>Fill the remaining solution to 10 mL with sterile 0.9% saline.</li>
<li>Filter furosemide solution through a 0.45 μm filter.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The pH of furosemide solutions may lower slightly when injected into an animal, thus avoid bringing the solution to completely neutral pH. Pharmaceutical grade furosemide (10 mg/mL) can be used as a substitute. Some institutions may require use of pharmaceutical grade furosemide for animal experiments.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Habituation of mice</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 7 days</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Habituate mice to volumetric drinking tubes. We have used both MedAssociates Volumetric Drinking Tube w/Standard Lixit for mouse and Volumetric Drinking Tube w/Deluxe Lixit for mouse. Ensure that the type of volumetric drinking tubes (Standard Lixit or Deluxe Lixit) for sodium solution and water are the same for each mouse.
<ol type="a">
<li>Place drinking tubes into mice home cages. We achieve this in our lab by inserting the ends of the tubes between the metal rails on the lids of the home cages. We use physical force to adjust the width between the metal rails on the lids, if required, to ensure the ends of the tubes are tightly fastened between the rails (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). This is to ensure a “plug and play” type of connection.</li>
<li>Fill one tube with distilled water and the other tube with 300 mM NaCl solution.
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Mice can be handled lightly during this period to reduce stress during future experiments.</div>
</li>
<li>During this time we replace both tubes every 3 days to clean and refill. Furthermore, we clean sodium chloride containing tubes whenever we notice rust forming. We find that MedAssociates Volumetric Drinking Tubes are able to hold enough water to keep mice hydrated for 3 days when filled to their maximum capacity. We clean the tubes using the methods explained in steps 7 and 8 of this protocol.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Experimental procedures should be performed in compliance with institutional animal welfare guidelines. These procedures were conducted according to the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. KA2018-80).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> When using volumetric drinking tubes with Lixit, researchers should carefully check the instructions for the equipment as well as guidelines from their animal facility to ensure a proper operation.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> During this time, mice will drink the sodium solutions in small amounts (Need-free sodium intake). The typical amount of need-free sodium intake differs according to the strain of mice, concentration of solution and sex of the mice (<a href="#bib10">Tordoff et al., 2007</a>). A study from <a href="#bib1">Bachmanov et al. (2002)</a> measured the typical need-free sodium preference of B6 mice to be around 30%, when presented with 300 mM NaCl vs water.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>24 h after diuresis, followed by rehydration and access to sodium-deficient diets, mice typically lose on average around 7 ± 2 % of their body weight, ranging from 3% to 13% and drink at least 3 mL of water.</p>
<p>During a 4-h session, we find that mice will typically drink around 0.9 ± 0.3 mL (mean ± stdev) of 300 mM sodium chloride solution, 0.4 ± 0.2 mL (mean ± stdev) of distilled water and have a preference ratio (total NaCl solution consumed/(total water consumed + total NaCl solution consumed)) of 0.7 ± 0.15.</p>
<p>If non sodium-depleted mice are required as controls, then sodium-containing diet can be introduced at step 6, ensuring that the diet composition differs only in sodium content with the sodium-deficient diet. Mice with access to sodium-containing diets should have little decrease in body weight 24 h after furosemide injections and show little sodium appetite.</p>
<p>Potassium chloride (300 mM) and sodium bicarbonate solutions (300 mM) can also be introduced as negative and positive controls to test the specificity of behaviour towards the sodium ion.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Furosemide-induced sodium depletion does not mimic sodium depletion in a natural context. This protocol may engage other pathways that are not normally involved in regulating sodium appetite as a response to a chronic deprivation of dietary sodium (<a href="#bib2">Geerling and Loewy, 2008</a>). Sodium depletion through maintenance on a sodium-deficient diet may be more suitable, depending on the goals of the researcher.</p>
<p>Real-time data acquisition is not possible with volumetric drinking tubes and measurements introduce a degree of disturbance for the animals. Researchers that require real-time data and/or less disturbance of animals may consider electronic alternatives such as those used in <a href="#bib4">Jarvie and Palmiter (2017)</a> or lickometer-installed cages (<a href="#bib6">Park et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib7">Resch et al., 2017</a>) for measuring fluid intake.</p>
<p>Protocols provided here have been validated using male mice. Experiments using female mice may require somewhat modified protocols.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Mice do not drink at least 3 mL of water during sodium depletion (in step 10 of “<a href="#sec2.2">two-bottle assay</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If mice have not drunk enough water, furosemide solution is likely to have been made incorrectly or expired. Also check that Lixit valves are not blocked by air bubbles by pressing on the valve lever and ensuring that liquid flows (step 9 of “<a href="#sec2.1">sodium depletion</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Mice do not lose weight after diuresis (in step 10 of “<a href="#sec2.2">two-bottle assay</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If mice have drunk water but have not lost weight, sodium is likely to have been present in the home cage during sodium depletion. Ensure that cage bedding is replaced and that lids are cleaned, as small amounts of chow may be hidden inside bedding or encrusted on lids. Ensure that sodium chloride solutions are taken out of home cages. Ensure that sodium-deficient diet is being provided during the depletion step and not sodium-containing diet (steps 2–6 of “<a href="#sec2.1">sodium depletion</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Mice drink too much water or sodium chloride (&gt;4 mL within 4 h) during the two-bottle assay (in step 14 of “<a href="#sec2.2">two-bottle assay</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Drinking tubes are likely to be leaking. Check to see that the plastic tubes do not have any cracks or leaks. Check to see valves are not clogged. Bedding can sometimes get stuck inside the Lixit valve, thus jamming the lever and causing liquid to continuously leak out. If this continues to be a problem, using volumetric drinking tubes with deluxe Lixit valves (PHM-127A-15, MedAssociates) can ameliorate this issue.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Mice do not drink enough fluid or do not drink any sodium chloride solution at all during the two-bottle assay (in step 14 of “<a href="#sec2.2">two-bottle assay</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Drinking tube valves may be blocked. Check that all air bubbles have been removed and ensure that liquid flows from the valve when levers are pushed on (step 12a of “<a href="#sec2.2">two bottle assay</a>”). Valves may have become too rusty; ensure that valves are clean by removing rust before proceeding with two bottle assays. Mice may not be accustomed to the sodium chloride solution-containing tube in their home cage. Ensure that the mice are properly habituated to the tubes before testing. Mice may not be accustomed to furosemide-induced sodium appetite and may require an additional trial to observe robust sodium ingestion.</p>
<p>Although we have not personally conducted these experiments, furosemide-induced diuresis causes changes increased urinary volume and urinary sodium concentrations, which may also be used to confirm diuresis (<a href="#bib3">Jalowiec, 1974</a>).</p>
