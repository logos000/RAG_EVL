<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>High throughput, temporally controlled, reproducible quantitative behavioral assays are important for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying behavior. Here, we provide a step-by-step training protocol for a probabilistic Pavlovian conditioning task, where two auditory cues predict probabilistic outcomes with different contingencies. This protocol allows us to study the differential behavioral and neuronal correlates of expected and surprising outcomes. It has been tested in combination with chronic <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic manipulations in ChAT-Cre and PV-Cre mouse lines.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00501-3/sref6">Hegedüs et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Pavlovian or classical conditioning is an associative learning paradigm. As a hallmark, the outcome does not depend on the actions of the performing agent, as in the case of Ivan Pavlov’s famous experiment, in which his dog formed an association between a previously neutral auditory stimulus and food reward (<a href="#bib3">Fanselow and Poulos, 2005</a>). This allows the experimenter to have full control over the outcome contingencies, making this task ideal for probing the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of probabilistic outcomes (<a href="#bib13">Pearce and Hall, 1980</a>; <a href="#bib17">Schultz et al., 1997</a>). This Pavlovian training protocol was tested in combination with extracellular tetrode recordings (<a href="#bib6">Hegedüs et al., 2021</a>) and optogenetic tagging of neurons. We confirmed that it is suitable for optogenetic manipulations and fiber photometry experiments as well. Although not tested, we believe that it would also allow investigation of the effects of pharmacological or chemogenetic manipulations on associative learning. We further envision that, with an addition of a head plate designed for imaging window surgeries, it could be used in combination with two photon imaging. Before presenting the training protocol, we describe the preparatory phase of the experiment including animal welfare, headbar surgery and proper handling of mice.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">The training setup</h3>
<p>The training apparatus consists of a sound-attenuated training chamber, a head-fixation platform, an open source behavior control unit (Bpod, Sanworks), peripheries for interacting with the animal (lick port, water and air delivery systems, speakers to provide sound stimuli), a camera, optional open source stimulator unit (PulsePal, Sanworks (<a href="#bib16">Sanders and Kepecs, 2014</a>)) and data acquisition board (Open Ephys (<a href="#bib19">Siegle et al., 2017</a>)), and a PC (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>A and 1B). The custom-built sound-insulated Faraday-cage minimizes environmental noise (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C) and electric noise during the experiment. In the center of the box, an adjustable platform is placed along with two headbar holders to keep the mice’s head in a fixed position during the training sessions. A lick port delivering water reward and a cannula delivering air puff as punishment are adjusted to the animal’s position. A camera is placed at the top right corner of the box and speakers for delivering auditory cues are mounted on the sidewalls of the box. The behavioral protocol is controlled via an open source closed-loop finite state machine (Bpod, Sanworks, see <a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>A and 1B). This setup allows us to train mice on high-precision behavioral protocols with temporally controlled stimuli (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D). Details of this open source multipurpose training platform were published in (<a href="#bib20">Solari et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sec1.2">Animal welfare</h3>
<p>Our experiments were carried out using ChAT-Cre, PV-Cre and 3×Tg-AD Bl6 (<a href="#bib12">Oddo et al., 2003</a>) young adult (3–6 months) and aged (12–21 months) mice of both sexes.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Before the experiment, ensure that animal care and all experiments are conducted according to the relevant ethical guidelines, reviewed and approved by your institute’s animal welfare and ethical committee, as well as all necessary regulatory agencies.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Headbar surgery</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h + 1 week recovery period</div>
<p>We provide a description of our surgical protocol for mounting a headbar, which is used for head fixation while training mice in the head-fixed setup. We use titanium headbars weighing 0.27 g (dimensions, 19 mm × 3 mm × 1 mm); however, we expect other headfixation systems to provide similar results.</p>
<ol>
<li>Put the mouse on the scale and measure its pre-surgery weight.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>General anesthesia
<ol type="a">
<li>Briefly place the mouse in an anesthesia induction chamber (custom-built or commercial) to induce anesthesia by isoflurane inhalation.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Continuously monitor breathing during the induction.</div>
</li>
<li>Inject a mixture of ketamine-xylazine intraperitoneally (83 mg/kg and 17 mg/kg respectively, dissolved in saline).</li>
<li>Confirm the loss of nociceptive reflexes by pinching the paws/tail with surgical tweezers.</li>
<li>Monitor breathing and nociceptive reflexes throughout the surgery.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Shave the scalp. It is recommended to apply a small amount of water on the fur before shaving to limit the spread of potential airborne allergens.</li>
<li>Disinfect the scalp skin with Betadine.</li>
<li>Inject Lidocaine (or other approved local anesthetic) subcutaneously to achieve local anesthesia of the scalp skin and connective tissue.</li>
<li>Fix the animal’s head in the stereotaxic frame.</li>
<li>Cover the eyes with eye ointment (e.g., Corneregel) to protect them from dehydration and strong light.</li>
<li>Remove the skin, connective tissue and periosteum from the calvaria using surgical scissors, forceps and scraper. Optionally, make small scratches on the skull with a scalpel to increase the surface for better adhesion of the dental cement.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Make sure that the skull is perfectly clean and dry. Tissue debris can lead to improper adhesion of the surgical cement and detachment of the implant.</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Level the skull along both the lateral and antero-posterior axes. We recommend using two symmetrical points over the parietal plates, 2 mm from the sagittal suture for lateral leveling (<a href="#bib7">Király et al., 2020</a>).</li>
<li>Cover the calvaria surface with high-adhesive dental cement (e.g., Metabond).</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Most high-adhesive cements should be kept and mixed on ice to aid polymerization.</div>
<ol start="11">
<li>Mount the headbar on the top of the skull by using acrylic powder and liquid resin (e.g., from Lang Dental). We recommend positioning the headbar over or right in front of Bregma. Implanting a small wood stick holder can help positioning the head of the mouse during head-fixation.</li>
<li>Once the dental cement is cured, remove the mouse from the stereotax.</li>
<li>Place the mouse on the scale and measure its weight, now with the implant mounted.</li>
<li>Inject analgesic according to your approved protocol (e.g., buprenorphine, BupaQ).</li>
<li>We recommend injecting 0.5 mL saline subcutaneously to prevent dehydration. It is recommended to distribute large amounts to multiple injection sites.</li>
<li>Put the mouse in its homecage. Place the cage on a heating pad until the mouse wakes up to prevent hypothermia.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Animals were single-housed from the day of the surgery during the entire course of the experiment to prevent aggression and damage to the implants, and to allow proper control over water intake.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Avoid low cage tops that can block the movement of implanted mice. Cage tops can also be used upside down if they do not leave enough space for the implanted mice.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.4">Handling, water restriction</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15–20 min / day for 1 week</div>
<p>After surgery, mice are allowed a 1-week recovery period. Handling and water restriction of mice starts 1–2 weeks prior to the training protocol. Animals are handled and habituated to human touch on a daily basis. Below, we provide a short description of our handling protocol (see also <a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>A–2C).</p>
<figure id="fig2"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/978-Fig2.jpg" alt="Fig2.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 2. Animal handling</div>
<p>(A–C) Different phases of handling mice: the experimenter putting one hand in the cage (A), lifting the mouse (B) and letting it explore (C). Note that the mouse in panel B was implanted with a moveable tetrode drive besides the headbar, while the mouse in panel C had fixed bilateral optic fiber implants. Note also that lifting the mouse by the tail should be avoided; however, gently holding the tail during lifting can prevent the mouse from falling.</p>
<p>(D) Provide water in a weigh boat or equivalent container.</p>
<p>(E) Measure the weight daily.</p>
<p>(F) Mice drop weight at the beginning of water restriction, but the weight loss should be moderate, and the weight should stabilize after a few days and remain stable throughout the experimental phase.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause point:</span> It is possible to include longer delays between headbar surgery and start of handling and water restriction. However, please note that if the training is combined with recording, then extending this delay could result in decreased signal quality.</div>
<ol start="17">
<li>Transport the animals to the behavioral testing room or facility a few days prior to the beginning of handling (typically ∼1 week after surgery).</li>
<li>The experimenter opens the cage in a way that half of it is still covered by the top and places his/her gloved hand into the cage and allows the mice to sniff it or climb onto it.</li>
<li>The experimenter lifts the mouse and places it onto his/her open palm a little above the cage; this way the animal starts to get used to human touch but still has the option to climb off.</li>
<li>If the animal is not trying to escape from the experimenter, he/she should lift the mouse and let it explore and sniff the experimenter’s hand.</li>
<li>Measure the weight of the mouse.</li>
<li>Reward the animal with a snack (e.g., sunflower seed) after the handling. We found that mice became used to human touch sooner when the handling process was associated with food reward, in spite of the fact that no food restriction was applied.</li>
<li>Water restriction protocol can be started in parallel with handling (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>D–2F). Place a small weigh boat into the cage and fill it with 1 mL of water daily (1–1.5 mL for aged mice), measured with a syringe. Below we provide a list of behavioral and appearance changes that can be signs of dehydration; observing these signs at any time, the daily amount of water should be raised, or the water restriction should be suspended. Signs of severe dehydration in mice:
<ol type="a">
<li>After pinching the skin over the back, the skin remains bunched up</li>
<li>Mice are weak and having trouble with gripping the cage bar</li>
<li>Mice are curled up in the corner and barely moving or exploring</li>
<li>Shrunken or recessed eyes</li>
<li>Fuzzy facial and back fur</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The weight of the animals should be measured daily, and their behavior and potential signs of dehydration should be monitored regularly.</div>

<p>We provide a detailed description of the training protocol from the beginning to the point when the mice have learned the task (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A and 3B). We use a 1 training session/day protocol, i.e., each training step we describe here should be performed on consecutive days. The probabilistic training protocol consists of two cues and associated reinforcement; one cue predicts likely reward (80% reward, 10% punishment, 10% omission) and the other cue predicts likely punishment (25% reward, 65% punishment, 10% omission).</p>

<li>Then, a 1 s long pure tone is played, followed by a variable 200–400 ms delay (300 ms on average, with uniform distribution), after which the animal receives water reward in 80% of the trials, in a pseudorandomized order.</li>
<li>In this stage, there is no punishment; therefore, the reinforcer is omitted in the other 20% of the trials.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>During successful training, mice form an association between the outcome predicting cues and the reinforcers. They learn the task contingencies, which is expressed by their differential anticipatory licking in response to the likely reward and likely punishment predicting cues (see <a href="#quantification-and-statistical-analysis">quantification and statistical analysis</a>). We consider a licking response anticipatory when it happens after the cue onset but before reinforcement delivery (∼1.2 s time window from cue onset in the present protocol). Note that for learning outcome probabilities, mice have to integrate rewards over multiple trials. Therefore, this is a harder task than associating specific cues with different reward size, which can be inferred from a single trial (<a href="#bib21">Stephenson-Jones et al., 2020</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>We suggest that simple behavioral analysis should be performed on each training day to monitor the progress of the animals during training. Mice start licking the water spout after cue presentation in the anticipation of reward. As training progresses and mice start learning the cue contingencies, they develop differential anticipatory licking in response to the cues: they lick more vigorously (with higher frequency) if reward is more likely. We routinely calculate and visualize lick rasters (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A) and peri-event time histogram of licking activity (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>B and 4C) aligned to cue onset to judge the difference in anticipatory lick rate after the sound cue. Learning curves can be plotted by tracking the changes in anticipatory lick rate across training days (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>D). Reaction times can be measured as the time difference between cue onset and the first lick of the animal (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>E). We use the custom-developed ultimate_psth.m Matlab code for calculating anticipatory lick rates, available at <a href="https://github.com/hangyabalazs/CellBase">https://github.com/hangyabalazs/CellBase</a>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This training protocol allows efficient training of mice on a probabilistic Pavlovian task, enabling direct control over outcome contingencies. Nevertheless, it has some limitations.</p>
<p>Training multiple animals in parallel can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, limiting the number of mice. This could be solved by fully automating the training (<a href="#bib14">Qiao et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib2">Birtalan et al., 2020</a>); however, that would either require using voluntary head-fixation protocols (<a href="#bib18">Scott et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib1">Aoki et al., 2017</a>) or switching to a freely behaving paradigm.</p>
<p>Efficient training requires some level of specific expertise from the experimenter. In our experience, the crucial skill is to learn the proper positioning of the lick port. While the feedback on behavioral performance from the Bpod behavior control system is useful, it is possible that the mouse can perform the task but stops early due to suboptimal positioning of the lick port. If this happens early in training or multiple times, it may influence performance on the long term. This could be improved by including a motorized stage for moving the lick port, which would allow reliable positioning and even enable automating this important step.</p>
<p>In Pavlovian conditioning tasks, the outcome does not depend on the animals’ actions, endowing the experimenter with full control over the outcomes. However, as a downside, it is hard to measure the animals’ performance and get access to the level of learning. We address this by using the difference in anticipatory lick rate that develops throughout the task (see <a href="#quantification-and-statistical-analysis">quantification and statistical analysis</a>). Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that a linear relationship exists between learning outcome probabilities and anticipatory licking, which complicates the interpretation of performance comparisons across mice.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The animal might show signs of strong distress (vocalizing and attempting to escape) at the first session that prevents starting the Operant phase (step 2).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Remove the animal from the setup immediately to prevent further stress. Take a couple more days before the training, and while handling the animal, place it on the setup platform and let it explore. Consider giving it the daily amount of water on the setup platform as well. This way the experimenter can reduce the anxiety of the animal associated with head restraint.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The animal does not lick for water in the Operant phase (step 2).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Repeat the Operant phase at another time. Do not leave the mouse in the setup for an extended period, which often causes stress.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The animal shows impulsive licking behavior that interferes with the training. If a no-lick period is used in the protocol, this behavior leads to multiple restarting of most trials (step 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A brief period of free water before or at the beginning of the training session may help reduce impulsive licking. Counterintuitively, larger reward sizes can lead to impulsive/poor behavior (<a href="#bib8">Kuchibhotla et al., 2019</a>). We suggest starting from a reward size of 5 μL at the beginning of training and decreasing it gradually to 2–3 μL for best performance.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The mouse stops licking upon the introduction of punishment (step 5).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The first introduction of the punishment during training (Stage 3) might cause a setback in the animal’s performance. First, repeat Stage 3 on the next day. If the problem persists, it might help training one or two more days at Stage 2; however, overtraining on intermediate phases should generally be avoided. As a rule of thumb, advance the mouse to the next stage as soon as it responds to at least 30% of the likely reward cues.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The animal stops licking early during the training session (step 7).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Allowing some free water by briefly opening the water valve via Bpod might help increase motivation. When training multiple animals sequentially, training at a slightly different time of day by changing the order of mice may help optimize their individual performance. However, try this only if problems occur; otherwise keeping the same order of mice helps develop consistent performance.</p>
