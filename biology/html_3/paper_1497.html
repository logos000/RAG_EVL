<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Laplace pressure is an important regulator of cell dynamics and behavior during cytokinesis. Here, we provide a protocol to measure Laplace pressure in cultured cells using a micropipette and describe the steps for imaging the actin cortex during cytokinesis. The quantification steps allow tracing dynamic change in Laplace pressure and displaying dynamic response of the actin cortex during cytokinesis in HeLa cells. This protocol can be applied to any cultured cell type during various stages of cell division.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(22)00119-8/sref5">Wang et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<li>Displacement measurement system: laser displacement sensor (LK-G500, Keyence), data acquisition card (USB3106A, ART), computer;</li>
<li>Two height gauges with hand wheel, measuring range 0–1,500 mm, measurement accuracy ± 0.04 mm and resolution 0.01 mm;</li>
<li>Two circular flat plates;</li>
<li>Two cylindrical water reservoirs (clear plastic, 12 cm height, 8 cm diameter);</li>
<li>Two 3-way T-port hand valves;</li>
<li>A 50 mL syringe;</li>
<li>Two 10 mL syringes;</li>
<li>Two syringe needles with blunt tips (21G);</li>
<li>A micropipette holder;</li>
<li>Five silicone tubes;</li>
<li>A glass-bottom Petri dish (35 mm);</li>
<li>Hot melt adhesives;</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Set up the micropipette aspiration system.
<ol type="a">
<li>Mount two circular flat plates onto each height gauge to support two water reservoirs, which are clamped by four fixtures on the plates.</li>
<li>Mount a laser displacement sensor to one of the two circular flat plates to measure real-time displacement of the water reservoir fixed on flat plate. Then connect the laser displacement sensor to data processing module, which consists of the data acquisition card and the host computer. The data acquisition card performs data synchronous acquisition work and sends the displacement data to the host computer for processing, graphing, and storing.</li>
<li>Fix the two water reservoirs onto the flat plates, and connect them through a 3-way T-port hand valve #1.</li>
<li>Connect the syringe (50 mL) to a 3-way T-port hand valve #2, which is then linked to valve #1 and micropipette holder, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Ensure the leakproofness of tube joints and valve joints to prevent water leakage, which significantly influences accuracy of the measurement results.</div>

<li>Pump the syringe (50 mL) to flush out the tubes and remove air bubbles if necessary.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Make sure there are no air bubbles in the system since the compressible air bubbles strongly affect the measurement accuracy. To this end, use the syringe to dislodge any air bubbles.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> When the water in the syringe (50 mL) is used up, unscrew carefully the tube from syringe tip. Once the water is refilled, insert the piston into the syringe. Invert the syringe and push the piston up slowly, forcing the air out of the syringe. While connecting the tube to the syringe tip, the syringe is placed vertically and make sure a hemispherical water droplet has formed at its tip by gently pushing the piston. This will prevent air bubbles from being trapped at the tube joint.</div>

<li>Clamp the micropipette holder to the micromanipulator.
<div class="note">

</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Cells undergoing mitosis, on which we focus here, could be rinsed away due to poor adhesion to the culture dishes.

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Make sure to rinse the cells to remove any debris that could block the micropipette.</div>
<h3 id="sec2.2">Prepare and mount micropipette</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15–30 min</div>
<p>Make micropipette from borosilicate glass capillary tubes (TW150-4, World Precision Instruments, Inc.) using the micropipette puller and microforge, as described in the following. Then mount the micropipette onto the pipette holder that allows fine control of the pipette movements in three dimensions.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Fabricating glass micropipettes (<a href="#mmc1">Methods video S1</a>). <a href="#sec5.1">Troubleshooting 1</a> and <a href="#sec5.3">2</a>
<ol type="a">
<li>Stretch the micropipette from a glass capillary (i.d./o.d. = 1.12 mm/1.5 mm) using a micropipette puller. To fabricate a pipette with an inner diameter of 1–2 μm and a taper length around 2 mm, we adopt the two-stage pull mode and use the following settings—Distance 1: 3 mm, Distance 2: 6 mm, Heat 1: 65 V, Heat 2: 60 V, Weights: 250 g.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The shape of micropipette depends strongly on its properties and the parameter settings of micropipette puller.</div>
</li>
<li>Cut the taper of the pulled micropipette at the desired micropipette radius (about 1.5–2 μm) by placing it against a hot metal wire in microforge. Then polish the end of micropipette by bringing it close to the heated bead to remove the sharp edges.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> For micropipette tip with a radius too large, the whole cell can be easily swallowed into the micropipette even for a small aspiration pressure. By contrast, membrane-cortex detachment occurs frequently due to the higher aspiration pressure needed to suck the cell into the micropipette tip with a radius too small. It thus goes against the experiment measuring for the tip radius which is set too large or too small. According to our experience, the appropriate radius of the micropipette tip, depending on the cell type, ranges from 1/4 to 1/3 of the radius of the HeLa cell.</div>
</li>
<li>Place the micropipette in micropipette puller. Adjust the position of micropipette so that its tip protrudes about 5 mm beyond the spiral-shaped heating elements of micropipette puller, as shown in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A.</li>
<li>Heat up the tip of the micropipette and bend it using another obsolete micropipette to an angle (typically 35–40 degrees) at which the tip will be allowed to approach the cell at a very shallow angle, as close to horizontal as possible.
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Micropipette can be passivated with, e.g., a β-casein solution to reduce adhesion of cells to the glass.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The micropipette tip should be smooth to make a good seal to the plasma membrane.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Keep the length of the bent part of micropipette tip as short as possible (5–8 mm) to increase the operating space as much as possible.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> When handling a micropipette, great care should be taken to avoid touching the tip. This will break the fragile tip and lead to the risk of inserting it into the body.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The fabricated micropipette can be stored for months at room temperature in a dust-free container. If no dust-free storage container is available, micropipettes have to be prepared on the day of the experiment. We recommend having extra on hand in case one is broken.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The micropipette tip can be also bent by using the microforge. In this approach, the filament of the microforge is heated up and progressively brought closer to the micropipette tip until it bends to the required angle (<a href="#bib1">Backholm and Bäumchen, 2019</a>).</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>We provide here a detailed, step-by-step protocol, which has enabled us to describe the dynamic, quantitative variations in the Laplace pressure during cytokinesis and to relate this variability to physiological influences. By optimizing the micropipette aspiration system, we realize the dynamic, quantitative measurement of the Laplace pressure during cytokinesis. In order to regulate the Laplace pressure and study the cellular response to the change of the Laplace pressure, we design a medium replacement device by which the cytokinetic HeLa cells can endure the hypotonic and hypertonic osmotic shocks by controlling the extracellular osmolarities. Further, we take the actin cortex as an example to discuss the effect of the Laplace pressure on the cellular behavior, and combine the live-cell imaging and the designed medium replacement device to display the density distributions of the actin cortex of the plasmid transfected HeLa cells undergoing cytokinesis in hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic media. Based on the quantitative measurement of the Laplace pressure of HeLa cells undergoing cytokinesis in the media with different osmolarities, the dynamic response of actin cortex to the change in the Laplace pressure is then established.</p>
<p>This protocol can be utilized to measure the dynamic Laplace pressure in other cell cycle phases during mitosis for different cell lines and extended to address further research questions regarding the intrinsic relation between the Laplace pressure and other cellular activities in combination with other technologies as required.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>In this protocol, we adopt a commonly used method to control suction pressure in micropipette aspiration systems through manually adjusting the height of a water reservoir. In order to measure the Laplace pressure for cells evolving from cleavage furrow emergence to contractile-ring contraction accomplishment, one has to keep adjusting the suction pressure to make the aspirated part of the HeLa cell in the micropipette to be roughly hemispherical in shape throughout cytokinesis. It is very difficult for an inexperienced user to accomplish such an operation. Even for a skilled operator, operation failure often occurs as well. In addition, it will easily result in the cell rupture and the failure of the experiment even only a few sharp edges are left on the micropipette tip, which contacts with cell membrane throughout the cytokinesis. Therefore, the micropipette tips must be finely polished with stringent quality.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The tip of micropipette is too long or too short (step 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the micropipette tip needs to be shorter, make the weight heavier, or decrease the heater value. On the contrary, if the micropipette tip needs to be longer, make the weight lighter, or increase the heater value.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The tip of micropipette is closed (step 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Cut the end of the pulled micropipette by placing it against a hot metal wire in microforge.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The air bubbles are trapped in the micropipette after mounting it onto the pipette holder (step 6).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Gently pump the syringe (50 mL) to dislodge any visible air bubbles in the micropipette.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The tip of the micropipette vibrates during the micropipette aspiration experiment (steps 8 and 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Turn on the anti-vibration table.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The laser displacement sensor is unavailable (step 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The real-time displacement of the water reservoir can also be recorded using a digital height gauge that allows measurements to be sent to a data collector. If the function of sending data is unavailable, the digital height gauge can be equipped with a camera instead.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>The micropipette tip is blocked by debris floating in the media even before the micropipette aspiration experiment (steps 10 and 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>On the one hand, repeatedly insert the micropipette through the air-media interface to remove the debris stuck on the micropipette tip. On the other hand, temporarily apply a positive pressure inside the micropipette by syringe to push debris back out of the tip and into the media. Additionally, to prevent blockage with debris, carefully rinse each dish of cells with PBS to remove the debris during cell preparation, and apply a slight positive pressure by the water reservoir before immersing the micropipette in the process of calibrating the micropipette aspiration system.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>The micropipette tip is always above the cell and cannot be placed in contact with the cell when positioning it to the cell using the micromanipulator (step 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Gently adjust the micropipette holder clamp to increase the angle of the micropipette relative to the microscope stage.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.15">Problem 8</h3>
<p>One is unable to grab the cell using micropipette (step 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.16">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This can attribute to different reasons. On the one hand, gently increase the suction pressure. On the other hand, check whether the micropipette tip is clogged by debris or closed. If so, refer to the Potential solution of Problems 2 and 5.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.17">Problem 9</h3>
<p>The Opti-MEM® medium is unavailable (step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.18">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The serum-free and antibiotic-free DMEM medium can be used as an alternative.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.19">Problem 10</h3>
<p>There is no Lipo8000<sup>TM</sup> transfection reagent available (step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.20">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The alternative transfection reagents such as Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen<sup>TM</sup>, Cat#L3000015) or Entranster<sup>TM</sup>-H4000 (Engreen, Cat#4000-5) can be used as a candidate.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.21">Problem 11</h3>
<p>The transfection efficiency of HeLa cell is low (step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.22">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, make sure that the cells are cultured in dishes no more than 24 h before transfection. Second, optimize the cell density so that the HeLa cells are 70–90% confluent on the day of transfection. Finally, optimize the ratio and the amount of reagents and plasmid.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.23">Problem 12</h3>
<p>The cell viability decreases after transfection (step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.24">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Adjust the amount of reagents used or reduce the incubation time of cells with transfection mixture.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.25">Problem 13</h3>
<p>The fluorescence intensity decreases during the imaging experiment due to fluorescence quenching (step 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.26">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Optimize the exposure time and the light intensity, or increase the time interval between image frames.</p>
