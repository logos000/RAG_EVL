<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Separation of highly enriched extracellular vesicles (EVs) fractions from milk is desirable for quantification, cargo analysis, functional characterization, and investigation as delivery vehicles for nutrients and/or therapeutics. However, a rigorous, reproducible protocol is lacking. This protocol considers a crucial aspect typically overlooked, i.e., that caseins are of similar size to, but more abundant than, EVs in milk. Our protocol combines acid pre-treatment and gradient ultracentrifugation, producing EV-enriched fractions suitable for downstream orthogonal characterization approaches.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00527-X/sref3">Mukhopadhya et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Casein micelles or contaminant-free EVs are best for milk EV characterization</li>
<li>Acid pre-treatment + gradient ultracentrifugation essential to obtain pure milk EV</li>
<li>Disrupted and fewer EVs identified in infant milk formula (IMF) than in skim milk</li>
<li>Notably lower signals of surface markers obtained from IMF EVs than skim milk EVs</li>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Here we demonstrate EV separation protocol from commercially available defatted milk (&lt; 1% fat), including bovine skim milk and from infant milk formula. However, this protocol can be broadly applied to milk from different species, including human milk as well as spray-dried milk.</p>
<p>Bovine skim milk (SM, (n=3 independent batches) and infant milk formula (IMF), prepared as recommended by the manufacturer (n=3 independent batches), were purchased from local vendors, as these are the typical sources that would be available to consumers to provide to infants/children. Crucially, a fresh batch of SM and IMF was prepared for each biological repeat experiment.</p>
<p>Each independent batch of SM and IMF was divided into 3 equal aliquots. One was untreated (NT), and the others were treated with either acetic acid (AA) or with HCl for isoelectric precipitation (IP), respectively, to remove abundant casein micelles. After the acid treatment and the three-step filtration, 38 mL of the resultant whey was used for differential ultracentrifugation (DUC) and 2.33 mL of the resultant whey was used for gradient ultracentrifugation (GUC) for separation of highly enriched EV fractions that can be characterized by protein visualization and quantification, nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, immunoblotting, and imaging flow cytometry. The GUC approach is more time-consuming (over 18 h) compared to the DUC method (just over 6 h) but, GUC generated the most highly EV-enriched fractions. However, we present both options so the researchers can make an informed choice when applying this to their studies of human milk, bovine milk, infant milk formula (IMF) and, indeed, milk from other species.</p>
<p>All relevant information on the experiment was submitted to <a href="https://evtrack.org/">EV-TRACK</a> knowledgebase (<a href="#bib6">Van Deun et al., 2017</a>) and the EV-TRACK ID: <a href="https://evtrack.org/search_results.php?evtraqid=ev190096&amp;pmid=&amp;author=&amp;compl_score=&amp;biofluid=&amp;study_aim=&amp;isolation_method=&amp;species=&amp;prot_methods=&amp;keyword=&amp;part_methods=&amp;year=&amp;submit=1">EV190096</a> was assigned and the score achieved was 100%.</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Acid treatment for removal on non-EV related proteins, in particular caseins</div>
<p>This figure outlines the two treatments performed on milk to remove non-EV related proteins, especially caseins as they can act as contaminant proteins due to their abundance and overlapping sizes. Both SM and IMF were either left untreated or treated with 6 N acetic acid (AA) or Hydrochloric acid (HCl). Post-acid treatment, for removal of the precipitates, samples were centrifuged on a benchtop centrifuge and further used in a 3-step filtration process, as shown in the figure. Of note, the non-treated samples were filtered only using the filter paper as filtration using syringe filters was not possible due to clogging of filters by milk proteins.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Commercially available SM and powdered IMF were used in this study. Fresh SM and freshly prepared IMF samples were always used for EV separation steps. The preparation of IMF from its powder form was performed exactly as recommended by its manufacturer, to replicate the product that would be prepared to feed to infants. Specifically, in the example shown in this paper, 4.4 g of IMF powder was mixed with 30 mL of water that had been freshly boiled and then allowed to cool naturally. When prepared following the instruction on the container, the IMF was described by its manufacturer as a ‘nutritionally complete’ breast milk substitute with 0.7 mg per 100 mL feed iron content.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Care should be taken when dissolving the IMF; only warm, not boiling, filtered water should be used for reconstituting the powder. We suggest following the manufacturer's recommendation when reconstituting any form of spray-dried IMF/milk to successfully separate EVs -as they would exist- from the source. Sterile tubes and filtered deionised water should be used for all steps.</div>
<ol>
<li>For the untreated samples, centrifuge 50 mL of SM or IMF at 2,000 <i>g</i> for 20 min at 4°C. Carefully collect the supernatant and discard the pellet containing any fat globules or debris. In case non-defatted milk is used as a starting material, centrifuge milk at 6,000 <i>g</i> for 10 min at 4°C to remove fats and then proceed with the supernatant and centrifuge at 2,000 <i>g</i> for 20 min at 4°C.</li>
<li>Pass this supernatant through Whatman<sup>TM</sup> Grade 1 filter paper (diameter 150 mm) using a glass funnel. Fold the filter paper in half and, then again, fold it to form a 90° center angle. Place the folded filter paper on one side in the funnel and open one layer on the other side to form a funnel. Carefully pour the supernatant and collect the filtrate in a fresh tube at the bottom of the funnel (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A).</li>
<li>The filtrate obtained from untreated SM is designated as SM_NT and the filtrate from untreated IMF is designated as IMF_NT.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>While previous studies have attempted to separate EVs from milk, in our published study (<a href="#bib3">Mukhopadhya et al., 2021</a>) we established that using ultracentrifugation alone is not adequate to remove most casein micelles from milk and that a pre-treatment is required to separate the most enriched EVs possible. Studies such as those described by <a href="#bib4">Somiya et al. (2018)</a> and <a href="#bib7">Yamauchi et al. (2018)</a> have reported the use of acetic acid or HCl, respectively. However, casein removal was not achieved. Additionally, <a href="#bib2">Benmoussa et al. (2017)</a> used a 4 step differential ultracentrifugation method, with 100,000 <i>g</i> as the final EV separation step, which might be a limitation of this study. Milk EVs are potentially separated by centrifugation at 200,000 <i>g</i>, as previously reported by <a href="#bib4">Somiya et al. (2018)</a>. Hence, to overcome this possible limitation, we added the 200,000 <i>g</i> ultracentrifugation step to our milk EV separation protocol. We reported that in our protocol, that includes IP pre-treatment and then GUC, while requiring a longer time than the DUC protocol, requires comparatively less starting material to achieve comparable amounts of EVs and the EVs separated can be successfully characterized.</p>
<p>Following the acid pre-treatment plus GUC protocol described here, the EV enriched fractions were separated from SM and IMF samples and were subjected to protein characterization, particle characterization, transmission electron microscopy and imaging flow cytometry analysis, comparing the status of EVs from IMF to those from its starting material SM. The details of the characterization steps and the outcomes can be accessed in our publication (<a href="#bib3">Mukhopadhya et al., 2021</a>).</p>
<p><b>Protein characterization:</b> Protein characterization was performed by BCA, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as presented in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>. The total protein separation by polyacrylamide gel showed that the major groups of milk proteins, including caseins and whey proteins, were present post-GUC at high levels in the SM_NT samples and to a lesser extent in IMF_NT samples (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>A), while pre-treatment with AA or IP quite efficiently removed caseins. Post-DUC, the SM_NT and IMF_NT had strong bands representing caseins and whey proteins and AA and IP pre-treatment efficiently removed these proteins. Therefore, AA and IP samples, especially those generated by GUC were termed as EV enriched fractions, whereas NT or those generated by DUC were termed as crude samples.</p>

<p>(A) Milk proteins were visualized on 10% acrylamide gels. Efforts to remove milk proteins were performed by acetic acid (AA) and isoelectric precipitation (IP) and the resulting whey was used for either GUC or DUC.

<p>(B) Immunoblotting of SM and infant milk formula (IMF) EVs separated using GUC and DUC and their densitometric analysis. An equal amount of protein (35 μg) was loaded for all the samples and analyzed for TSG101, CD63 and Actinin 4. Figure reprinted with permission from <a href="#bib3">Mukhopadhya et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<p>In line with MISEV2018 guidelines (<a href="#bib5">Thery et al., 2018</a>), immunoblotting was performed on lysed samples for two EV positive markers, TSG101 and CD63, and a negative marker Actinin 4 and a representative blot presented in <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>B. The GUC generated SM_NT, SM_AA and SM_IP samples were typically positive for both TSG101 and CD63, but not Actinin 4. Although equal quantities of protein were loaded, TSG101 and CD63 were always at higher levels in SM-derived compared to IMF-derived samples and Actinin 4 was undetected in all EV samples. In post-DUC samples, no signal for Actinin 4 was observed for either SM or IMF. Again, SM_NT, SM_AA and SM_IP samples were positive for both TSG101 and CD63. IMF_NT samples compared to SM_NT had faint TSG101 and CD63 signals. Unlike SM_AA and SM_IP samples, neither IMF_AA nor IMF_IP samples showed bands for either TSG101 or CD63.</p>
<p><b>Particle characterization:</b> The size and concentration of EVs separated from SM and IMF samples were analyzed by NTA and observed data presented in <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>A and mean of size and yield in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. Considering size distribution, post-GUC particles from the SM (SM_NT, SM_AA and SM_IP) samples were 156.13±5.87 nm and from IMF (IMF_NT, IMF_AA and IMF_IP) samples were 159.90±12.96 nm. Post-DUC of SM (SM_NT_200 K, SM_AA_200 K and SM_IP_200 K) were 159.10±5.27 nm and IMF (IMF_NT_200 K, IMF_AA_200 K and IMF_IP_200 K) were 175.73±8.44 nm. No significant differences were observed between the EV sizes of SM and IMF, separated by GUC or DUC.</p>

<p>As presented in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> (i), post-GUC, the concentration of EVs in SM_NT samples was higher (7.10-fold; P=0.05) compared with IMF_NT samples. Similarly, the EV concentration of SM_IP samples was significantly higher (6.71-fold; P=0.01) when compared with IMF_IP samples. In turn, the concentration in SM_AA samples was substantially higher (4.93-fold) than in IMF_AA, although not significantly different (P=0.26) as a result of quite large differences in biological repeat SM_AA values (i.e., a large error bar).</p>
<p>Similarly, post-DUC -as presented in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> (ii)- the EV/particle concentration in SM_NT_200 K samples was significantly higher (423.66-fold; P=0.04) than in IMF_NT_200 K. Likewise, the EV/particle concentration in SM_AA_200 K samples was 16.45-fold higher (P=0.03) compared to that in IMF_AA_200 K and the SM_IP_200 K samples had 7.83-fold more particles (P=0.01) when compared to the IMF_IP_200 K samples.</p>
<p>Complementary information was obtained by TEM and presented in <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>B. Following GUC separation, the SM EVs (SM_NT, SM_AA and SM_IP) appeared intact with limited background debris. IMF-derived EVs appeared more diffuse with less smooth surfaces, and with much more debris in the background. Post-DUC, SM EVs samples (SM_NT, SM_AA and SM_IP) multiple smaller vesicles were observed, although sometimes in clumps (arrows, <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>B). The IMF samples (IMF_NT, IMF_AA and IMF_IP) had very few EV-like structures, but much more background debris.</p>
<p><b>Imaging flow cytometry analysis:</b> The analysis of intact EVs based on the presence of EV surface markers CD9, CD63, CD81, ADAM10 and HLADR was performed using imaging flow cytometry (IFCM) and the gating strategy, representative images and observed data is presented in <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>. The data from crude samples generated by post-DUC are not presented here but have been reported in <a href="#bib3">Mukhopadhya et al. (2021)</a>. In post-GUC samples, significant differences in the +EVs/mL of sample for EV-specific markers (CD63, CD9, CD81, ADAM10 and HLADR) were observed, and where there was a difference in the surface marker, the levels were always higher with the SM EV compared to the IMF EVs. It is also interesting to note that there were no differences observed between non-treated vs. acid-treated samples. This indicates that although there are casein micelles present in these milk EV fractions, the antibodies used for our IFCM analysis only bind to the EVs without non-specific binding. Hence, only the EVs are detected by IFCM and micelles and protein aggregates are undetected by this technique (unlike NTA which accesses particles but cannot decipher EVs from other particles).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Comparing the centrifugations steps: while the GUC itself requires approximately 18 h for centrifugation, the DUC requires approximately only 6.25 h. DUC can accommodate a larger volume of samples (38 mL) compared to GUC, which can only accommodate 2.3 mL per sample. However, it is interesting to note that although DUC is a quicker technique, samples generated post-GUC were more suitable for downstream analysis.</p>
<p>For GUC, the pellets generated post IP and AA treatment of SM and GUC were characterized by all the techniques and were highly suitable, whereas the pellets generated post-NT was not suitable to be analyzed by IFCM as a high number of casein micelles may lead to clogging of the capillary tubes. Compared to SM, IMF pellets generated by GUC post IP and AA were also suitable for all characterization techniques, although very few and disrupted EVs were identified. No intact EV like structures were identified with TEM in IMF_IP samples. In both NT samples from SM and IMF, generated post-GUC, one limitation seems to be the high amount of milk proteins present. Since these proteins, especially caseins, tend to form micelles, they are not the best samples to use in techniques that use light diffraction. On contrary, AA and IP treatment are highly suitable, as they efficiently remove milk proteins, thus increasing the chance to separate pure EVs. However, immunoblotting seems to be the best technique for all the samples, as the binding of the antibodies to the EV markers are specific and reliable data is generated from this technique.</p>
<p>For DUC generated pellets, for both SM and IMF, the major limitation is the presence of a high amount of contaminating proteins, such as caseins. Especially for the NT samples, the presence of casein and whey milk proteins was confirmed in every pellet collected after each centrifugation step, rendering most of these samples unsuitable for further characterization, apart from immunoblotting. Although the AA and IP treatments removed milk proteins, visualized by SDS-PAGE, the characterization of the pellets generated post-DUC was difficult. For instance, with TEM, a high amount of debris was observed with most of the samples, making it difficult to identify EV structures. Similarly, using these samples for flow cytometric analysis was difficult and only the 200 K samples were analyzed. Again, as mentioned above, immunoblotting is the technique of choice here as this technique helps in identifying the presence of EV markers efficiently. Although, one point of concern is the trapping of EVs within the casein micelles and getting precipitated at a lower ultracentrifugation speed compared to the actual speed where EVs should be precipitated.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Milk preparation issues (step 1)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If using liquid milk, users should ensure that any free fat, milk solids, protein aggregates are removed from the milk before proceeding with EV separation. If using raw milk, we have detailed additional steps to be followed in step 1.</p>
<p>In case raw milk is being stored for further EV separation, the defatting and removal of milk solids, protein aggregates and free cells should be performed before storage of milk at −80°C.</p>
<p>Spray-dried milk can be used, as demonstrated in the current protocol. However, as the manufacturer’s recommendations to reconstitute spray-dried milk vary, users should ensure that the milk powder is dissolved and then proceed with the protocol.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Sufficient casein removal (step 5 or 9)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We have demonstrated that the separation of highly enriched EV fractions from milk involved casein protein removal. Insufficient removal of casein may lead to blockage of filters (step 5 or 9) or during downstream analysis. Hence, care should be taken during the centrifugation step and filtration step post-acid treatment to ensure that the casein pellet is not disturbed.</p>
<p>It is also essential to keep the pH as close as possible to 4.6. In case the pH is higher than 4.6, it will not precipitate the casein completely whereas if the pH is highly acidic, this may affect the EVs.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Low yield of EVs (steps 4 to 9)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Milk should be brought to room temperature before applying this protocol. Using frozen or hot milk may lead to the formation of crystals or foam, respectively, further hindering the filtration process (steps 5 or 9).</p>
<p>It is essential to bring the pH of the milk to 4.6 for efficient precipitation of casein. Issues with pH meter or filtration steps may lead to contamination of milk whey with casein (steps 4 or 7).</p>
<p>Collection of 1 mL fraction post-GUC should be performed with utmost care to not disturb layers in order to not lose the EV enriched fractions.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Collapsing of tubes during ultracentrifugation (steps 18 and 28)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>For steps 18 and 28, the ultracentrifuge related instructions should be strictly followed. In case tubes are not filled up to the maximum volume, there is a higher chance of tubes collapsing leading to loss of samples as well as negatively affecting the ultracentrifuge rotor.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Choice of techniques to quantify EV concentration (steps for post-separation quantification)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Based on the data presented in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>, it may seem that there is a loss of EVs in the acid-treated sample compared to non-treated milk samples. However, this reflects the limitations of the technique (nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)) rather than the actual loss of EVs. While NTA technique is highly preferred and frequently used technique to characterize particle concentrations within a sample, it does not differentiate between EVs, protein aggregates, or any other particle type (&gt; approximately 30 nm) that may be present. Hence, complementary characterization techniques should be used to fully characterize the samples. Interestingly, we do see a decrease in EV concentration between non-treated vs. acid-treated samples, this reflects the removal of casein micelles (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>B) rather than loss of EVs.</p>
