<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this protocol, we provide step-by-step instructions for dissection and culture of primary murine dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which provide an opportunity to study the functional properties of peripheral sensory neurons <i>in vitro</i>. Further, we describe the analysis of neuropeptide release by ELISA as a possible downstream application. In addition, isolated DRGs can be used directly for immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, RNA sequencing or proteomic approaches, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib4">Perner et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Day 1: Dissection of vertebral column</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5–10 min per mouse</div>
<p>Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) are located in the intervertebral foramen adjacent to the spinal cord. It is therefore necessary to dissect the vertebral column before isolating the DRG. To decrease blood contamination, animals can be perfused with PBS prior to the dissection of the vertebral column.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the perfusion syringe by adapting an 18G needle to a 10 mL syringe and aspirate 1× PBS. You can use one syringe for several mice.</li>
<li>Prepare 1 × 50 mL Falcon tube for the collection of the vertebral column.
<ol type="a">
<li>Fill the 50 mL Falcon with 20 mL of supplemented HBSS solution.</li>

<li>After the mouse is sacrificed, lay the mouse on the dissection board in a supine position. Pin feet down with a needle for stabilization. Spray 70% ethanol on the fur of the mouse. Open the chest and expose the heart for perfusion. (<a href="#mmc1">Methods Video S1</a>)<br>
<ol type="a">
<li>Use the forceps to pick up the skin around the bottom of the sternum (the highest point of the mouse chest when lying in a supine position). Make an incision using a pair of scissors.</li>
<li>Lift the bottom of the sternum with the forceps and cut along the diaphragm using the scissors. To avoid damage of the heart or lung, hold the forceps high and keep the tip of the scissor tip pointed ventrally, just under the sternum and the ribs.</li>
<li>Lift the rib cage and expose the heart. You can cut out a little window of the sternum and the ribs to have a better view on the right atrium of the heart.</li>
<li>Make an incision on the right atrium (deep red color compared to light red color of the ventricles) so the blood and perfusion buffer (PBS) can escape.</li>
<li>Use forceps to carefully hold the heart, then pierce the heart at the left apex into the left ventricle using the perfusion syringe. Perfuse with 2–4 mL room temperature PBS.</li>

<h3 id="sec3.2">DRG dissection</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15–30 min per mouse</div>
<p>The DRG dissection is the trickiest part of this protocol and it needs some practice. For this step you need a stereomicroscope.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Open the vertebral column to remove the spinal cord and gain access to the DRG
<ol type="a">
<li>Once the vertebral column is cleared from the surrounding soft tissue and ribs, take a small micro-dissection scissor and put one scissor tip into the caudal spinal canal. Now carefully cut in the sagittal plane one vertebra at a time in cranial direction until the vertebral column is half opened. The easiest way is to hold the vertebral column with your fingers, so you have the best control over where you cut. Make sure the cut is in the middle of the vertebrae, as this will allow the best access to the DRG. (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>)

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 2. Cutting the vertebral column sagittal in half and removal of the spinal cord</div>
<p>(A) Dorsal view of vertebral column cleaned from all soft tissue and attached ribs. Vertebral proccessi spinosi and vertebral arcs are visible. The cut must be made exactly through processi spinosi in a sagittal approach from caudal to cranial.</p>
<p>(B) Vertebral column split in half, view into the spinal canal with the remaining spinal cord on both sides.</p>
<p>(C) View into the spinal canal after removal of the spinal cord. Intervertebral foramina and DRG are visible. Scale bar: 1 cm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Now turn the vertebral column and cut through the opposite side again from caudal to cranial, one processus spinosus vertebrae at a time in a sagittal direction.</li>
<li>Now the vertebral column is split in half along the sagittal plane. Take a petri dish filled with supplemented HBSS. Lay down both half pieces so the spinal cord is visible. Take one tweezer to hold the vertebral column down and one tweezer to grasp the cranial aspect of the spinal cord and pull it out from cranial to caudal. Do this with both half pieces. Be careful not to pull too hard on the spinal roots, so the DRGs do not get pulled out. Put the petri dish with the two half pieces of the vertebral column on ice.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> These steps can be performed with or without using the stereomicroscope. This is personal preference. (<a href="#mmc4">Methods Video S4</a>)</div>

<li>Picking the DRG
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> These steps should be performed using a stereomicroscope.</div>
<ol type="a">
<li>The DRG are located in the intervertebral foramina connected to the spinal cord through the dorsal root but separated through the meninges.</li>
<li>Prepare a 15 mL Falcon containing 15 mL supplemented DMEM media and keep it on ice, open the lid so you can easily put the DRG in the media.</li>
<li>Take one half of the vertebral column from the Petri dish and leave the other in the HBSS on ice while you dissect the DRG from the first half.</li>
<li>To adequately visualize the DRG, pin down one half of the vertebral column (e.g., using a Styr pore pin pad) so that the spinal canal is facing up. Now you are able to see the DRG in the intervertebral foramen beneath a shiny layer of meninges. Sometimes it is not easy to see them shine through. Especially in the beginning it is also helpful to use your tweezers to feel the openings between bony vertebrae where the foramina are and in which the DRG are located.</li>
<li>Take a fine tweezer in one hand and a fine spring scissor in the other hand. Now feel that there are the bony vertebral arcs, and between them there is a soft hole, that is the intervertebral foramen. Take the tweezer and push with slightly opened ends into the foramen and take the DRG between the tweezer endings.</li>
<li>Tightly grasp the dorsal and ventral axon roots close to the DRG using your tweezers. Carefully pull it up a few millimeters, maintaining a tight grasp with your tweezers. (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>)

Take the DRG out of the PFA using a tweezer and put them into 15% sucrose solution (15 g sucrose in 100 mL PBS) into a new Eppendorf tube for 24 h at 4°C. After that, take the DRG out and put them into 30% sucrose solution (30 g sucrose in 100 mL PBS) and store at 4°C for at least 24 h or for longer time periods until you want to perform cryostat cutting. Prior to cryostat sectioning, first place the DRG in OCT and keep for at least 18 h or longer time periods at −80°C.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>From one adult mouse it is expected to get around 40,000 to 60,000 sensory neurons if you collect around 30 DRG. Therefore, we recommend plating no more than 20 wells per mouse (2,500–3,000 sensory neurons per well). Under the tissue culture microscope you will be able to see the round sensory neuron cell bodies that appear like a luminous oval. You will see some glial and axon debris as well, but this will not attach to the bottom of the well and instead will float in or on top of the media. By changing the media on day 2, much of the debris will be removed with the media. (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>)</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The protocol describes the dissection of DRGs from the whole accessible spine of a mouse. It does not describe the dissection of the DRG from certain spinal segments that might be needed for studies on peripheral nerves (e.g., sciatic nerve) (<a href="#bib2">Kalinski et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib6">Swett et al., 1991</a>). Also, there is no description of the dissection of the trigeminal ganglion provided (<a href="#bib3">Katzenell et al., 2017</a>), which contains the cell bodies of the sensory neurons that innervate the head and face. Furthermore, we provide the description to culture murine sensory neurons that are not sorted from glial cells and the few immune cells that are part of the DRG. Adding Ara-C to the neurobasal culture medium will decrease glial cell proliferation.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The process of cutting the vertebral column sagittal in half requires concentration and fine handling. By cutting too much to one side of the vertebral arc, it is possible to cut too close to the DRG which makes it very hard or impossible to pick them afterwards (step 7).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure you cut right in the middle of the processus spinosus of the vertebrae. Try different scissors. A fine micro dissection scissor or a fine spring scissor (a bit larger than the spring scissor you need for the step where you pick the DRG). Alternatively, you can cut the column in 3 pieces, place the column piece by piece dorsal side facing up and secure it with thick forceps. Now use a raiser plate to cut the column sagittal in half (<a href="#bib5">Sleigh et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>It is often the case that after carefully removing the spinal cord, there will be some residuals of the spinal cord and of the ventral and dorsal roots that can make it harder to see and locate the DRG (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The ventral and dorsal roots as well as the spinal cord are whiter in color, which helps to distinguish them from DRGs and allows to remove them carefully if they are hiding the view on the intervertebral foramina. To find the DRG within the tissue and the handling of the dissection tools requires some training if not done frequently. That should be considered before planning the experiment.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Digestion of DRG must be balanced between separating the sensory neurons from the surrounding tissue without harming the neurons through the digestion itself (step 13).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The 70 min we propose in this protocol is on the longer time edge on what we would recommend for the digestion and a time frame that works in our lab. Nevertheless, we have found that this time varies in different labs working with DRG culture between 15–30 min up to 90 min. This is probably depending on the enzymatic activity and concentration of the Collagenase A/Dispase II mix used.</p>
<p>If you find yourself having troubles with the viability of your cultured DRG neurons we recommend to titrate the time down.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Counting sensory neurons before plating may be necessary if you have different mouse lines or conditions to compare. Because of the rough digestion process and the trituration, you will find a lot of debris in your cytometer field of view so it can be hard to see the actual sensory neuron cell bodies (step 18).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To make sure that the counting is reliably working, we recommend taking a cytometer (e.g., Neubauer chamber) undiluted, or with a maximum dilution of 1:1 with Trypan blue. This should allow you to find enough sensory neuron cell bodies in the four quadrants of the Neubauer chamber. You will see a lot of small round cells and debris as well as worm like structures. These are not the neuron cell bodies. The neuron cell bodies are large round cells, approximately 5× the size of a leucocyte. Only count these cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>During the process of changing the media, it is possible that some sensory neurons might float off, leading to the loss of sensory neurons, which can affect your experiment (step 29).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If you have plated your cells in the center of a 24 well plate well, remove the media very slowly and carefully by tipping the plate and putting the pipette tip in the bottom rim of the well.</p>
<p>If you have plated your cells in the lower edge of 96 well plate wells, remove the media very slowly and carefully by tipping the plate and putting the pipette tip in the upper rim opposite of the neurons.</p>
<p>Carefully fill the wells with new media by slowly rinsing out down the wall of the well.</p>
