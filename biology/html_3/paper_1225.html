<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We describe a protocol for identifying cellular thiol metabolites such as cysteine and cystine in adherent cells using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tandem mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. We applied a modified extraction and sample derivatization protocol to accurately quantify the intracellular levels of labile thiol species and to inhibit oxidation prior to analysis.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00683-3/sref8">Liu et al.

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Several analytical approaches have been developed to quantify thiols in biological samples such as combining high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) with ultraviolet (UV) detection (<a href="#bib7">Kuśmierek et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib12">Toyo’oka 2009</a>) , fluorescence detection (<a href="#bib10">McMenamin et al. 2009</a>; <a href="#bib1">Carlucci and Tabucchi 2009</a>) and electrochemical detection (<a href="#bib11">Sporea et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#bib3">Inoue and Kirchhoff 2002</a>) . However, these methods typically employ uncommon or customized equipment, toxic or otherwise difficult reagents, and may require complete reduction of disulfide bonds prior to analysis and so will not preserve information about thiol-disulfide ratios. This protocol uses a liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platform to perform a quantitative analysis of thiol metabolite species (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), such as glutathione (GSH), cystine, cysteine, γ-glutamylcystine, glutathionylcysteine, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), from cultured cell lines.</p>
<figure id="fig1"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1225-Fig1.jpg" alt="Fig1.jpg">

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Metabolism of cystine and cystine-derived metabolites. Schematic shows cystine uptake via SLC7A11</div>
<p>Imported cystine is reduced to cysteine by utilizing NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Cysteine is used to synthesize glutathione by combining with glutamate and glycine (shown in the green background). Intracellular cystine can combine with other molecules such as γ-glutamylcysteine (an intermediate of the glutathione pathway) to form γ-glutamylcystine; similarly, cystine can also donate one cysteine to combine with glutathione to form glutathionylcysteiene (shown in the left red background). In addition, these metabolites can be linked to proteins via disulfide bonds (shown in the right red background).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cell line selection is a critical factor that will determine the success of this experiment as abundance of intracellular metabolites is significantly influenced by expression levels of specific nutrient transporters and/or metabolic enzymes. For instance, SLC7A11<sup>high</sup> cancer cell lines generally exhibit high levels of intracellular cysteine and/or glutathione due to increased cystine uptake (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). In this protocol, we primarily used the UMRC6 cell line, which has high SLC7A11 expression (<a href="#bib6">Koppula et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib8">Liu et al., 2020</a>).</p>

In this case you can optimize the quantitative ranges by running the standard curves at two different injection volumes, such as 1 and 20 μL.

<p>Solvent A can be prepared and stored directly in the 4 L amber glass bottle that the LC-MS-grade water is stored in. Remove 12.9 mL of water from the bottle, add the tributylamine and acetic acid, and place a clean stir bar in the bottle. Mix the solution by vigorously stirring for at least 1 h.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> tributylamine readily adsorbs to the interior surfaces of the HPLC apparatus (tubing, valves, etc.) and can be difficult to fully remove except with extensive washing. While this does not pose an issue with HPLC-MS analyses in negative ionization mode, the strong propensity of tributylamine to form positive ions in solution tends to result in persistent background signal when run in positive ionization mode. Therefore this method should only be employed on an HPLC platform dedicated to negative-mode analyses or one that can be subject to extensive washing prior to positive mode analysis. An example wash protocol is to flow a solution of 0.1% formic acid in 50% methanol / 50% water through the HPLC system at 20 μL/in for 24–48 h.</div>

<p>The flow rate is set to 0.2 mL/min for the duration of the run. The column oven temperature is set to 40°C. These conditions typically result in a maximum backpressure of 200–220 bars, with pressures in excess of 275 bar indicating a clog in the solvent line. The method can be run at 25°C, without a solvent oven, but this will result in higher baseline pressure readings and may lead to variability in retention times.</p>

<p>An overview of the procedure is summarized in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. The cells are plated on Day 1 (Step 1). The samples for thiol analyses are extracted from the cells on Day 2 (steps 2–4). The samples may be stored at this point, and are spiked with internal standards, derivatized and analyzed on Day 3.</p>

<li>Plate 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> UMRC6 cells in a 35 mm dish at a density that will ensure ∼70–80% confluence at the time of extraction.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We recommend using dialyzed FBS-containing medium for all the relevant steps in this protocol, as this allows better control of the metabolite levels the cells are exposed to during growth and treatment phases.

<li>Spin the tubes (5 min, 5000 × <i>g</i>, 4 C).</li>
<li>Transfer the supernatants into new, labeled 2 mL tubes on ice.</li>
<li>The samples can be stored at this point at −80°C for a maximum of 48 h. The samples need to be on dry ice if they need to be shipped. Note these extracts will freeze on ice.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec3.5">Day 3: Sample derivatization</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 0.5–1 h</div>
<ol start="21">
<li>If the samples are frozen, thaw them on ice or on a cold block at ice-cold temperatures. Alternatively, you can proceed directly to this step from sample collection. Also thaw one or more aliquots of <i>internal standard solution</i> on ice (10 μL per sample to be analyzed).</li>

<h3 id="sec3.6">Sample analysis by LC-MS</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 0.5–1 h per sample</div>
<p>The derivatized samples are analyzed by LC-MS. The method detailed here uses reversed-phase chromatography with a C18 column and tributylamine as an ion-pairing reagent with an Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer, but other column chemistries and mass spectrometers can be used as well. In that case you will need to develop the chromatography method and confirm separation and detection with standard solutions.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Prepare mobile phase <i>Solvent A</i> as described in the “<a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>” section.</li>

<li>Calibrate the mass spectrometer using <i>negative ion calibration solution</i> according to the manufacturer’s instruction.</li>
<li>Set up the sequence to run your samples, using the injection volumes determined in the <i>Standard curve</i> section. Run at least one blank first to ensure the LC column is fully conditioned, and to establish baseline values.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> due to the large difference in intracellular concentrations between some of these analytes, you may need to run each sample twice, with two different injection volumes, to ensure that all the analytes are within the linear range of the mass spectrometer.</div>

<li>Open the mzXML files in the El-MAVEN software package.</li>
<li>Find the peaks for the analytes of interest and their respective internal standards, and extract the peak area values to a comma-separated values (∗.csv) file.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec3.7">Data analysis and quantitation</h3>
<ol start="38">
<li>For each sample, determine the ratio of the unlabeled analyte peak to that of the isotope-labeled internal standard peak in that same sample.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> if you had to run each sample twice, with different injection volumes, be sure to use only the data from the run with signals in the linear range.</div>
<ol start="39">
<li>Using the standard curve data from the <i>Standard curves</i> section, convert each ratio to a molar concentration. This is the concentration of the analyte in the extract.</li>

</ol>
<p class="chem">C<sub>cell</sub> = C<sub>extract</sub> × 500 × PCV</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Based on this protocol described above, we have successfully conducted thiol analysis in our recent publications (<a href="#bib8">Liu et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib5">Koppula et al., 2021</a>). The RSD/CV for these analytes are typically below 15% for biological replicates, and under 5% for technical replicates. For example, we showed that glucose starvation, by limiting the supply of intracellular NADPH (through the pentose phosphate pathway) for cystine reduction, markedly increased intracellular cystine concentrations in UMRC6 cells (a SLC7A11<sup>high</sup> cell line); likewise, treatment of UMRC6 cells with GLUT inhibitor KL-11743 also significantly increased intracellular cystine levels, although cystine accumulation by KL-11743 was less potent than that by glucose starvation (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A). It should be noted that glucose starvation or GLUT inhibitor treatment typically did not cause a corresponding decrease of intracellular cysteine levels (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B), likely because cysteine utilization for protein synthesis is also dramatically suppressed under glucose starvation (which is known to inhibit mTORC1 signaling). Our methods also revealed that glucose starvation or KL-11743 treatment significantly increased intracellular levels of other disulfide molecules such as GSSG, glutamyl-cystine, glutathionyl-cysteine, with a concomitant decrease of intracellular GSH levels (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>C–3F). We further showed that these thiol level changes caused by glucose starvation or GLUT inhibition are dependent on high SLC7A11 expression in UMRC6 cells (data not shown). Together, using these methods, we demonstrate that, in SLC7A11<sup>high</sup> cancer cells, high rates of cystine import and subsequent cystine reduction to cysteine promote glucose dependency due to high NADPH demand; consequently, limiting glucose supply (by either glucose starvation or GLUT inhibitor treatment) restrains cystine reduction to cysteine, resulting in marked accumulation of cystine and other disulfide molecules. (In studies described above, the relative standard deviations for these analytes were typically below 15% for biological replicates, and under 5% for technical replicates.) Another recent study revealed similar results (<a href="#bib4">Joly et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Low cell number may lead to output lower than detection range. Since this method calculates intracellular concentrations using the total cell volume, but only a fraction of that volume consists of water, these concentrations will not strictly reflect the concentration of the analyte in solution. For example, common estimates for mammalian cells suggest that water constitutes 70% of the volume of the cytosol, which itself is approximately 70% of the total cell volume. Since the aqueous fraction of volume varies between cell types, and is difficult to determine experimentally, we use the total cell volume as an approximation that is not likely to differ from the aqueous volume by much more than a factor of two. The whole-cell extracts result in the mixing of intracellular compartments and so do not allow for organelle-specific concentrations to be determined. However, this technique could be adapted to measure thiol and disulfide concentrations in isolated organelles (<a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>No difference in positive and negative controls (<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step by step method details</a>, step 2–3).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is possible that the cell density at the time of collection was too high. This creates an environment where the cells are competing with each other for resources. It is possible that the pre-treatment with media wasn’t done properly to restore depleted nutrients. It is possible that the cell line was with low-expression of SLC7A11/SLC3A2 or was with wild-type KEAP1 gene if significant accumulation of cystine or GSSG weren’t shown upon glucose starvation. For more detail, please refer to our recent publications (<a href="#bib8">Liu et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib5">Koppula et al., 2021</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Too much variation in signals from intra-assay replicates of the same sample (<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step by step method details</a>, step 2–20).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is possible that the seeding wasn’t consistent between the replicates. If treating the cells to a chemical agent such as a drug, please make sure to use that same working stock solution. Make sure to perform the relevant steps as recommended to maintain the samples at ambient temperatures to avoid sample degradation.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>High- or low-pressure error when attempting to run the LC system (<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step by step method details</a>, step 30–37).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A high-pressure error indicates that there is a clog somewhere in the solvent line between the LC pump and the ESI source. Locate the clog by disconnecting each individual section of tubing, in series, while continuing to pump solvent (be sure to collect the solvent in a waste container). After disconnecting each section, monitor the pressure to see if it is above baseline. If not, reconnect the tubing and move on to the next section. Once you have found the location of the clog you will need to remove it either by cleaning the clogged piece of the pump or replacing the piece/tubing. A low-pressure error indicates a leak somewhere in the solvent line between the LC pump and the ESI source. Inspect the entire solvent line for liquid residue to find the leak. Replace any damaged tubing or equipment and tighten any loose fittings to stop the leak.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>No signal detected, even for the internal standards (Step by Step method details, step 37).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure to perform the relevant steps as recommended to maintain the samples and avoid sample degradation. Examine the HPLC-MS platform to ensure that it is operating properly. Check for leaks in the sample flow line and confirm that the liquid flow is reaching the ion source. Directly infuse calibration standard mixture into the MS and confirm that the signals are within normal ranges. If the problem persists, contact tech support.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>One or more analytes give signals outside the linear range of the assay (<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step by step method details</a>, step 38–40).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the signals are too low, try to extract a larger volume of cells. If the signals are too high, either extract a lower volume of cells or dilute the extracts in the extraction solution.</p>
