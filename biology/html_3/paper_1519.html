<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Transmission via fomites poses a major dissemination route for many human pathogens, particularly because of transfer via fingertips. Here, we present a protocol to investigate direct transfer of infectious agents from fomites to humans via naked fingertips. The protocol is suitable for pathogens requiring highest biosafety levels (e.g., SARS-CoV-2). We used an artificial skin to touch a defined volume of virus suspension and subsequent quantification of infectious entities allows quantitative measurement of transfer efficiency and risk assessment.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Pathogen contaminants can be transmitted directly (i.e., respiratory droplets, hand-to-hand contact) or indirectly via contaminated surfaces (fomites) (<a href="#bib3">Leung, 2021</a>). In particular, frequently touched objects can serve as vehicles for transferring different clinically relevant pathogens. Banknotes and coins offer sample surface area and are frequently exchanged between individuals. As a result, numerous concerns have been raised, that banknotes and coins serve as vectors for the transmission of disease-causing microorganisms. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, it was suspected that contaminated banknotes and coins contributed to the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in a sharp decline in the use of cash (<a href="#bib6">Tamele et al., 2021</a>).</p>
<p>Although under controlled laboratory conditions, most pathogens are able to survive on different surfaces for a certain time frame (<a href="#bib9">Wißmann et al., 2021</a>), these measurements do not per se imply that a given surface can act as source of pathogen transmission if no disinfection is performed. In order to adequately assess the risk of transmission for a given pathogen and determine appropriate hygiene measures, detailed information about its survival on different surfaces and its ability to spread via contact with other surfaces is needed. In addition, the transfer efficiency is further determined by a combination of different parameters, including viral loads, virus species, and fomite material, requiring comprehensive measurements. However, for pathogens requiring high levels of biosafety (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and permitting certain measurements (e.g., direct transfer of infectious agents from one specimen to another), comprehensive measurements and experimental settings similar to real-life conditions are notoriously difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>We recently implemented a new study protocol to quantitatively assess the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 between fomites and fingertips (<a href="#bib7">Todt et al., 2021</a>). To simulate the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 and different means of payment, we inoculated banknotes and coins as well as stainless steel carriers with SARS-CoV-2 and recovered infectious virus by printing or rubbing an artificial skin fabric over the sample surface. The amount of recovered infectious virus was subsequently determined by an end-point dilution assay given in 50% tissue culture infectious dose per milliliter (TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL). Based on different surfaces, initial virus titers, and application to fomites (wet or dry inoculum), our findings suggest a relatively low risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by contaminated coins and banknotes (<a href="#bib7">Todt et al., 2021</a>).</p>
<p>While our protocol, as described below, was initially developed to test whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from banknotes and coins to fingertips, it can easily be adapted to other highly pathogenic viruses under BSL3 biosafety precautions and/or scenarios of transmission.</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Following the experimental setup described here, it is possible to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission from different fomites to skin. However, this protocol can easily be adopted to other viruses by adjusting the cell line and/or read out or modified to study skin-to-skin transmission and other scenarios of transmission. Depending on initial viral titers a significant amount of virus can be transferred and subsequently recovered from the VITRO Skin®, which helps to calculate the risk of transmission by contact to contaminated surfaces. Indeed, frequently touched objects have been suspected to serve as vehicles for certain pathogens such as bacteria, parasites, fungi, and viruses including SARS-CoV-2 (<a href="#bib1">Angelakis et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib4">Pal and Bhadada, 2020</a>). Therefore, data providing information about transmission efficacy can play an important rule when adjusting hygiene measures.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec4.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>After recovery of residual virus from the VITRO Skin®, no CPE can be observed on the target cells (step 22).</p>
<h3 id="sec4.2">Potential solution 1</h3>
<p>The lower limit of detection for end-point-dilution assays is higher compared to the more sensitive PCR, thus high viral loads of the initial virus stock are required to get a sufficient measurement window. When repeating the experiment, a virus stock with a higher titre should be used for the touch-transfer.</p>
<h3 id="sec4.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>After recovery of residual virus from the VITRO Skin®, all wells in every dilution show CPE (step 22).</p>
<h3 id="sec4.4">Potential solution 2</h3>
<p>End-point dilution assays have distinct measurement windows, which may be exceeded when viral loads go beyond 10<sup>8</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL. In this case the 2 mL DMEM w/o FCS from step 13 (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D) should be pre-diluted.</p>
<h3 id="sec4.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>High variability between biological replicates is observed (step 22).</p>
<h3 id="sec4.6">Potential solution 3</h3>
<p>Viruses are sensitive to humidity and temperature. Make sure to conduct experiments under controlled environmental conditions to avoid increased/decreased desiccation and stability.</p>
<h3 id="sec4.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Dehydration of VITRO Skin® (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec4.8">Potential solution 4</h3>
<p>The hydrated VITRO Skin® should be stored in humid chambers to avoid dehydration. The best way to keep the skin hydrated is to add a wet tissue to the petri dish and only open the lid if necessary. Additionally, pay attention to not place the petri dish in the air flow of the work bench.</p>
<h3 id="sec4.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The VITRO Skin® disrupts when handled or hinged/unhinged from the frame (step 12 and 13).</p>
<h3 id="sec4.10">Potential solution 5</h3>
<p>The handling of the VITRO Skin® can sometimes be difficult, especially when hydrated as it becomes softer and at the same time more fragile. This can cause the artificial skin to disrupt. Therefore, users are advised to practice the handling of the skin and the frame.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>Residual infectious viral titers were calculated according to Spearman and Kerber (<a href="#bib5">Spearman, 1908</a>; <a href="#bib2">Kaerber, 1931</a>). The lower limit of detection is set to 158 TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL, given by the prerequisites for validity of this method, i.e., all wells are positive in the lowest dilution, while all other wells are negative (<a href="#bib8">Vieyres and Pietschmann, 2013</a>). A pre-filled Excel sheet for the TCID<sub>50</sub> calculation can be freely accessed at <a href="https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/en/zentrum-fuer-infektiologie/molecular-virology/welcome/downloads">https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/en/zentrum-fuer-infektiologie/molecular-virology/welcome/downloads</a> (courtesy of Marco Binder, Heidelberg)</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Detection of residual viral titres should rely on the quantification of the infectious dose such as the calculation of the TCID<sub>50</sub>, as the determination of viral loads by quantitative PCR does not provide information about infectiousness. However, the limit of detection for end-point-dilution assays is higher compared to the more sensitive PCR, thus high viral loads of the initial virus stock are required to get a sufficient measurement window.</p>
