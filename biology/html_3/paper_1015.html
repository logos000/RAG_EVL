<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We recently characterized the association between DNA damage and immunoresponse <i>in vivo</i> in colonic mucosa of mice infected with a <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium strain expressing a genotoxin, known as typhoid toxin. In this protocol, we describe how to assess the extent and features of infiltrating macrophages by double immunofluorescence. Total macrophage population was determined using an F4/80 antibody, whereas the specific M2-like population was assessed using a CD206 antibody.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.108931">Martin et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 days</div>
<ol>
<li>During the necropsies, colons have been collected and prepared for histology following the Swiss-roll technique by rolling up the intestine lengthwise. The colon is removed from the abdomen and cleaned with 1<b>×</b> PBS (no Mg<sup>2+</sup>, no Ca<sup>2+</sup>) from the colonic content. The colon is rolled up longitudinally with the help of a toothpick from the distal to the proximal end (<a href="#bib2">Moolenbeek and Ruitenberg, 1981</a>). Immediately insert the rolled colon in a cryo-mold containing cryo-embedding medium (OCT). Then, cover completely the tissue by adding more OCT. The cryo-mold should be placed immediately on dry ice. Frozen tissue blocks can be stored at −80°C, for long-term storage or prior sectioning.</li>
<li>The tissue sectioning is performed using a Cryostat at the temperature of −20°C.</li>
<li>Cut sections at 10 μm thickness and mount them onto SUPERFROST® PLUS Microscope Adhesion Slides (positively charged).</li>
<li>Keep the sections for 1 h on dry ice to retain tissue adherence and store slides at −80°C until usage.</li>
</ol>
<p>The protocol below describes the specific steps for immunofluorescence (IF) on colon. However, it can be used also for other tissues (e.g., spleen, liver). This protocol has been done in fresh frozen tissues and its application to Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) might require further optimization.</p>

<p>The described method allows a straightforward staining and quantification of total and M2-macrophages in colonic murine tissues in order to assess the intestinal immunological environment. As expected, staining of M2-like macrophages (CD206-positive cells) must co-localize with F4/80 staining and both stainings must be localized at the cell membrane.</p>

<p>Both F4/80 and CD206 stainings must be located at the cell membrane and any hints of nuclear staining should not be considered as positive (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Manual quantification of F4/80-positive cells (total macrophages) and of F4/80-CD206-double positive cells (M2 macrophages) was done by using the cell counter plugin included in ImageJ. No macro was used for positive stained cells. An example of the quantification is shown in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. Data can be plotted as bar graphs showing the percentage of M2-like macrophages over the total percentage of macrophages (mean ± SEM). The significance of differences between two experimental groups (<i>e.g</i>., mice infected with the control and the genotoxin <i>Salmonella</i> strain) is determined by the Student <i>t</i>-test. The significance of differences between three (or more) experimental groups is determined by ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD post-test. p values &lt;0.05 were considered significant. For a representative quantification of each experimental condition, we suggest to acquire 5 images of different fields across the organ, for a total of ∼2500 nuclei per mouse.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The major limitations of this protocol are related to the preservation of the tissue prior sectioning in order to maintain the proper architecture. Therefore, it is essential to immediately freeze down the Swiss rolls once they are prepared during the necropsy and to ensure that both the colon and the tissue sections slides are properly stored at −80°C until use. Furthermore, it is very important to avoid sections from drying out during staining and make sure that the tissues are always covered by the solutions during the whole procedure.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Successful performance of this staining mainly relies on the quality of the tissue sections and the use of proper fixation and blocking solutions.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Tissue sections are not properly prepared during cutting at the Cryostat (e.g., tissue sections are not stretched and flattened prior adhesion to the positively charged slide) (<a href="#before-you-begin">Before you begin</a>, steps 2 to 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When recovering the tissue section to the microscope adhesion slide, ensure that: i) the section is properly flattened; ii) place the microscope adhesion slide (on the positive charged side, indicated by “+”) parallel to the Cryostat platform. Once the tissue section is attached to the microscope adhesion slide, do not press down nor move the slide onto the Cryostat platform but place it immediately on dry ice to favor a better adhesion.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Incorrect solution used for fixation or blocking steps results in unspecific staining and high background (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>) (Steps 2 and 4).</p>

<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The problem of unspecific staining may rise especially due to incorrect procedure in fixation or in blocking.</p>
<p>For a proper fixation for this staining (step 2), store the acetone solution at −20°C for at least 24–48 h before carrying out the immunofluorescence assay. The acetone will evaporate during the incubation time. Therefore, it is important to not exceed the incubation time of fixation to avoid the sections to dry out for long time, which would lead to unspecific fluorescent signal.</p>
<p>The blocking step (step 4) is also crucial to mitigate the unspecific binding. To further improve the saturation of unspecific binding sites, it is recommended to increase the concentration of BSA from 1% to 2% (w/v) in the blocking solution.</p>
<p>If the staining still does not satisfy the expectations, we suggest to employ normal serum at 1%–5% (v/v) dissolved in 1<b>×</b> PBS with incubation for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Serum can be employed from the same species where the secondary antibodies were raised. Do not use the same species as the primary antibodies (<i>e.g.</i>, if the primary antibody was raised in rabbit and the secondary in goat, the goat serum might be employed to saturate unspecific binding sites but rabbit serum should not be used).</div>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Precipitates of secondary antibodies or traces of dirt are seen under microscopy all over the colonic tisue (step 7) (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure to properly mix secondary antibodies with fluorophores before use and/or replace and prepare a new solution if the one available has been stored for long-term. Furthermore, we suggest to increase the number of washes with 1<b>×</b> PBS after incubation with secondary fluorescent-conjugated antibodies to ensure the complete removal of traces of precipitates, dust and/or dirt.</p>
