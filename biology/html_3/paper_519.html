<h3 id="sec1.1">Experimental design considerations</h3>
<p>CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing uses a guide RNA (gRNA) to target the Cas9 endonuclease protein to the region of interest in the genome, where it introduces a site-specific double-strand break in the DNA (<a href="#bib1">Adli, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib9">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</a>; <a href="#bib22">Hsu et al., 2014</a>). Homology-directed repair (HDR) can be used in conjunction with a DNA template to repair Cas9 induced dsDNA breaks and achieve precise genome editing. This method is used to introduce specific mutations or to insert exogenous DNA sequences into a genome (<a href="#bib1">Adli, 2018</a>; <a href="#bib9">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</a>; <a href="#bib22">Hsu et al., 2014</a>). Here, we describe CRISPR-Cas9 protocols to introduce MS2 sequences into a gene in <i>Drosophila</i>, so that live imaging of transcription can subsequently be performed using the MS2/MS2 coat protein (MCP) system (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A) (<a href="#bib33">Pichon et al., 2018</a>). While some <i>Drosophila</i> studies have used short reporter transgenes carrying MS2 sequences (<a href="#bib10">Falo-Sanjuan et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib14">Fukaya et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib16">Garcia et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib30">Lucas et al., 2013</a>), inserting MS2 sequences into endogenous gene loci using CRISPR will allow transcription dynamics to be more accurately captured by ensuring all regulatory sequences are present.</p>

<p>(A) The MS2/MCP live imaging system visualizes transcription using RNA stem-loop repeats that are bound by the MS2-coat protein (MCP) fused to a fluorescent protein.</p>
<p>(B) MS2 stem-loops can be inserted into different endogenous genomic regions including 5′ and 3′ UTRs and intronic regions.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One experimental consideration is how many times it may be useful to target the same gene region. If the goal is simply to introduce 24 copies of the MS2 stem-loop sequences, then a one-step CRISPR approach, which directly inserts the MS2 cassette, will be quicker and simpler. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 events inserting a sequence into the genome directly, based on a single cut, occur more frequently than the replacement of sequences that include large deletions (<a href="#bib34">Poernbacher et al., 2019</a>). Alternatively, a two-step approach can be used when it is advantageous to repeatedly target the same gene locus. This approach deletes sequences from the gene locus and concomitantly inserts an attP site, which subsequently allows easy targeting of the region, through ΦC31-mediated reintegration, to add back different versions of the deleted sequence with MS2 stem-loops. For example, deletion of sequences from upstream of the promoter where enhancer(s) are located to within the 5′ UTR will allow different mutations to be subsequently introduced into enhancer sequences or the core promoter.</p>
<p>Another consideration is which MS2 stem-loops to use, as different versions are available. The commonly used loops in flies, 24XMS2SL-stable, have an extremely high affinity for the coat protein, which aids visualization. However, the strong RNA-protein interaction has been suggested to prevent RNA degradation and produce decay fragments in yeast (<a href="#bib15">Garcia and Parker, 2015</a>). Improved versions of the MS2 loops include less repetitive stem-loop arrays (MBSV5; Addgene, Cat# 84561) (<a href="#bib42">Wu et al., 2015</a>), allowing for PCR amplification and sequencing, and stem-loops that have reduced affinity for the coat protein with different linker lengths (MBSV6 and MBSV7; Addgene, Cat# 104391 and 140705) (<a href="#bib40">Tutucci et al., 2018</a>). The fluorescent signal can be increased by introducing a greater number of stem-loops into a locus as shown for a 128xMS2 cassette (<a href="#bib46">Tantale et al., 2016</a>). Additionally, there is an orthogonal PP7 stem-loop system, with the PP7 coat protein (<a href="#bib47">Chao et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib33">Pichon et al., 2018</a>), which can be used with MS2 or as an alternative to it. The two-step CRISPR protocol will facilitate the testing of different numbers of MS2 loops, for example, or insertion of PP7 sequences to allow simultaneous imaging of both alleles of a gene.</p>
<p>Finally, the MS2 stem-loops can be inserted into different genomic locations, such as the 5′ UTR, 3′ UTR or intronic regions, with advantages and disadvantages to each (<a href="#bib11">Ferraro et al., 2016</a>) (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). The fluorescent signal will be brighter when the stem-loops are positioned in the 5′ UTR compared to the 3′ UTR, as the loops in the 5′ UTR will be transcribed earlier and be available for MCP binding for longer (<a href="#bib16">Garcia et al., 2013</a>). Inserting loops in the 5′ UTR can potentially stall the scanning 40S ribosomal subunit and inhibit translation (<a href="#bib32">Palam et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib41">Vattem and Wek, 2004</a>), whereas introducing the loops into the 3′ UTR may disrupt mRNA regulation (<a href="#bib31">Mayr, 2017</a>). While neither of these is likely to alter the transcription dynamics, the fly stocks with the MS2 insertion may show reduced viability. Insertion of stem-loops into a large intron is not predicted to greatly affect splicing, although if splicing is efficient the loops will be very short lived decreasing the fluorescent signal.</p>

<p>We outline two different CRISPR approaches, a one-step method using one cleavage site and a two-step approach that uses two DNA cleavage sites (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). While MS2 sequences are used as an example here, other sequences can be inserted using the methods described.</p>

<p>The major steps of the two CRISPR-Cas9 approaches are outlined with associated timings.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In both approaches, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated HDR is performed using a dsDNA donor plasmid. The donor contains a gene encoding a visible transformation marker (for example <i>DsRed</i> or <i>mini-white</i>) flanked by loxP sites for Cre-recombinase-mediated removal and a multiple cloning site (MCS) for homology arm (HA) insertion (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A and 3B). The donor plasmid for the two-step CRISPR approach additionally contains an attP ΦC31 phage recombination site (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B), which can be used to reintegrate specific sequences including MS2 stem-loops in the second step.</p>
<figure id="fig3"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/519-Fig3.jpg" alt="Fig3.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 3. Overview of CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering approaches</div>
<p>(A) The one-step CRISPR approach uses a single site for gRNA directed, Cas9 mediated cleavage. A dsDNA donor plasmid is used for HDR and inserts 24xMS2 stem-loops into the endogenous gene locus. The donor plasmid also contains loxP sites and a marker gene.</p>
<p>(B) For the two-step CRISPR approach, the genome is cut at two cleavage sites by gRNA directed, Cas9 mediated cleavage. The dsDNA donor plasmid contains loxP sites, an attP recombination site and a marker gene (1). In the second step, the previously removed DNA sequence together with MS2 stem-loops is reintegrated into the genome using attP/B recombination and the combined marker cassette is subsequently removed by Cre recombination between the two outermost LoxP sites (2).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In short, the one-step CRISPR strategy uses a single cut site to introduce MS2 stem-loop sequences directly adjacent to the cleavage site into the endogenous locus together with a selectable marker that is subsequently removed (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A) (<a href="#bib13">Fukaya, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib19">Gratz et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib29">Lim et al., 2018b</a>, <a href="#bib28">2018a</a>).</p>
<p>The two-step CRISPR approach uses two cut sites to first insert an attP ΦC31 phage recombination site into the gene region of interest. In the second step, the attP ΦC31 recombination site is used to integrate MS2 stem-loops and the DNA sequences that were initially removed in step 1 (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B) (<a href="#bib2">Baena-Lopez et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib20">Hoppe et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If the protocols described here are to be used to insert a protein tag, the exact position of the tag can be chosen by removing a region from the genome using two gRNAs, whereas a single cut site will place the tag sequences directly adjacent to the cut site and therefore be limited by gRNA availability. The chances for off-target effects are increased when using two gRNAs versus one.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Different CRISPR-Cas9 approaches haven been documented in <i>Drosophila</i> and mainly differ in the delivery of gRNAs and Cas9. These components can be injected in the form of expression plasmids or <i>in vitro</i> transcribed RNA together with the donor plasmid (<a href="#bib3">Bassett et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib17">Gratz et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib43">Yu et al., 2013</a>). Expressing <i>Cas9</i> (<a href="#bib18">Gratz et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib38">Ren et al., 2013</a>) or <i>Cas9</i> and gRNAs (<a href="#bib26">Kondo et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib35">Port et al., 2014</a>) stably as a transgene(s) was shown to result in increased CRISPR efficiency and consistency. The efficiency of different Cas9 transgenes and gRNA expression systems have been compared by <a href="#bib35">Port et al. (2014</a>, <a href="#bib36">2015)</a>. A summary of CRISPR-Cas9 approaches, such as generation of loss-of-function alleles or complex gene modifications and their experimental considerations can be found in <a href="#bib19">Gratz et al. (2015)</a>. Experimental designs to insert tags into coding sequences through one-step or two-step CRISPR-Cas9 approaches are summarized by <a href="#bib34">Poernbacher et al. (2019)</a>.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Alternative HDR mediated CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques can be used to avoid genomic scarring. In <i>Drosophila</i>, scarless strategies have been developed that first introduce a marker gene, which is replaced, in a second step, by the desired sequences (<a href="#bib25">Kanca et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib27">Lamb et al., 2017</a>). Another scarless approach uses the pHD-ScarlessDsRed donor plasmid and requires the presence of a genomic TTAA site in close proximity to the target region. The TTAA site is targeted by a PiggyBac transposon to introduce a screenable marker (<a href="http://flycrispr.molbio.wisc.edu/scarless">http://flycrispr.molbio.wisc.edu/scarless</a>).</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 h</div>
<p>This section describes the identification of DNA cleavage sites and the design of gRNAs. gRNAs are generated to direct the Cas9 endonuclease to genomic regions of interest to introduce double-stranded DNA breaks. The gRNA is directed to the genomic region through base pairing with the 20 nucleotide (nt) genomic target sequence (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A and 3B).</p>
<h4 id="sec1.3.1">One-step CRISPR</h4>
<ol>
<li>Identify potential target sequences for DNA cleavage within the genomic region of interest by using the publicly available flyCRISPR target finder (<a href="https://flycrispr.org/target-finder/">https://flycrispr.org/target-finder/</a>).
<ol type="a">
<li>Enter the genomic DNA sequence to find CRISPR target sites and, where appropriate, select the reference genome based on the <i>Drosophila Cas9</i> line that will be used.</li>
<li>Optimal target sequences are 20 nt in length and located next to a 3 nt protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which is required for DNA cleavage (<a href="#bib24">Jinek et al., 2012</a>).</li>
<li>Select CRISPR targets with a 5′ G for optimized U6-driven transcription or add a 5′ G during the oligonucleotide design.</li>
<li>On the next page select high stringency. To reduce the probability for off-target effects the option “NGG PAM sites only” can be selected.</li>
<li>The website suggests cleavage target sites and highlights possible off-target sites. Carefully choose the target site best suited for the experiment (see Notes).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Select “design experiment” to view oligonucleotide sequences for the selected target. Order two oligonucleotides suggested by the website to generate one gRNA.
<ol type="a">
<li>Oligonucleotides contain CTTC 5′ and CAAA 3′ overhangs respectively, which are compatible with overhangs obtained in the pU6-BbsI-gRNA plasmid after BbsI digestion.</li>
<li>Oligonucleotides should be ordered with the 5′ end phosphorylated or should be phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase before use.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="sec1.3.2">Two-step CRISPR</h4>
<ol start="3">
<li>Identify one target sequence for DNA cleavage on either side of the genomic region of interest and follow the steps outlined above.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If the target site search returned no results, consider lower stringency, shorter or alternative target sequences or selecting targets with possible off-target sites (see <a href="#sec5.1">troubleshooting 1</a>).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The DNA cleavage site is located 3 nt away from the PAM sequence within the target sequence (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A and 3B).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Some genomic regions exhibit reduced CRISPR efficiency. The reasons for locus-specific effects on CRISPR efficiency are poorly understood. The cleavage efficiency for <i>Drosophila</i> regions can be predicted using an online tool developed by the Perrimon group (Harvard Medical School). This prediction tool uses data from high throughput experiments in S2 cells (<a href="https://www.flyrnai.org/evaluateCrispr/">https://www.flyrnai.org/evaluateCrispr/</a>).</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> When selecting gRNAs, avoid those recognizing sequences overlapping or close to known regulatory motifs in the DNA or mRNA such as enhancers, binding sites for transcription factors or RNA binding proteins, or splice sites. The integration of DNA sequences at these sites may disrupt their regulatory function, as the methods described leave a small scar in the genome.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can occur naturally and could lower CRISPR efficiency when present in the targeting sequence. To verify that no SNP is present in the target sequences or PAM sites, sequence the genomic region in the lab stock of the fly line that will be edited before cloning gRNAs or check the genome sequence if available.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.4">Homology arm design</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 h</div>
<p>This section describes the design of HAs that contain upstream/downstream genomic regions bordering the target cleavage site. HAs will be inserted into a dsDNA donor plasmid for HDR (see description in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section).</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Check the sequence of the genomic regions around the target sites in the fly line chosen for editing before cloning, either using the genome sequence if available or by sequencing the specific regions.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> A homology length of ∼1 kb was found to be efficient for integration. The efficiency of different homology length (100 bp to 7.5 kb) in dsDNA donors was investigated in detail by <a href="#bib5">Beumer et al. (2013)</a> and <a href="#bib25">Kanca et al. (2019)</a>.</div>
<h4 id="sec1.4.1">One-step CRISPR</h4>
<ol start="4">
<li>Design the HAs to be approximately 1 kb in length and directly adjacent to the genomic cleavage site for efficient HDR.</li>
<li>Design primers to amplify HAs from genomic DNA.
<ol type="a">
<li>To the primer ends add restriction enzyme target sites that are present in the multiple cloning site (MCS) in the donor plasmid but absent from the HAs (for details see <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Under certain circumstances the PAM sequence needs to be mutated, for example if a one-step CRISPR approach with two guide RNAs is chosen, as if the endogenous genomic DNA region is inserted directly next to the HA in the donor plasmid, the full guide and PAM sequences can be reformed. To prevent targeting of the donor plasmid by Cas9 and repeated targeting of the endogenous locus, a point mutation is necessary to mutate the “NGG” PAM (<a href="#bib19">Gratz et al., 2015</a>). In the example described here using one gRNA, the full target sequence will be disrupted by the MS2 stem-loop insertion at the cut site and therefore, no point mutation is necessary.</div>
<h4 id="sec1.4.2">Two-step CRISPR</h4>
<ol start="6">
<li>Design HAs to be approximately 1 kb in length. If gRNA/PAM sequences are in the PAM-in configuration as highlighted in this example (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B), HAs should not contain the 6 bps between the cleavage site and the end of the PAM sequence. Inclusion of the full target sequence will make the donor plasmid a target for Cas9 cleavage (<a href="#bib19">Gratz et al., 2015</a>).</li>
<li>Design primers to amplify the HAs from genomic DNA.
<ol type="a">

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 h</div>
<p>The second step of the two-step CRISPR engineering approach uses ϕC31 integrase-mediated, site-specific transgenesis to introduce the MS2 stem-loops and the genomic region, which was removed as part of step 1, back into the genome (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B). This section outlines the primer design to generate inserts and the cloning procedure will be outlined in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="sec1.5.1">Two-step CRISPR</h4>
<ol start="8">
<li>Design primers to amplify the genomic region, which was removed in CRISPR step 1. In this example, the genomic DNA region will be inserted upstream of MS2 stem-loops into the RIV<sup>cherry</sup>+24xMS2-stem-loop plasmid (available upon request) using EcoRI and NotI restriction sites respectively (for details see <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>). Use different restriction sites, if these sites are present in the genomic region used for reintegration.</li>
<li>Order PCR primers to amplify the genomic region, containing sequences to insert an EcoRI (forward primer) and NotI (reverse primer) restriction site.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Instead of a RIV<sup>cherry</sup> backbone, the RIV<sup>white</sup> plasmid can be used which contains a <i>mini-white</i> marker gene (Baena-Lopez et al., 2013). In order to use this plasmid backbone, the <i>mini-white</i> marker, inserted by the HDR donor plasmid, needs to be removed by Cre-mediated recombination before reintegration or a donor plasmid with a different marker gene needs to be used for HDR.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Instead of using classical cloning techniques to insert DNA sequences using restriction sites, other methods such as In-Fusion or Gibson cloning methods can be used to reduce the insertion of ectopic nucleotides into the endogenous genome. Alternatively, plasmids can be commercially synthesized that lack any additional nucleotides that would be inserted into the genome. Scarless CRISPR methods have also been described (<a href="#bib25">Kanca et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib27">Lamb et al., 2017</a>) but are generally more complicated, whereas the addition of a scar here is not viewed as particularly problematic given that additional MS2 sequences are being inserted.</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼6 days</div>
<p>This section describes how to insert gRNA oligonucleotides into the pU6-BbsI-gRNA (Addgene, Cat# 45946) plasmid, which will be used to deliver gRNAs (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A). The gRNA target sequences start with a 5′ G, which allows for efficient U6 promoter-driven expression. Oligonucleotide sequences were determined in the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section. This protocol was established by (<a href="#bib19">Gratz et al., 2015</a>) and is part of a cloning protocol selection by the FlyCRISPR website <a href="https://flycrispr.org/protocols/grna/">https://flycrispr.org/protocols/grna/</a>.</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Initially inject 200–400 <i>Drosophila</i> embryos.

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> When using the <i>DsRed</i> marker gene or another fluorescent marker, make sure to use a <i>Cas9</i> transgenic line without fluorescent markers of similar wavelength. Here we use a line with <i>nos-Cas9</i> on the X- chromosome and no additional markers. This line has the advantage that it is compatible with CRISPR schemes based on selection with a fluorescent protein or <i>mini-white</i>, but relies on loss of <i>nos-Cas9</i> over time.

<p>In this step, site-directed reintegration utilizing the attB-attP system is used to insert MS2 stem-loops and the sequences that were removed in the first CRISPR step into the endogenous gene locus. To this end, the previously deleted genomic sequences are inserted into the RIV<sup>cherry</sup>+24xMS2-stem-loop plasmid (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>A), upstream of the MS2 stem-loops. Other sequences can be introduced into the genome instead of the 24xMS2 stem-loops by using a similar approach.</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The two-step CRISPR approach will leave small scars in the genome in the form of the attR (attP/B) site at the 5′ end and one LoxP site (34 bps) at the 3′ end of the targeted locus. The plasmids used in this protocol contain minimal attP (50 bps) and attB (51 bps) sites (<a href="#bib2">Baena-Lopez et al., 2013</a>) that were established by <a href="#bib23">Huang et al., (2009)</a>, reducing the attR sequence length contained in the final engineered fly line to 48 bps. The small attR size minimizes the amount of sequence to be added in addition to the MS2 stem-loop cassette, but adding additional sequences will be more problematic for other CRISPR applications that target the coding sequence. Additionally, a few nucleotides will have been inserted depending on the restriction sites that were used for cloning. Most of these additional nucleotides can be avoided by using In-Fusion or Gibson cloning or commercially synthesizing the plasmid.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The expected outcome is the insertion of 24xMS2 stem-loops (or alternative donor sequence) into a specific position within the gene locus. Using the two-step CRISPR approach, the gene locus is marked with an attP site as an intermediate step, which can be used for further modification of the gene region. Tagging an endogenous locus with MS2 sequences will enable live imaging studies to investigate and quantitate nascent transcription dynamics. For our recent study investigating the transcriptional regulation of endogenous Bone Morphogenetic Protein target genes see <a href="#bib20">Hoppe et al., 2020</a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>While inserting MS2 sequences into the genome using CRISPR gives the advantage of allowing the study of endogenous transcriptional activity, it is also time consuming. CRISPR modification takes more time than generating a transgene and inserting it into a targeted landing site within the genome. Therefore, the advantages of being able to investigate endogenous transcription dynamics versus studying a reporter transgene have to be balanced with the time it takes to generate the fly lines. In addition, once the attP line is made using the two-step approach, test sequences can be rapidly targeted to the gene locus.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that the addition of MS2 stem-loops could alter gene expression. Even though transcription is not expected to be altered, it is possible that the addition of MS2 stem-loops to the 5′ or 3′ UTR leads to changes in translation efficiency or mRNA regulation (<a href="#bib31">Mayr, 2017</a>; <a href="#bib32">Palam et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib41">Vattem and Wek, 2004</a>). These potential disruptions to gene expression could lead to a reduced viability of fly stocks.</p>
<p>Some regions of the genome appear resistant to targeting. However, as there is flexibility in the placement of the MS2 sequences and therefore the gRNAs that can be used, this is not a major issue here.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Target site search returned no results or only those with multiple off-target sites.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If no target sites are found, consider lowering the stringency of the search. With a lower stringency, more target sites will be identified, as gRNAs often tolerate several mismatches in their seed sequence. The danger is that a lower stringency also increases the potential for off-target events.</p>
<p>The length of the seed sequence can be shortened to 16 nt to increase target site identification and reduce off-target probability. While sequences shorter than 16 nt can be used to guide Cas9, they are insufficient to promote endonuclease activity (<a href="#bib8">Dahlman et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib12">Fu et al., 2014</a>). It was shown that seed sequence lengths of 17 and 18 nt reduce the potential for off-target effects while at the same time retain normal efficiency in mammalian cells (<a href="#bib12">Fu et al., 2014</a>).</p>
<p>If no target sites are identified at the region of interest when using a single gRNA approach or only target sites with a high number of possible off-target binding sites are available, consider using two gRNAs. Choosing two target sites that are located upstream and downstream of the region of interest will allow modification of the region of interest but will require insertion of the DNA sequence between the cleavage sites into the donor plasmid to avoid a deletion.</p>
<p>Theoretically, other Cas proteins can be used that favor different PAM sequences and therefore make other target sites available. For example the Cas12a protein is available for use in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href="#bib37">Port et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Try to avoid off-target locations on the same chromosome arm or even the whole chromosome as the region of interest. Potential off-target events on other chromosomes can be crossed out.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>One of the plasmids cannot be generated.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Generally, oligonucleotides are easy to clone so problems generating the plasmids to express the gRNAs seem unlikely. It may be more difficult to clone a large sequence in the reintegration plasmid so if this is an issue, try to use gRNAs closer together to reduce the length of sequence needing to be replaced. Additionally, HAs can be shortened (<a href="#bib5">Beumer et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib25">Kanca et al., 2019</a>). If cloning is problematic, the DNA can be commercially synthesized.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>No CRISPR positive flies.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are many possibilities for why CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering is unsuccessful that relate to low viability of the flies or poor efficiency of editing. The DNA quality of plasmids for injection is crucial to ensure good viability so the DNA should be repurified to ensure it is clean. More embryos can be injected to increase the chances of an editing event and there are a range of commercial injection services that have experience in generating CRISPR edited flies. Post injection, dehydration of the vial containing survivors must be avoided as it can kill the larvae. Incubate the fly food vial containing injection survivors in a humidified incubator and add saturated filter paper to the fly food if it appears to be drying out. Adding liquid yeast paste to the food also increases survival of larvae. Finally, survival of adults is enhanced by removing them from the tube as soon as they eclose. The choice of line for injection also influences survival. Many researchers favor lines with <i>nos-Cas9</i> instead of <i>vas-Cas9</i>, as <i>nos</i> expression is more tightly confined to the germline (<a href="#bib36">Port et al., 2015</a>). Weak somatic <i>vas-Cas9</i> expression may lead to some lethality caused by somatic CRISPR events. In addition, if the locus being targeted is located on the X chromosome, it may be necessary to inject a greater number of embryos to achieve a successful modification. This is particularly relevant to the two-step protocol as it involves deletion of some sequences, which may cause lethality in males.</p>
<p>For the two-step CRISPR approach, try to reduce the amount of sequence deleted, as the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 events may depend on the size of the deletion. Even though large deletions of up to 30 kb have been successfully replaced with an attP site, smaller deletions can be obtained with a higher efficiency and limit rearrangements at the edited region (<a href="#bib34">Poernbacher et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p>The one-step protocol describes crossing the injected flies to a stock carrying balancers, as this saves time. As balancer stocks can be less healthy, to maximize progeny and increase the chances of identifying an edited fly it may be better in some cases to first cross injection survivors to wildtype flies.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 4</h3>
<p>No transformants are obtained for reintegration.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Transformation efficiency with the ϕC31 system is usually very high. However, if no transformants are identified, make sure that the attP site was inserted into the genome correctly by sequencing, and that the attB site in the reintegration plasmid is intact. Sequence the ϕC31 integrase containing plasmid and ensure good DNA quality of all plasmids before injecting more embryos. The efficiency of reintegration is reduced when longer sequences are reintegrated.</p>
