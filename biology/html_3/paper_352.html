<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Patient-derived tumor organoid cultures are an essential and innovative methodology for translational research. However, current techniques to establish these cultures are cumbersome, expensive, and often require irreplaceable clinical tissue from surgery or core biopsies. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) provides a minimally invasive biopsy technique commonly performed in clinical settings. Here, we provide a protocol for FNA. We have found that FNA provides a cost-effective, rapid, and streamlined method for tissue acquisition for cancer organoid culture.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib1">Lee et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="#bib2">Vilgelm et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">
<i>Ex vivo</i> specimen fine-needle aspiration (FNA)</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15–30 min</div>
<p>Fine-needle aspiration is a technique commonly used in a clinical setting to obtain cells for cytopathology and genetic testing. Here, we apply it to a research setting to obtain cells and cell clumps that will generate organoid cultures. FNA is advantageous over traditional digestion methods because it is much more gentle, allowing for increased cell survival.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The specimen and FNA-setup must be sterile for tissue culture. If performing the FNA on a specimen, obtain the tissue in a sterile fashion from surgery. If obtaining tissue from surgical pathology, ensure that sterile ink is used to mark the margins prior to FNA, as the ink in surgical pathology grossing rooms is often not sterile. If obtaining the specimen from an animal, ensure sterile technique when performing <i>in vivo</i> FNAs or when performing surgery on animals.</div>
<ol>
<li>Attach a sterile 25-gauge beveled needle to a sterile 10 mL luer-lock syringe and insert into a syringe holder.</li>
<li>If using surgical tissue, transfer specimen to a sterile petri dish within a laminar flow biosafety cabinet. If performing FNA <i>in vivo</i>, perform in a procedure room with sterile technique.</li>
<li>Immobilize the specimen/nodule with sterile-gloved fingers or sterile forceps and using your other hand, insert the needle with the syringe holder perpendicular to the specimen/nodule.</li>
<li>Apply backward pressure to the syringe using the syringe holder, while rapidly agitating back and forth in a “saw-like” motion within the specimen at a rate of 2–3 strokes per second (<a href="#mmc1">Methods Video S1</a>). This motion loosens tumor and other cells from the stromal matrix. One “needle pass” typically involves 10–20 forward strokes (excursions). For optimal tumor sampling, reangle the needle slightly with each excursion so that sampling occurs in a fan shape. The needle should not come out of the specimen/nodule until the 10–20 excursions have been completed and material is visible in the needle hub. The needle should not protrude from the opposite side of the specimen at any point. <a href="#sec6.1">Troubleshooting 1</a>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Traditionally, FNA is performed on patients when the nodule is 1 cm or greater in greatest dimension. However, <i>ex vivo</i> FNA has been successfully performed on specimens as small as 2 mm with adequate yield for organoid culture, including heavily fibrotic tumors.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The speed of the agitation/strokes/excursions is critical for cellular yield. If your yield is low, check that your stroke rate is at least 2–3 strokes per second and that needle is not passing through the tissue.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Once material is visible in the hub of the needle, release suction and remove the needle from the specimen.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Suction should always be released prior to removing the needle from the specimen.</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Following this process (a “needle pass”), rinse the needle in 20 mL of sterile, pre-warmed, RPMI or DMEM in a 50 mL conical tube. Expel needle contents into the conical tube and rinse needle 2–3 times.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Extensive rinsing (more than 3–4 times) will lead to increased cell shearing and lower yields.</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Repeat steps c–f 3–5 times.</li>
<li>Dispose of syringe and needle in appropriate sharps container.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> FNA yield is directly correlated with the experience of the person performing the technique. We recommend extensive practice on fruit or store-bought meat prior to attempting FNA on animals or critical specimens. In addition, different tumors may have different yields. Tumors with extensive necrosis or fibrosis may give lower viable cell yields.</div>

<p>Once you have obtained the cells from the FNA, they can be immediately plated using one of two culture methods. Semi-solid culture is useful for longer culture periods and free movement of cells. Disc culture can be beneficial for more compact organoid growth and allows for generation and propagation of two-dimensional cultures. We recommend using both semi-solid and disc culture methods for new organoid cultures, as the growth needs vary from sample to sample. See <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol describes an effective and minimally invasive method to establish patient-derived cell lines and three-dimensional growth of these cells. Between one to three weeks of culture, single cells and small clusters obtained from FNA grow to create small organoids (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Initial organoid culture success rates and long-term propagation rates following cryopreservation can be found in <a href="#bib2">Vilgelm et al., 2020</a>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Not all tumors robustly produce organoids, although most tumors we assessed grow with this method including thyroid, colon, pancreas, gastric, renal, and melanoma. We recommend utilizing both culture methods when a sample is collected (semi-solid and disc), as some samples will preferentially grow in the semi-solid culture, while others will preferentially grow as discs. In addition, not all tumor types will generate a robust population of 2D cells. Two-dimensional cultures are typically composed of both fibroblasts and tumor cells, with the fibroblast percentage increasing with each passage. In our hands, thyroid and melanoma grow the most robust 2D cultures, with gastrointestinal and renal tumors having fewer or no 2D cells.</p>
<p>It is vital to obtain the sample directly from surgery or as soon as it reaches surgical pathology. This is to make sure the samples are sterile. If the sample is not obtained during these times, the grossing/dissection in surgical pathology can cause contamination or cell death (i.e., ink, formalin, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Clogged needle during FNA.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very carefully unscrew the needle while holding the syringe holder/syringe combination. Pull the stopper back on the syringe holder/syringe combination then screw the needle back on. Put the needle in the rinsing media and press down forcefully on the stopper.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Organoid clumping after plating and during growth.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>To ensure even distribution of cells, pipet the cell suspension very well or invert to mix approximately 10 times.</li>
<li>Mixing the cells well before adding the Matrigel. While working with Matrigel, make sure to keep it and anything that contains it on ice until it is ready to start solidifying.</li>
<li>Pipetting vigorously can create heat and cause the Matrigel to start solidifying so mix keep the cell suspension with Matrigel on ice.</li>
<li>When plating semi-solid culture, pipet the cell suspension in a figure 8 motion while plating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Media evaporation.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>To grow robust cultures, some lines may need to be incubated for many weeks. Because of this, they can be prone to evaporation of complete media. To decrease evaporation, plate the cultures in the middle of the plate and fill the surrounding empty wells in the plates with sterile PBS.</li>
<li>Replenish the water pans in the incubator frequently to maintain humidity.</li>
<li>Place cells in a separate incubator that is not accessed as frequently to decrease exposure to door opening.</li>
<li>Replace or replenish the media more frequently.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Disc detachment from plate.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always use warmed media (37˚ C) when changing the media on disc cultures to prevent disruption of the Matrigel matrix. Cold media causes the Matrigel to dissociate.</li>
<li>Pipet carefully down the side of each well to prevent disc detachment.</li>
<li>Pre-warm the plate prior to plating the disc culture ensures better attachment.</li>
<li>When 2D cells extensively undermine the discs, the disc can detach, so this is a good point to freeze down the organoid disc.</li>
</ul>
