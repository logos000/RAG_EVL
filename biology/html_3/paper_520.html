<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Controversies remain over the standard procedures for the modeling of skin fibrosis and its use in <i>in vitro</i> testing of different drugs. Here, we report a reproducible protocol for producing a skin fibrosis model using human dermal fibroblasts seeded in collagen hydrogel. Detailed procedures for the fabrication of cell/hydrogel constructs, fibrosis induction, protein extraction for western blotting analysis are presented along with how this model can be employed for investigating the possible anti-fibrotic functions of certain chemical compounds.</p>

However, in the case of the highly acidic collagen matrix, the dead cells will have a rounded shape <b>(</b><a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>C<b>)</b>. The cell viability was confirmed by measuring the metabolic activity of the seeded cells, DNA quantification and live/dead assay using calcein AM and ethidium homodimer following 24 h of culture. These results are summarized in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. The percentage metabolic activity results are normalized to those from cells cultured directly in multiwell plates without seeding to hydrogels.</p>

<p>Finally, following the extraction of protein according to the previous procedures, SDS-PAGE and western blotting for α-SMA can verify the fibrosis induction. <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> shows the expression of α-SMA in cells extracted from hydrogels following TGF-β1 treatment as well as TGF-β1-treated cells in flasks only referring to fibrosis induction. Moreover, the analysis of protein expression is presented in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>. However, in the absence of TGF-β1 and culturing of cells in complete medium, there was no expression of α-SMA. Furthermore, for testing the possible anti-fibrotic effects of potential compounds, different concentrations can be added during the first 2 days of culturing in FBS-containing medium, or during the stage of induction of fibrosis using TGF-β1. Here, GB0139 (formerly known as TD-139), was used as a model anti-fibrotic drug, where it has proved efficacy against idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<a href="#bib7">MacKinnon et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib4">Delaine et al., 2016</a>). At the beginning, the viability and metabolic activity of the seeded cells inside collagen hydrogels were evaluated against different concentrations of TD-139. The cell proliferation was quantified by Quant-iT PicoGreen ds DNA Assay kit, while the metabolic activity was measured using alamarBlue Cell Viability Reagent (13%). It is noteworthy to mention that the drug solvent was 100% methanol, which reached less than 0.01% following the dilution to the different drug concentrations. The LD50 was found to be 50 ng/mL, and the concentrations 30 and 50 ng/mL were chosen for the next evaluation of their anti-fibrotic effects, where both the drug and TGF-β1 were diluted in the culture medium and added to the cell-loaded hydrogels. This resulted in the inhibition of α-SMA expression as found using western blotting analysis <b>(</b><a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a> and <a href="#fig6">6</a>).</p>

<p>Protein extraction from cells seeded in hydrogels has been reported using different techniques. These techniques are simple, and others have a certain degree of complexity <b>(</b><a href="#bib5">Huang et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib3">Burgess et al., 2017</a>). However, the procedures of cell isolation and protein extraction have not been standardized. This is due to the different behavior of cells inside the hydrogels, the diverse nature of materials used to fabricate hydrogels and the distinct types of crosslinking and methods of gelation. Here, we reported the method for isolation of dermal fibroblasts (or myofibroblasts) from physically crosslinked collagen hydrogel and protein extraction. These procedures may be beneficial when culturing other types of cell in physically crosslinked collagen irrespective of the target of the model.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol for fibrosis induction in a 3D model is based only on dermal fibroblasts in collagen hydrogel. Despite its simplicity and relying on TGF-β1 for inducing the differentiation of fibroblast to myofibroblasts, the induction of fibrosis via mechanical factors may be a more realistic model for fibrosis. It will also have more advantages for research groups interested in developing anti-fibrotic compounds, and we are working on that now. Furthermore, we have focused on dermal fibrosis, but we believe that the procedures for developing other models for fibrosis (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) will not be different from our designs. We are currently working on pulmonary fibrosis model. Here, we will focus on testing the expression of elastin as well as other extracellular matrix proteins involved in fibrosis. Moreover, technically, owing to the transparency of the hydrogel, precautions should be taken while performing cell culture procedures, not to lose the whole construct.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Cell death inside the hydrogel.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Check the passage number of the cultured cells and viability. Cells with passage numbers above 20 were found to die inside the hydrogel. <a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>B and 4C compare the morphology of live and dead cells inside collagen hydrogel, respectively.</li>
<li>Check the pH of the final collagen mixture before gelation. The cells were found to lose their viability at pH values below 7 and above 8.</li>
<li>Monitor the changes in cell morphology within 2 h of incubation with the hydrogel (step 9) and after adding the medium (step 10).</li>
<li>For the initial checking of viability of the used cell at the beginning of the experiments, it is preferred to test it 24 h following the seeding to the hydrogels without using any fibrosis inducer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Very low amount of extracted protein or isolated cell count</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To check the efficiency of the hydrogel degradation and cell extraction, the cells may be detected and counted in the aspirated solution following hydrogel degradation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before centrifugation (step 21e): cells can be detected and counted.</li>
<li>After centrifugation (step 21e): with the formation of cell pellets, there should be no detected cells in the supernatant. If there is no pellet and the cells are detected in the supernatant, check the cells attached to the plate and repeat the procedures of degradation.</li>
<li>In the case of collagen alone: there are neither pellets nor cells.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Not obtaining α-SMA expression using western blotting</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Making primary trials for loading a higher cell number to the hydrogels, protein extraction, and running SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting.</li>
<li>Increasing the concentration of TGF- β1.</li>
<li>Concentration of the extracted protein solution. For example, a protein concentrator with cutoff of 30 kDa can be useful for the concentration process and the further detection of α-SMA and β-actin.</li>
<li>Optimizing the working concentration of α-SMA and β-actin antibodies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The long procedures for protein extraction may cause a loss of a part of it</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended to use many wells for each testing group. For instance, using 10 wells per group, followed by mixing the components of all wells following the collagen digestion will result in a concentrated amount of protein suitable for the further SDS-PAGE and western blotting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The protein deprivation may cause a reduction in the expression or synthesis of certain proteins of interest for some research</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some primary trials may be performed using 1%–2% of FBS added to the culture medium during the primary stage of fibrosis induction in flasks, with testing the expression of the proteins of interests. At this FBS concentration, fibrosis may be induced, but the expression of α-SMA will either be expected to be weaker than in the case of complete serum deprivation or may need longer period of incubation. However, this has not been published elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>The response of different types of cells to different anti-fibrotic compounds/drugs using the same model may be different.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is the natural response of different cells from different organs to different drugs. It is suggested as a primary trial to be done by testing the effects of the target drug on the cells without loading to the hydrogel matrix, and compare its effects on two or three different cell lines.</li>
</ul>
