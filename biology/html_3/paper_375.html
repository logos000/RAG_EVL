<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this protocol, we took a “thermogenetics” approach to detect functional gap junction channels between cells in <i>Drosophila</i> egg chambers. We expressed the thermosensitive cation channel TrpA1-A in the germline using Gal4, and a fluorescent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] sensor (GCaMP6), in all follicle cells using the LexA/LexAop system. If gap junctions connect germ cells and follicle cells, we expect a temperature-dependent TRPA1-A-dependent cation influx into the germline from the culture medium to result in a GCaMP signal in follicle cells.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Miao et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Gap junctions are constitutively open channels allowing passage of molecules &lt;1–3 kDa between cells. The proteins capable of forming gap junctions - connexins in vertebrates and innexins in invertebrates – exhibit both channel-dependent and channel-independent functions. It is therefore important to establish where functional channels exist in tissues. Historically, identifying functional gap junctions between cells has relied upon dye injection and transfer, which is severely limited by physical access to the cells of interest. Therefore, in many biological processes where gap junction proteins are implicated, it has not been possible to assess where open channels exist. Optogenetic excitation of the light-sensitive ion channel Channelrhodopsin, combined with GCaMP Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, has revolutionized neurobiology by allowing investigators to manipulate and monitor ion fluxes with light. To date, such studies have been limited to excitable cells, which amplify the signal. A further constraint of optogenetics is that a two-photon microscope is typically required for precise photo-activation. An alternative to optogenetics is “thermogenetics,” which employs temperature-sensitive ion channels, such as Transient Receptor Potential (Trp) channels, instead of Channelrhodopsin. An advantage of thermogenetics is that Trp channel ion fluxes are &gt;10× the than Channelrhodopsin. A further difference is that a temperature shift activates the channel rather than photons. We wished to determine where in <i>Drosophila</i> egg chambers functional gap junction channels exist. So, we developed a thermogenetics approach and established that this technique can be used in non-excitable cells. We expressed the thermosensitive cation channel TrpA1-A in the germline using Gal4, and a fluorescent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] sensor (GCaMP6s), in all follicle cells using the LexA/LexAop system. If gap junctions connect germ cells and follicle cells, we expect a temperature-dependent and TRPA1-A-dependent cation influx into the germline from the culture medium to result in an increase in GCaMP fluorescence in follicle cells. This approach may be useful for mapping patterns of gap junction connectivity in other tissues and organisms though challenges exist, including the need to express the channel and sensor in different cell types and the limited signal-to-noise ratio in non-excitable cells.</p>

<ol>
<li>To start a thermogenetics experiment, first set up crosses to produce female flies with the appropriate genotypes.
<ol type="a">
<li>Collect 20 females of LexA-OP-GCaMP6s/Cyo; MAT-α-Gal4/Tm6B in 2–4 days.</li>

<li>Culture the flies in 18°C. Transfer the flies to a new vial after 10 days. Each cross can flip once. The progeny adults take 4 weeks to come out.</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li>In a new 200 μL Eppendorf tube, add 4 μL insulin solution to 196 μL dissecting medium. Remove the wash medium in the 500 μL Eppendorf tube and add 200 μL medium with insulin to it.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To identify different stage egg chambers using a dissecting microscope, we focus on the overall size of the egg chamber and the relative volume of the oocyte (yolk) as a proportion of the whole egg chamber. Generally, yolk accumulates in the oocyte from stage 7. Stage 8 egg chambers are typically 200 μm long. By stage 9, the oocyte occupies ∼1/3 the volume of whole egg chamber volume and ½ by stage 10. During stage 11, the nurse cells transfer the majority of their cytoplasmic contents into the oocyte so that at stage 12, the oocyte occupies the majority of the egg chamber volume. The dorsal appendages become visible in stage 13 and fully elongate in stage 14 (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E).</div>

<p>TrpA1-A is a temperature-sensitive cation channel that allows Na+ and Ca<sup>2+</sup> into cells at &gt;27°C (<a href="#bib6">Viswanath et al., 2003</a>). In this thermogenetics protocol, we express UAS-TrpA1 in the germline with MAT-α-Gal4 and GCaMP6s in follicle cells with FC-LexA. We grow the flies at 18°C, dissect egg chambers, and mount them for live imaging on Zeiss 780 confocal microscope equipped with an environmental chamber. We then measure baseline GCaMP fluorescence in the outer layer of the follicle cells and border cells at 23°C and shift the temperature to 32°C and measure the change in fluorescence.</p>
<p>Gap junction proteins form constitutively open channels in neighboring cells that allow small molecules &lt;1–3 kDa to pass (<a href="#bib2">Krysko et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#bib5">Skerrett and Williams, 2017</a>). Since gap junction channels have been reported to exist between the oocyte and follicle cells based on dye transfer (<a href="#bib1">Bohrmann and Zimmermann, 2008</a>), we expect a temperature-dependent rise in GCaMP signal in MAT-α-Gal4&gt;TrpA1 expressing LexA-OP-GCaMP6s under the control of a follicle cell LexA driver. In control egg chambers lacking TrpA1 expression, no increase in GCaMP fluorescence occurred upon temperature shift.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The primary advantage of this method over dye transfer is that no injection is necessary. Therefore in principle this method could be used for cells and tissues that are inaccessible to injection. However, the fold change ΔF is only about 20%.</p>
<p>The spatial resolution of thermogenetics is limited by the enhancers/promoters driving TrpA1 and GCaMP expression unless one makes new transgenes expressing TrpA1 and/or GCaMP directly under the control of desired enhancer/promoters. An optogenetics approach, i.e., expressing Channelrhodopsin in some cells and GCaMP in others and stimulating cation influx with light would provide higher spatial resolution. However, thermogenetics is more sensitive than optogenetics because the conductance of Trp channels is ∼10–20× higher than the conductance of Channelrhodopsins. In addition, activating Channelrhodopsin deep inside tissue would likely require 2-photon excitation. Nevertheless these approaches would greatly enhance the study of gap junction proteins and aid in discriminating between their channel-dependent and channel-independent functions.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Too few stage 10 egg chambers in the ovaries (related to step 2).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The quality of ovary largely depends on the fattening time. In our hand, fattening the flies in 18°C for 2 days with fresh made yeast paste gives best result.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Egg chambers move during imaging (related to step 13).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Mount the sample carefully to avoid this problem. Uneven mounting, bubbles or too much medium/halocarbon oil can cause this problem. Do not mount too many egg chambers on one dish and do not select too many egg chambers in one experiment.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The GCaMP signal is too weak (related to step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When border cells complete their migration at stage 10A, they dock to anterior dorsal side of oocyte membrane. So, when dorsal or dorsal lateral side of the egg chamber faces the objective during imaging, the border cells are closer to the objective, hence it gives better signal. When the ventral or ventral lateral side faces the objective, the border cells are away from the objective, the signal hence much weaker. We found the orientation of egg chambers significantly affects the border cell GCaMP signal. Since the border cells associate with the dorsal/anterior aspect of the oocyte, and interact first with a dorsal centripetal cell, we restrict the analysis to those egg chambers that happen to be oriented with the dorsal side closest to the objective lens. We exclude egg chambers oriented with the ventral side closest to the objective lens. We also suggest not use high laser power or long exposures to prevent photobleaching.</p>
