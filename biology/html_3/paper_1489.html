<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol represents an optimized proteomics-based protocol for the endogenous protein enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis. This 2-step protocol consists of: 1) co-immunoprecipitation of the bait protein; 2) the bait-protein interactions analysis using LC-MS/MS. Here, we used Dynabeads® for the enrichment of the target protein (the bait) and its interactors. We have tested the protocol using several different cell lines. Our conclusion is that the protocol is applicable to different cell lines and species.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(22)00114-9/sref3">Lagundžin et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol was used in a recent publication by Lagundžin and co-authors (<a href="#bib3">Lagundzin et al., 2019</a>), in which a proteomics-based approach was employed to study the role of Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A (FANCA) in pancreas β islet cells. We initially tested the protocol using human embryonal kidney 293 FT, human pancreatic islet EndoC-βH3 and human pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cell lines. This protocol has been used at our Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Core Facility, at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, as a standard protocol for protein enrichment and interactome analysis. Besides the human cell lines, the protocol has been tested in experiments with mouse, rat and pig tissues and physiological fluids.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</h2>
<h3 id="sec3.1">Extraction of protein from cell lines</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 – 3 h</div>
<p>Start with a mammalian cell line that reached confluency of around 80%. For this protocol, around 2.5 mg of total protein is needed per sample to be analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Growth kinetics, total protein concentration and appropriate amount of cell culture plates/flasks of the chosen cell line should be determined before the start of the experiment. For illustrative purpose, the cells are assumed to be harvested from 100 mm plates.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cells are grown in plates/flasks to around 80% confluency in recommended cell culture medium. For our adherent cell lines, we use plates.</li>
<li>Cells are prepared for lysis.
<ol type="a">
<li>Culture medium is removed by aspiration and discarded.</li>
<li>Cells are washed with 10 mL ice-cold PBS.</li>
<li>The PBS used for washing is discarded.</li>
<li>2 mL of ice-cold PBS is added to each 100 mm plate.</li>
<li>Cells are detached from the plate using a cell scraper.</li>
<li>The cell suspension in PBS is transferred to a conical centrifuge tube with a pipette.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the sample for 10 min at 4°C at 1,000×<i>g.</i>
</li>
<li>The supernatant is discarded, and the cell pellet is used to obtain protein lysates in the following steps.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>The soluble protein lysate is isolated.
<ol type="a">
<li>The cell pellet is lysed by adding an amount of lysis buffer that is 3 times the pellet size (v/v).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Tris-based buffer may be used as well, instead of HEPES-based one, that we used.</div>
</li>
<li>The cell pellet is disrupted using lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min in Eppendorf tubes.</li>
<li>The lysate is centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C at 16,000×<i>g.</i>
</li>
<li>The supernatant containing the soluble protein extract is transferred to a new Eppendorf tube.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>The protein concentration is determined using BCA Protein Assay kit. Using this kit, only 1 μL of a sample is needed for the protein concentration measurement.</li>
<li>Aliquots containing 2.5 mg of protein in Eppendorf tubes are made and are stored at −80°C until use.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec3.2">Generation of beads and antibody coupling</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 24 h</div>
<p>The commercially available Dynabeads® Antibody Coupling Kit, which contains 2.8 μm magnetic M-270 Epoxy beads, was used for antibody coupling. All the reagents (C1, C2, HB, LB, SB) are provided in the kit. All the tubes used were 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>For each sample, 3 mg of Dynabeads® M-270 Epoxy beads are weighed and transferred into a microcentrifuge tube.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This amount of beads was optimized for our mass spectrometry experiments to efficiently immunoprecipitate the bait protein with minimum background interference.</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>To begin washing the beads, 1 mL of C1 is added and slowly pipetted up and down.</li>
<li>The tubes containing the Dynabeads are placed inside of the tube rack with magnets for 1 min to allow the beads to accumulate.</li>
<li>The supernatant is removed and discarded.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Care should be taken to not disturb the accumulated beads. We use gel loading tips for the supernatant removal. This is to avoid accidentally removing the beads during this process.</div>
<ol start="10">
<li>The tubes containing the Dynabeads are removed from the magnetic rack.</li>
<li>50 μg of the antibody (Ab) specific for the protein of interest (<i>the bait protein</i>) is added to the tube containing the Dynabeads.</li>
<li>In a separate tube, 50 μg of normal IgG is added, which acts as a negative control.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For protein-protein interaction analysis, it is crucial to prepare a negative control, such as normal IgG, to help identify adventitious proteins so that false-positive interactions can be annotated. The IgG control should be sourced from the same species as the Ab used for the protein of interest.</div>
<ol start="13">
<li>The appropriate volume of C1 is added to each of the tubes (from steps 10 and 11) to reach a final volume of 150 μL.</li>
<li>150 μL of C2 is added to each of the tubes.</li>
<li>The tubes are then incubated at 37°C for around 18 h on an orbital rotator.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The volume of mix Ab + C1 + C2 should be 300 μL for 3 mg of beads, to mix efficiently. The appropriate volumes of antibodies used in these steps is dependent upon the concentration of the antibody supplied by the vendor, which can vary widely. If the antibody is dilute and a larger volume is required, start with more beads at step 5 in order to achieve the proper ratio for incubation.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Make sure the beads are mixing well, as they can settle at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube. Use a higher rotation speed for the first 30 min, if possible, and then incubate around 18 h with gentle rotation.</div>

</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The elution with a high pH buffer does not disrupt the antibody attached to the beads, which avoids problems associated with the heavy and light IgG chains interfering with the results. A high abundance of IgG in the sample can impair the mass spectrometry detection of peptides/proteins that interact with the bait protein. As an alternative to the high-pH elution buffer, a low-pH elution buffer may be used instead. For example, a glycine-HCl buffer can be used, however we didn’t test it in our protocol.</div>
<ol start="41">
<li>The supernatants (which will be around 500 μL) are collected and transferred to new Eppendorf tubes.</li>
<li>The samples are then concentrated using a SpeedVac to volume around 50 μL.</li>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Before moving to the mass spectrometry step, we strongly advise to confirm first that the Co-IP was successful using Western blot (use 5 μL or less, out of 50 μL of the total immunoprecipitate, depending on the quality of the antibodies). The band corresponding to the bait protein should be visible only in the immunoprecipitate from the Ab-conjugated beads, and not in the negative IgG controls. If the bait protein is identified by western, an additional blot for known interacting proteins can also act as additional validation the Co-IP steps are appropriate.</div>

<p>At this stage, the bait protein and its interacting protein partners are being separated on a gel, digested to peptides, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Alternatively, an in-solution digestion protocol can be used instead of this in-gel digestion protocol. In-gel digestion protocol might be useful here, however, as it allows protein visualization before further steps and can reveal if the previous Co-IP was successful or not. The in-gel digestion method remains as an efficient and reproducible method for this type of analysis. 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes are used throughout the steps, as they are very compatible with mass spectrometry (low leaching effect).</p>

If the experiment is done in triplicate for each sample, a label-free quantitation workflow can be incorporated into the analysis with software such as Proteome Discoverer. Consult the vendor’s manual for detailed instruction. There are also algorithms such as Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT; <a href="http://saint-apms.sourceforge.net/Main.html">http://saint-apms.sourceforge.net/Main.html</a>) that can differentiate the <i>bona fide</i> interactors from the adventitious non-specific proteins. Consult the developer’s website for installation and analysis guidelines. We recommend that these experiments be performed in duplicate or triplicate biological replicates to confirm the reproducibility of the results. In addition, validation with orthogonal experimental methods such as co-IP of the identified prey followed by detection by western blot of the original bait or yeast/mammalian two-hybrid systems are important to confirm individual interactions.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol is optimized for the enrichment of endogenous bait protein, and the identification and analysis of its interacting partners using mass spectrometry. The bait protein is expected to be one of the top-ranking proteins in the database search results. There should also be an intense band at the molecular weight corresponding to the bait protein after the gel Coomassie staining. Non-specific binders (contaminants) such as keratins and similar are expected to be found to some extent in all samples but should not affect the final list of specific interactors, as they can be excluded based on the results of the negative control IgG probe. The number of proteins detected as interactors depends on several factors, including the cell line and the efficiency, specificity of the antibody, and natural variation in protein interactions between different bait proteins. In our experiment with 293FT cell line, we identified 137 FANCA interactors, whereas in the experiment with EndoC-βH3, more than 200 unique FANCA interactors were found (<a href="#bib3">Lagundzin et al., 2019</a>). The use of this protocol provided new insights into the role of FANCA specific to pancreatic β cells.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Studying the protein interactome is very challenging, as some of the interactions might be dependent upon specific stimuli or transient nature, such as enzyme-substrate interactions. In protocols where co-immunoprecipitation is employed, the challenge starts with the cell lysis steps, as this may obstruct the detection of weak protein interactions (<a href="#bib5">Sinder et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib2">Dunham et al., 2012</a>). It was reported that sometimes protein interactors cannot be detected at all if the target protein is a part of large protein complexes that require their natural environment in the cell to maintain their association (<a href="#bib4">Miernik and Thelen, 2008</a>; <a href="#bib2">Dunham et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib6">Smirle et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib5">Sinder et al., 2015</a>). The experimental outcome using this protocol depends on the efficiency of the antibody to immunoprecipitate the bait protein and is improved by use of the appropriate negative control, IgG. If some protein interactions are known for the bait, the presence of these detected by either western blot or LC-MS/MS following Co-IP in the specific Ab pulldown but not the IgG control can act as a validation that the purification procedure is working, protein interactions are maintained, and the Co-IP conditions (namely washing steps) were appropriate. The specificity of the control IgG is of high importance, as it should not bind to the bait protein. Having a good negative control is crucial, as sometimes a portion of non-specific proteins remain in the eluate, despite many washing steps.</p>
<p>We tested the protocol using different cell lines, and although we didn’t test it yet for tissue samples, <a href="#bib7">Zafar et al. (2017)</a> used Dynabeads® to study the protein interactome in human tissue samples and reported promising results.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Bait protein was not detected with Western blot (see recommendations in the CRITICAL section following step 42).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We report that the starting protein amount should be 2.5 mg. However, you can try to increase the protein amount in your sample. You may also try increasing the amount of antibody. Finally, it is possible that the expression of the target protein is weak in your cell line.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Bait protein is detected by Western blot and/or LC-MS/MS but is also identified in the IgG sample.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This problem is most likely due to issues arising in the Co-IP steps. We noticed this problem mostly when IgG used was of a mouse origin. However, <a href="#bib1">Andolino et al. (2018)</a> reported no issue using mouse IgG. Some proteins that could be used as bait are naturally adventitious and the appropriate experimental procedures must be optimized to ensure the bait is not also present in the negative control. Utilizing a different normal IgG source, changing the type of beads, or switching to an affinity epitope tagging system for the bait could help reduce non-specific binding of the bait in the negative control, as you cannot proceed with the experiment if IgG is non-specifically binding the bait protein. Additional wash steps during the Co-IP can also decrease non-specific interactions. In some cases the bait protein is found in the IgG control detected by LC-MS/MS, this could be the result of carryover contamination when the LC system is not adequately flushed between injection of samples. It is recommended that a blank sample containing a peptide standard be run between analytical samples. This can help identify potential carryover contaminants as well as flush the system to prevent this problem.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>There are too many interactors detected with mass spectrometry.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is unusual that thousands of proteins represent the real interactors to any protein. This happens when non-specific proteins remain bound to the target protein and create a ‘background’ on the spectra. This can also occur if many non-specific proteins bind to the antibody-coupled beads. This can usually be avoided by increasing the number of washing steps during Co-IP (steps 31–34). Also, instead of the 18–24 h Co-IP suggested in step 30, you may try decreasing the time available for adventitious proteins to bind to the beads by decreasing the time of bait protein capture to around 4–8 h.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>There are too many contaminants, such as keratins and polymers detected by mass spectrometry.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that all reagents and solution used are ‘mass spectrometry’ grade, and that specific attention was given to clean lab practices, such as using gloves and thoroughly cleaning surfaces. This should eliminate many common contaminants.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>There are too few interactors detected.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that all reagents and solution used are freshly made prior to each step. Special attention should be given to the peptide extraction buffer (see recipe for PXB) (used in steps 76–81) and all the solutions used to clean the samples before LC-MS/MS, to avoid any possible peptide loss.</p>
