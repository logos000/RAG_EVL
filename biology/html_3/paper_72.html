<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol describes the isolation, handling, culture of, and experiments with human colon stem cell organoids in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF). In human colon organoids, the function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein and its rescue by CFTR modulators can be quantified using the forskolin-induced swelling assay. Implementation procedures and validation experiments are described for six CF human colon organoid lines, and representative CFTR genotypes are tested for basal CFTR function and response to CFTR-modulating drugs.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Dekkers et al (2016)</a> and <a href="#bib2">Berkers and van Mourik (2019)</a>.</p>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> All laboratory procedures related to colon organoid or cell cultures should be performed in a laminar flow to avoid contaminations and to protect the operator from biological risks.</div>
<h3>Preparations</h3>
<ol>
<li>Prepare Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium with additional 1% (v/v) pen- strep (10,000 U/mL) and 10% (v/v) FBS (DMEM +/+) and pre=warm to 37° C</li>
</ol>
<h3>Wnt-3A Conditioned Medium (WCM) Production</h3>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> it is strongly advised to produce and mix multiple batches (2–3) of WCM to compensate for batch-batch variation during WCM production. Each round can produce around 1,100 mL of WCM leading to a WCM pool of 2,200 (mix of 2 batches)– 3,300 mL (mix of 3 batches) of which the total production time is between 20 (two batches) and 24 (3 batches) days.</div>
<ol>
<li>Thaw a cryovial with L-Wnt-3A cells by putting 13 mL of pre-warmed DMEM +/+ medium in a 15 mL tube (when thawing multiple cryovials, use a 50 mL tube with 30 mL DMEM +/+).</li>
<li>Transfer the cells from the cryovial to the 15 mL tube by resuspending the cells in DMEM +/+.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the 15 mL tube at 450 <i>g</i> for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 25 mL pre-warmed DMEM +/+ with additional 31.25 μL zeocin (final concentration 125 μg/mL).</li>
<li>Make sure that a homogenous cell suspension is obtained and transfer the cell suspension to a T175 flask.</li>
<li>Incubate the T175 flask for 3–4 days at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>Split the cells when 90%–100% confluency is achieved into 6 x T175 flasks:</li>
<li>Remove the DMEM +/+ from the T175 flask.</li>
<li>Gently wash the cells once with 5 mL PBS0 and discard the PBS0.</li>
<li>Add 1.5 mL 0.05% Trypsin EDTA and leave at 18–23 ° C for 7–10 min until the cells are detached.</li>
<li>Add 10.5 mL DMEM +/+ medium, take up all the cells and resuspend until a homogenous cell suspension is achieved.</li>
<li>Add 2 mL DMEM +/+ of the cell suspension to each new T175 flask and top up to 25–30 mL of total DMEM +/+ per flask:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>5 x T175 flask in DMEM +/+</li>
<li>1 x T175 flask in DMEM +/+ with zeocin, use this flask for the next production batch when the cells are 90%–100% confluent again (usually after 3–4 days).</li>
</ul>
<p>When the cells in the five T175 flasks containing DMEM +/+ are 90%–100% confluent (usually after 3–4 days), split the cells in 145 mm Petri dishes:</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Remove DMEM +/+ medium from the flasks and wash once with 5 mL PBS0.</li>
<li>Add 0.05% Trypsin EDTA and leave at 18–23 ° C for 7–10 min.</li>
<li>Add 3.5 mL of DMEM +/+ per flask, pool the cells from all five T175 flasks, and resuspend until a homogenous cell suspension is achieved (total volume = 25 mL DMEM +/+ medium with cells).</li>
<li>Measure the cell concentration per mL and dilute the cell suspension needed for seeding in 50 145 mm tissue culture Petri dishes to create one (the first) batch with 1100 ml of WCM. For 50 145 mm (2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells per 22 ml ∗ 50=) 100 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells are needed in 1100 ml.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Determine the cell concentration (with e.g. hemocytometer) [in #cells/mL] = Y</li>
<li>Calculate 100/ Y = X, the volume of the cell suspension to dilute in 1100 ml.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="16">
<li>Make sure the cell suspension is homogeneous and add 22 mL of cell suspension per 145 mm tissue culture Petri dish.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> When more than the necessary amount of cells is counted, a part of the cell suspension may remain unused or extra 145 mm Petri dishes can be seeded.</div>
<ol start="17">
<li>Incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 8 days (do not harvest the WCM/ DMEM +/+ before day 8)</li>
<li>Harvest the WCM from the Petri dishes in sterile 50 mL tubes and discard the Petri dishes with cells.</li>
<li>Centrifuge for 5 min at 650 <i>g</i> to remove floating cells and debris.</li>
<li>Filter medium through a 0.22 μm filter (stericups are preferable).</li>
<li>Store the WCM in 50 mL tubes or in 0.5–1 L containers at 4 °C.</li>
<li>Repeat the splitting of a 1 x T175 flask for the next batch as described above for 2–3 batches per WCM production.</li>
<li>WCM can be stored at 4°C and used for 2 months. Testing and approving of the WCM batches: WCM quality can be tested by culturing organoids with this specific WCM batch. Differentiated, non- budding round, thick-walled organoid structures indicate low Wnt activity (also see <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>C). Running human colon organoid cultures often need time to adjust to a new batch of WCM. Judge organoid cultures after 2 weeks before making conclusions on the WCM quality.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> A running L-wnt3a cell line can be used for the production of multiple batches of WCM until passage 18–20.</div>
<h3>Noggin Conditioned Medium (NCM) Production</h3>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> HEK293T Noggin hFc cells are poorly adhesive cells (especially the first passage after thawing). At the first passage after thawing leave the cells for at least 5 days without touching. Make sure to handle the cells gently during washing with PBS0 to avoid detaching. An extra passaging step before starting the harvesting steps is strongly recommended to let the cells recover from the freeze-thawing step.</div>
<ol>
<li>Thaw a cryovial with HEK293T Noggin hFc cells by putting 13 mL of pre-warmed DMEM +/+ in a 15 mL tube (when thawing multiple cryovials, use a 50 mL tube with 30 mL DMEM +/+).</li>
<li>Transfer the cells from the cryovial to the 15 mL tube by resuspending the cells with DMEM +/+.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the 15 mL tube at 450 <i>g</i> for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 40 mL pre-warmed DMEM +/+ with additional G418 (final concentration 500 μg/mL).</li>
<li>Make sure that a homogeneous cell suspension is achieved and transfer the cell suspension to a T175 flask.</li>
<li>Incubate the T175 flask for 7 days at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>Split the cells when 90-100% confluence is achieved into 6 x T175 flasks.</li>
<li>Gently remove the DMEM +/+ from the T175 flask.</li>
<li>Gently wash the cells once with 5 mL PBS0 and discard the PBS0.</li>
<li>Add 1.5 mL 0.05% Trypsin EDTA, leave at 18–23 ° C for 7–10 min until the cells are detached.</li>
<li>Add 10.5 mL DMEM +/+ medium, take up all the cells and resuspend until a homogenous cell suspension is achieved.</li>
<li>Transfer the cell suspension to 15 mL tube</li>
<li>Count the cells (with e.g. hemocytometer)</li>
<li>Add 5∗10<sup>6</sup> cells in 25 mL culture medium and transfer to a new T175 flask:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>1 x T175 in culture medium with G418 (500 μg/mL), use this flask for the next batch (usually cells are confluent after 3–4 days).</li>
<li>X (depending on amount of cells) x T175 in culture medium without G418.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the cells seeded in DMEM +/+ without G418 are ∼90% confluent (usually after 3–4 days):</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Remove the DMEM +/+ from the T175 flasks</li>
<li>Gently (to avoid detachment of the cells) add 50 mL of Ad-DF+++ per flask.</li>
<li>Incubate the flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 8–10 days.</li>
<li>Harvest the Ad-DF+++ (NCM) on day 8–10. Never harvest NCM before day 8 or when cells are not at least 100% confluent.</li>
<li>Pool the NCM from the T175 flasks in sterile 50 mL tubes and discard the T175 flasks.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the NCM for 5 min at 650 <i>g</i> to remove floating cells and debris.</li>
<li>Filter medium through a 0.22 μm filter (stericups are preferable).</li>
<li>Store the NCM in 50 mL tubes or in 0.5–1 L containers at −20 °C.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stock Preparation of Human Colon Organoid Medium Components</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5–6 hours</div>
<p>Human colon organoid medium consists of several chemical components as well as self-produced conditioned media, such as Wnt-3A conditioned media (WCM) and Noggin conditioned media (NCM). In this protocol hR-spondin-3 (R-spo3) was preferred over self-produced R-spondin-1 conditioned media. However, a R-spondin-1 producing cell line is available and could be preferred due to cost reduction of media. R-spondin-1 conditioned media can also be stored for 1 year at -20 °C.</p>
<h3>Preparing 2x Colon Organoid Medium −/−</h3>
<p><a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> shows how to dissolve all individual components, whereas <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a> shows how to prepare 2x colon organoid medium (2x CM) −/− by addition of all reagents except WCM and R-spo3. It is advisable to calculate the medium amounts that will be used within the following 2.5 months and adjust the volume of 2x CM −/− preparation.</p>

<h3>Transport of Biopsies to the Laboratory</h3>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Intestinal crypts can be retrieved from a rectal/ colon biopsy (hereafter referred to as “colon biopsy”) with a high efficiency (&gt; 95% success rate) within 48 h of the biopsy collection. However, tissue quality gradually decreases over time leading to a reduced chance of successfully isolating crypts from the biopsies. Therefore, immediate transport of the colon biopsies at 4 °C in AD-DF+++ is essential to ensure successful crypt isolation and establish efficient colon organoid cultures.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Good quality colon biopsies should be round and have a slightly pink to red color (see <a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a>). When you are uncertain about the quality of the rectal biopsies, please check if intestinal crypts are visible under the light microscope. Good quality biopsies show a honeycomb- like structure in which the stem cell crypts reside. If this structure is not visible, the biopsy is of bad quality (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B).</div>

<p>(A) Good quality biopsies; note the honeycomb structure indicative of intestinal crypts.</p>
<p>(B) Bad quality biopsies, this can be due to lack of tissue depth of the biopsy leading to an absence of intestinal crypts.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol>
<li>The colon biopsies should be stored on ice or at 4°C (fridge) in properly labelled 50 mL polypropylene conical tubes containing 30 mL of PBS0. Make sure the tissue is NOT frozen.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If the biopsies are transported over long distances or over a long duration (&gt;8 hs) before the crypt isolation procedure can be initiated, the biopsies should be stored in Ad-DF+++ with additional gentamicin (50 μg/mL) and vancomycin (50 μg/mL) at 4°C.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Make sure the 50 mL conical tube containing the colon biopsy in the storage medium is tightly closed and properly labelled. The date of the biopsy collection should be written on the tube (preferably on a sticker).</li>
<li>During the biopsy transport, the temperature needs to be 4°C. Please use cold gel or ice packs during the shipment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Wet ice should not be used for the shipment, since thawing ice might damage the labelling of the tubes.</div>
<h3>Organoid Crypt Isolation from Human Colon (Rectal) Biopsies</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼3 h</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> All laboratory procedures related to colon organoid or cell cultures should be performed in a laminar flow to avoid contaminations and to protect the operator from biological risks.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Always keep matrigel at 4°C or on ice to prevent polymerization above 10 °C.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Pre-warm 24- and 96-wells plates used for organoid culturing to 37 °C for a minimum of &gt;1 day. This is essential to ensure that after the colon organoids are plated, the matrigel polymerizes in the well efficiently and forms stable drops.</div>
<h4>Preparations</h4>
<ol>
<li>Prepare cold Ad-DF+++ and cold PBS0 (4 °C).</li>
<li>Thaw (and keep) matrigel on ice or at 4 °C and dilute 1:1 with cold CM +/+ (= 50% matrigel).</li>
<li>Prepare CM +/+ with additional gentamicin (50 μg/mL) and vancomycin (50 μg/mL) to reduce the risk of infection.</li>
</ol>
<h4>EDTA Incubation</h4>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> In every step of this procedure, when handling the biopsies with pipettes, it is necessary to pre-coat the pipettes with Ad-DF+++ by aspirating media into the pipettes and discard the media. This covers the inside of the pipets with liquid and prevents biopsies from adhering to the plastic.</div>
<ol>
<li>Wash the colon biopsies several times in cold PBS0 until the supernatant is clear using the following procedure:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>Pipet the biopsies up and down ∼10 times in 10 mL with a 10 or 25 mL pipet.</li>
<li>Let the biopsies settle at the bottom for 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Remove the supernatant and add 10 mL of clean cold PBS0.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps 2–4 times until the biopsies and supernatant are clear of debris.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Discard the supernatant and add 10 mL of clean PBS0 to the biopsies and supplement it with 200 μL ultrapure EDTA pH 8, 0.5 M (final concentration 10 mM).</li>
<li>Place the tube on a roller mixer for 90–120 min at 4 °C. The incubation time is dependent on the time between the biopsy collection and the start of the crypt isolation procedure. The longer the interval between biopsy collection and isolation procedures, the longer it is required to incubate. Crypts can be isolated from colon biopsies up until 48 h after biopsy collection but crypt yield decreases over time.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Isolate Intestinal Crypts from Biopsies</h4>
<ol>
<li>Allow the colon biopsies to settle at the bottom of the tube.</li>
<li>Discard the supernatant (PBS0 + EDTA).</li>
<li>Add 3 mL cold PBS0 to the tube containing the biopsies and pipet the biopsies up and down vigorously 10–20 times. Crypts are released from the biopsies and float in the PBS0, which is visible by eye through the observation of the solution becoming more cloudy. If no crypts emerge from the colon biopsies after 90–120 min of EDTA incubation add new PBS0 + EDTA and incubate for another 60 min.</li>
<li>Allow the biopsies to settle at the bottom and transfer the supernatant with the crypts to a clean 15 mL tube.</li>
<li>Add fresh 3 mL of cold PBS0 to the biopsies again and repeat previous steps until no more crypts detach or until a sufficient amount of crypts are transferred to the clean tube.</li>
<li>Add Ad-DF+++ to top up the solution containing the crypts in the 15 mL tube and centrifuge the crypts at 130 <i>g</i> for 5 min at 4 °C.</li>
<li>Gently remove the supernatant, the crypt cell pellet is vulnerable and can easily be lost by aspiration.</li>
<li>Add 10 mL of Ad-DF+++ to the crypt pellet for a second washing step and centrifuge at 130 <i>g</i> for 5 min at 4 ºC.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Plating Intestinal Crypts in Matrigel</h4>
<ol>
<li>For the first passage (p.0) make sure to use a separate 24-wells plate per patient sample since isolated crypts from primary intestinal material during the first passage are most susceptible to infections.</li>
<li>Keep the intestinal crypt pellet on ice.</li>
<li>Analyze the size of the pellet by eye to determine the appropriate volume of 50% matrigel.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Usually, 4–6 wells per biopsy is sufficient for p.0. However, a higher number of wells can be used if the crypt yield is very high (7–12 wells) or a lower number when the yield is low (1–3 wells).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>To ensure the crypt density is not too low, first resuspend the crypt pellet in 100 μl 50% matrigel.</li>
<li>Check the crypt density by plating a test droplet and view under the light microscope. Preferably do not plate out crypts too dense to allow for efficient (out)growth and proliferation of the structures. The ideal density is 15–20 crypts per 7.5 μL of matrigel drop.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> the crypt density can be adjusted according to the observations in the test droplet.</div>
<p>Too dense: If crypts are too densely seeded, dilute the sample in more matrigel and seed additional wells with the extra matrigel.</p>
<p>Too sparse: If crypts are too sparsely seeded, crypts can be centrifuged at 130 g 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in smaller volumes of matrigel to increase the density.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Prevent bubble formation during pipetting and plating.</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Plate 4∗ 7.5 μL of matrigel with about 15–20 crypts per drop of a (pre-warmed) 24-well plate.</li>
<li>Resuspend the matrigel after plating out 3 wells to ensure the crypts have not settled at the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube.</li>
<li>Incubate 30 min. at 37 °C.</li>
<li>Add 500 μL of pre-warmed CM +/+ with additional gentamicin (50 μg/mL) and vancomycin (50 μg/mL). An example of crypts directly after isolation can be found in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>.</li>

<h4>First Week of Culture</h4>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Crypts close quickly and start to proliferate (visible as “budding”) after several days (see <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>).</div>
<ol>
<li>Often check wells for infections. When any of the wells shows clear signs of infection, aspirate the medium from the well and add 1 mL ethanol for 30 s. Aspirate ethanol and matrigel drops and re-add 1 mL of ethanol for 30 s. Aspirate and leave well empty (important: leaving ethanol creates ethanol vapor in the plate, which leads to cell death in the other wells). This approach prevents cross contamination of other wells from this patient sample.</li>
<li>Refresh the wells with 500 μL colon organoid medium +/+ with additional gentamicin (50 μg/mL) and vancomycin (50 μg/mL) every 2–3 days (e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday). If crypts are isolated on a Friday, add 1 mL CM +/+ instead of 500 μL (with additional gentamicin and vancomycin) to ensure optimal growth during the weekend</li>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> FIS experiments should only be performed after a minimum of two passages after isolation.</div>
<h3>General Handling and Passaging of Human Colon Organoid Cultures</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼3 h</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Pre-warm 24- and 96-wells plates used for organoid culturing to 37 °C for a minimum of &gt;1 day. This is essential to ensure that after the colon organoids are plated, the matrigel polymerizes in the well efficiently and forms stable drops.</div>
<h4>Preparations</h4>
<ol>
<li>Prepare cold Ad-DF+++ and warm CM +/+.</li>
<li>Thaw (and keep) matrigel on ice or at 4 °C and dilute 1:1 with cold CM +/+ (= 50% matrigel).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> the splitting ratio should be usually 1:4–1:8 24-wells. If seven day old organoid cultures cannot be split according to this ratio because they have not proliferated sufficiently, check the medium quality or reseed organoids in 1:1 wells without disruption to allow more time to recover or proliferate until disruption.</div>
<h4>Passaging Colon Organoids</h4>
<ol>
<li>Discard the CM +/+ from the wells containing the colon organoids.</li>
<li>Detach the matrigel with the organoids by aspirating 1 mL Ad-DF+++ and forcefully dispensing the medium directly onto the matrigel drops in the well several times with a p1000 filter tip. If necessary gently scrape the well with the end of the pipet tip to detach residue.</li>
<li>Transfer the colon organoid suspension to a sterile 15 mL tube on ice. Several wells (up to 12) can be combined in the 1 mL.</li>
<li>Put a p200 tip (without filter) on top of a p1000 filter tip (see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>) and place the tip in the 1 mL organoid suspension on the bottom of the tube. Mechanically shear/disrupt the organoid structures by pipetting the 1 mL organoid suspension up and down 15–20 times through the p1000/ 200 tip combination. The organoids will be broken up into smaller parts. Resuspend with firm speed and fully take up and dispense the 1 mL suspension. Slow, mechanic shearing does not create efficient disruption. Minor foam formation is normal but try to prevent it by avoiding foam aspiration or dispension.</li>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> the colon organoid pellet is vulnerable and can be easily lost through aspiration of the supernatant. Be careful while aspirating the media: it is best to leave &gt; 50 μL of supernatant on the organoids to avoid pellet aspiration. Remove the last supernatant with a p200 tip.</div>
<h4>Plating Colon Organoids in 24-Well Plates</h4>
<ol>
<li>Resuspend the organoid pellet in an appropriate volume of 50% matrigel. The volume of matrigel needed is 30 μL per seeded well of a 24-wells plate assuming enough organoids have been passaged.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Example:</u> 2 wells of a 7-day old, good quality organoid culture can be split into approximately 8–16 new wells of a 24-wells plate. To avoid too sparsely seeded wells, it is advisable to first resuspend in a matrigel volume sufficient to seed 6 wells. Therefore, the pellet can be resuspended in approximately 180 μL of 50% matrigel. In case the organoids are too densely seeded, the organoid suspension can be diluted by adding more matrigel.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Check the number of organoids in a 10 μl test drop of matrigel by light microscopy, to decide if the organoid suspension should be further diluted (the density should be 15-30 structures per drop, see <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>B). Always recheck a new test drop after further dilution.</li>
<li>While preventing bubbles, plate 4∗ 7.5 μL matrigel with a p20 tip per well in a (pre-warmed) 24-well plate (see <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>A). Slightly tilting the plate helps to deposit the drops in the desired positions.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Organoid structures will quickly settle at the bottom of the tube within 30 s so frequently resuspend the organoid suspension with a p200. While resuspending keep the tube on ice to prevent the matrigel from solidifying in the tube.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Incubate the plate for 15–20 min at 37 °C.</li>
<li>Add 500 μL of pre-warmed of CM +/+ per well.</li>
<li>Incubate the organoid cultures for 7 days at 37 °C, CO<sub>2</sub> 5% and refresh the wells with 500 μL of CM +/ + per well, every 2–3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Human colon organoids can usually be passaged every 7 days. Therefore, it is important to regularly check the quality of the organoid cultures. Good quality organoid cultures show a stem cell phenotype which is characterized by efficient budding structures. For wild type (or very mild CF genotype) colon organoids a clear pre-swollen lumen can be seen with bright field imaging compared to colon organoids with a CF genotype where no lumen is visible (see <a href="#fig10">Figures 10</a>A and 10B).When colon organoids lose their stem cell phenotype (usually due to insufficient Wnt-3A activity in the WCM) the organoids appear as thick-walled, differentiated structures (see <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>C). These bad quality organoid cultures are not appropriate for CFTR-related experiments because this leads to unreliable results.</div>

<h3>Freezing Human Colon Organoid Cultures</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼2 h</div>
<p>Two different methods of organoids freezing are described here. First is freezing trypsinized human colon organoids after 1–3 days replating (Freezing protocol A). This is an efficient method to store source colon organoid samples in a master cell bank. Second is freezing small organoid structures directly after disruption (Freezing protocol B); this is a fast, timesaving and efficient procedure appropriate for storing a local working cell bank.</p>
<ol>
<li>Disrupt and freeze organoids when well is full (7–10 days cultured organoids)</li>
<li>Freeze one full well (of a 24-wells plate) per cryovial which should be sufficient to plate into 3–4 new wells after thawing.</li>
<li>Prepare cold Recovery™ Cell Culture Freezing Medium.</li>
<li>Prepare cold Ad-DF+++</li>
<li>Prepare ROCKi 10 mM stock.</li>
<li>Prepare warm CM +/+ with additional ROCKi 10 μM.</li>
<li>For freezing protocol A: thaw (and keep) matrigel on ice and dilute 1:1 with cold CM +/+ (= 50% matrigel)</li>
<li>Prepare 0.05% Trypsin EDTA to 18–23 ° C</li>
</ol>
<h4>Freezing Protocol A</h4>
<ol>
<li>Perform step 1–4 and 7,8 of ‘General handling and passaging of human colon organoid cultures’, part B.</li>
<li>Aspirate and discard the supernatant and add 4 mL of 0.05% Trypsin EDTA, and vortex for 30 s.</li>
<li>Put the tube in a warm water bath at 37 °C for 1 min and vortex vigorously for 30 s.</li>
<li>Inspect the solution in the tube by horizontally placing the tube on the light microscopy stage (4x objective), adjust focus so that organoids in solution are in visible. Observe the size of the organoid structures. If intact organoids are still visible put the tube in a warm water bath at 37 °C for an additional 1 min and vortex vigorously for 30 sec.</li>
<li>When the organoids are sufficiently disrupted (∼100 x smaller), add 8 mL of Ad-DF+++ to neutralize the trypsin and resuspend 10 times the organoid suspension.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the tube for 3 min at 450 <i>g</i> at 4 °C.</li>
<li>Aspirate and discard the supernatant and add the required amount of medium and matrigel to the organoid pellet.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For freezing, organoids must be seeded in a 1:1 ratio after trypsinization. Thus, 1 well of organoids from a 24-wells plate can be seeded into 1 new well of a 6-well tissue culture plate.</div>

<li>Add 2.5 mL of fresh CM +/+ + ROCKi in each 6-well plate well and transfer the plate to the incubator.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> 1–2 day old organoid cultures are ready to be frozen. This increases the efficiency of survival after thawing.</div>
<ol start="12">
<li>Detach the matrigel and organoids by aspirating 1 mL Ad-DF+++ and forcefully dispensing the medium directly onto the matrigel drops in the well several times with a p1000. If necessary gently scrape well with end of pipet tip to detach everything.</li>
<li>Transfer the organoid suspension to a sterile 15 mL tube.</li>
<li>Wash the wells with another 1 mL of Ad-DF+++ and transfer to the same 15 mL tube.</li>
<li>Fill up the 15 mL tube with with 12 mL of cold Ad-DF+++ and pipet up and down with a 5 mL pipet.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the suspension for 3 min at 450 <i>g</i> at 4 °C, remove the supernatant and keep the pellet.</li>

<li>After 24 h, transfer the cryovials for storage in liquid nitrogen.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Freezing Protocol B</h4>
<ol>
<li>Perform step 1–4 and 7,8 of ‘General handling and passaging of human colon organoid cultures’, part B. However, shear/ disrupt the colon organoids 30–35 times to create even smaller organoid structures.</li>

<li>Gently mix the suspension and centrifuge 450 <i>g</i> for 5 min at 4 °C.</li>
<li>Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 100 μL of 50% matrigel.</li>
<li>Check the organoid density under the microscope by seeding a 7.5 μL matrigel test drop. The matrigel drop should contain &gt;100 structures of very small colon organoid structures. Organoids frozen according to freezing protocol A should be thawed and seeded with higher density due to the smaller sized structures compared to protocol B. To ensure optimal outgrowth and budding of the colon organoid structures it is suggested to seed multiple densities to cover the most optimal density for recovery and proliferation.</li>
<li>Plate 4∗ 7.5 μL matrigel drops without bubbles to a single well of a (pre-warmed) 24-wells tissue culture plate. Usually one cryovial should contain enough organoids to seed in 3–4 wells.</li>
<li>Dilute the remaining colon organoid suspension 1:1 with matrigel and plate two additional wells.</li>

<li>Check the organoid density under the microscope: seed the organoid structures with a 10%–20% higher density compared to organoids already in culture, aiming for 50–70 structures per drop (10%–20% of the structures are usually not viable). Organoids frozen according to freezing protocol B should be thawed and seeded with lower density due to the larger sized structures compared to protocol A.</li>
<li>Plate 4∗ 7.5 μL matrigel drops without bubbles per single well of a (pre-warmed) 24-wells tissue culture plate. Usually one cryovial should contain enough organoids to seed in 3–4 wells.

<h3>Forskolin Induced Swelling (FIS) Assay</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼5 h</div>
<p>The FIS assay was developed to measure CFTR function in human colon organoids. Upon forskolin (fsk) stimulation (which indirectly activates CFTR through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)), CFTR function can be assessed by observing the subsequent swelling of human colon organoids. Organoid swelling occurs through chloride excretion into the organoid lumen and osmosis. The assay can determine residual CFTR function and the effect of CFTR modulators (<a href="#bib4">Dekkers et al., 2013</a>, <a href="#bib1">Boj et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Pre-warm 24- and 96-wells plates used for organoid culturing to 37 °C for a minimum of &gt;1 day. This is essential to ensure that after the colon organoids are plated, the matrigel polymerizes in the well efficiently and forms stable drops.</div>
<h4>Preparations</h4>
<ol>
<li>Incubate 96-well plates at 37 °C &gt; 7 days. It is important to have warm plates to prevent dislodging of matrigel drops.</li>
<li>Prepare cold Ad-DF+++.</li>
<li>Thaw (and keep) matrigel on ice and dilute 1:1 with cold CM +/+ (= 50% matrigel).</li>
<li>Prepare warm CM +/ +.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Plating Human Colon Organoids (Day 1)</h4>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Some CFTR modulators (e.g. correctors) require longer periods incubation. Example: correctors VX-809 and VX-661 require 24 h incubation and are added directly to the CM +/+ on the day of the organoid plating, whereas potentiator (e.g. VX-770) should be added directly before the FIS measurement. Take this into account when CM +/+ is added. See ‘European FIS validation &amp; standardization protocol’ for corrector preparations.</div>
<ol>
<li>Perform step 1-9 of ‘General handling and passaging of human colon organoid cultures’, part B.</li>
<li>Resuspend the organoid pellet in 50% matrigel (plating volume = 4 μL ∗ amount of wells + 50 μL)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>With good quality organoid cultures, one full well of organoids from a 24-wells plate can be seeded into 10–20 wells of a 96-wells plate</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: 8 wells of a 7-day, good quality organoid culture can be split and seeded into ∼80–160 wells of a 96-wells flat bottom plate. To avoid too sparsely seeded wells, it is advisable to first resuspend in a matrigel volume sufficient to seed 80 wells. Therefore, the organoid pellet can be resuspended in approximately 370 (80∗4 + 50) μL of 50% matrigel. In case the organoids are too densely seeded, organoids can be diluted by adding more matrigel.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Check the amount of organoids in a 4 μL test drop of matrigel under a light microscope, to determine whether the organoid suspension should be further diluted (the density should be 30–50 structures per drop). Always recheck a new test drop after further dilution.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> when the organoid density is too low, matrigel can be resuspended in 10 mL of Ad-DF+++ and centrifuged at 130 g for 5 min at 4 °C. Next, aspirate medium and resuspend the organoid pellet in less matrigel.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Transfer the organoid suspension to a cold microcentrifuge tube.</li>
<li>While preventing bubbles add a 4 μL drop to a (warm) flat-bottom 96-well plate (see <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>). This can be performed with a regular p20 pipet.</li>

</ol>
<p>Example: if the desired final concentration of fsk within the well is 5 μM, prepare a fsk dilution of 10 μM. If 50 μL of 10 μM fsk is then added to the 50 μL CM +/+, the final concentration will be 5 μM.</p>

<h3>European FIS Validation &amp; Standardization Protocol</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼ 8 weeks</div>
<p>To ensure correct implementation of the human organoid technology and the application in the FIS assay, six reference human colon organoid lines (covering different classes of CFTR mutations from severe to mild -see <a href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>). These organoids lines were tested for basal CFTR function and specific drug response to available CFTR modulators (VX-661 and VX-770). Based on the following protocol, swelling data (technical duplicates at three time points with weekly intervals (n=3)) were generated to compare the qualitative and quantitative results of the implemented organoid technology and FIS assay (not yet published data). These reference organoid lines were selected based on prevalent CFTR genotypes (see <a href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>) and differences in CFTR basal function and response to CFTR modulators. Researchers that follow the detailed work instructions presented in this protocol should find identical or highly reproducible results (within 10% of AUC values, not yet published data) for these reference lines to confirm successful implementation of the human intestinal organoid technology and FIS assay.</p>

<h3>General Experimental Set Up</h3>
<p>The FIS validation assay is based on the experimental set up as previously performed and described (<a href="#bib3">Dekkers et al., 2016</a>, Science; <a href="#bib1">Boj et al., 2017</a>, Jove).</p>
<ol>
<li>Each reference organoid line was tested using four different conditions (basal CFTR function, VX-661; VX- 770 and VX-661 + VX-770, each in combination with 8 different fsk concentrations (0.008; 0.02; 0.05; 0.128; 0.32; 0.8; 2 or 5 μM) which results in 32 different experimental conditions.</li>
<li>Biological replicates for each condition were measured in duplicate and experiments were repeated n=3.</li>
<li>Human colon organoids were plated in a 96-well plate as schematically depicted in <a href="#tbl5">Table 5</a>.</li>

<li>Per 96-well plate add 9.6 μL of 1 mM VX-661 to 3 mL of CM+/+ creating a final concentration of 3.2 μM.</li>
<li>Add 50 μL to each well that requires 24 h of VX-661 incubation (see <a href="#tbl5">Table 5</a> for plate lay out)</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected Outcomes</h2>
<p>Sometimes after 3–4 days the colon organoid concentration will be so dense that it is advisable to reseed the structures from 1 well into 3–4 new wells of a 24-wells plate. Take up the small organoids in 1 mL Ad-DF+++ in a microcentrifuge tube, centrifuge at a table top centrifuge and directly plate out in 100 μL fresh matrigel into 3–4 new wells of a 24-wells plate. This allows the small organoid structures to have more space to expand and start budding before they are ready for the first mechanical disruption/ shearing of the organoids.</p>
<p>After 7 days some organoid structures are already efficiently budding and ready for mechanical disruption for splitting. When organoid structures are still very small and not yet efficiently proliferating but the matrigel is fading: do not yet disrupt but take up the small organoids from four wells in 1 mL Ad-DF+++ in a microcentrifuge tube, centrifuge with a table top microcentrifuge and plate the organoids into 100–120 μL of fresh matrigel into 3-4 new wells of a 24-wells plate. This allows the small organoid structures to have more time to expand and start budding before they are ready for the first mechanical disruption/shearing of the organoids.</p>

<h3>Raw Image Data Software Analysis</h3>
<p>The goal of this procedure is to quantify the relative increase in total organoid area (organoid swelling) after stimulation of CFTR function by fsk. The raw data of the FIS assay consists of the confocal images of calcein green stained organoids that are generated at 10 min intervals, which are digitally stored as a time-series-clip of each well (see <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>). Image analysis software (e.g. Zen blue (Zeiss), Cell profiler (open-source)) is used to identify the perimeter of each closed organoid structure (X,Y plane), which is defined as a confined region-of-interest. The image software is set to ‘fill objects’ (region-of-interest). Each region-of-interest is expressed as area μm<sup>2</sup> per time point per well. Total area μm<sup>2</sup> associated with all regions-of-interest (organoids) per time point per well is calculated and compared to t = 0 min.</p>

<h3>Calculations from Raw Analysis FIS Data in Excel</h3>
<p>Exported data from imaging software is further processed and calculated in Excel. Data is transposed and calculated in a pre-set format according to the linear trapezoidal method that calculates the average increase over a given time window that is multiplied by the time units within the interval. First, the relative increase over time in area μm<sup>2</sup> per well derived from the exported data is normalized per well to time point 0. Time point 0 is set to 100% and time point 10–60 min are normalized accordingly (see <a href="#tbl8">Table 8</a>, example for 8 measured wells with 4 different conditions; time clips are presented as columns). The relative increase in swelling per well is now expressed in percentages creating 7 data points per well, which can be expressed to show swelling increase per well in time. To more condensely express swelling data (e.g. various forskolin concentrations) in one graph, the area under the curve (AUC) of the relative increase of swelling per well over 60 min can be calculated to create a single data point per well. By using the AUC values, the large datasets can be condensed into graphs capturing all data (see example data in <a href="#tbl8">Table 8</a> &amp; <a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a>). A specific image analysis and data processing pipeline for the FIS assay in open source software is in development by Hagemeijer and Botelho (unpublished).</p>

<p>(A) Raw data (area μm2 per well per time point) can be normalized to time point 0 min. Normalized data depicted in a graph shows relative increase in swelling per well over time (baseline is set to 100%). Here, duplicate wells are measured for swelling at 0.02; 0.128; 0.8 and 5 μM fsk for 60 min.</p>
<p>(B) The AUC of relative increase in swelling is calculated in Excel.</p>
<p>(C) Using AUC calculations for the different conditions, a condensed graph can be created which represents overall relative swelling data per condition over 60 min. Graph C shows the average AUC data of the duplicate wells (from B) with SD.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol aims to provide detailed descriptions on how to establish viable human colon organoid cultures and to reproducible FIS results. The quality and fast processing of rectal biopsies is crucial for successful isolation of stem cell crypts. Despite detailed protocols, quality of the colon organoid media can vary between batches and operators and is mainly caused by the variation in self-produced conditioned media like WCM and NCM. Currently, the activity of essential components such as Wnt-3A and Noggin can be assessed in quantitative assays but organoid responses to these factors may not fully be represented by cell-line based reporter assays which can affect the quality of the colon organoid cultures and outcome of FIS results. Therefore, pictures and examples are included in this protocol to provide guidance for the researcher and allow ongoing monitoring of human colon organoid culture quality and to compare FIS data. Various microscopy platforms can be used, but robustness of FIS data is highly dependent on the quality of the fluorescent images, and especially a low signal to noise ratio leads to unreliable data analysis and non-representative results. Therefore, optimized confocal microscopic procedures and efficient imaging software analysis are needed to ensure capturing high-quality images and calculation of FIS AUC.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>When organoid structures are still very small and not yet efficiently proliferating but the matrigel is fading</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Do not yet disrupt the culture but take up the small organoids from four wells in 1 mL Ad-DF+++ in a microcentrifuge tube, centrifuge with a table top microcentrifuge and plate the organoids into 100 –120 μL of fresh matrigel into 3–4 new wells of a 24-wells plate. This allows the small organoid structures to have more time to expand and start budding before they are ready for the first mechanical disruption/ shearing of the organoids.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>No crypts can be found after the total isolation procedure is performed on the biopsies.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>This is usually caused by a bad quality of biopsies (only superficial tissue removal) or too much time passing between the biopsy removal and the start of the crypt isolation procedure. In this case the colon biopsies can also be plated out directly in a 24-well in 250 μL 50% matrigel and addition of 1 mL CM +/+ (with additional genta- and vancomycin). Sometimes intestinal crypts might still emerge directly from the biopsy.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Organoids are too densely seeded</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Dilute the sample in more matrigel and seed additional wells</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Organoids are too sparsely seeded</p>
<h3>Potential solution</h3>
<p>Add cold Ad-DF+++ to the organoids, centrifuged at 130 g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspend in smaller volumes of matrigel with increased density.</p>
