<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Humoral immune responses depend on the generation of high-affinity antigen-specific antibodies. Germinal center (GC) B cells are the cornerstone of this response in peripheral lymphoid organs. High purities of GC B cells, and also naive B cells, are required for accurate analysis in downstream assays to yield essential knowledge on immunity. This protocol lays out quick and easy steps to purify GC B cells from spleens of immunized mice or B cells from naive animals by negative selection using MACS.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Ramezani-Rad et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol below describes the specific steps for purifying untouched (=unlabeled) B cells or germinal center (GC) B cells from mouse spleens using Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting (MACS). Here, B cells are robustly enriched by depleting CD43-expressing cell populations, which is not expressed on conventional mature B cells. GC B cells are enriched by depleting cell populations that express CD43, CD38, and CD11c. GCs form in peripheral lymphoid organs during an immune response and the formation of mature GCs takes several days post antigen exposure. In the mammalian experimental model <i>Mus musculus</i> (mouse) this response can be elicited by injection of a T cell-dependent antigen. In this protocol the steps are optimized for the immunogen sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), however this protocol is generally applicable to other T cell-dependent antigens. Furthermore, this protocol was established utilizing C57BL/6 mice and may be applicable to other mouse strains. Female and male mice over 6 weeks of age are suitable for this protocol. Please note that this purification method applies specifically to murine GC B cells, as human GC B cells express CD38 and cannot be purified using this method.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This protocol has been optimized for speed and simplicity. Certain steps may be different from the manufacturer’s recommendation.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The purification of naive B cells is included in the workflow of GC B cell purification. If only naive B cells are desired, omit immunization of animals and start directly from the spleen harvest (from naive animals) until completion of the B cell purification step (CD43-depletion) as outlined in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparation of immunogen (SRBCs)</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 20 min</div>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 1–2 × 10<sup>8</sup> SRBCs in 100 μL PBS per injection into each animal.
<ol type="a">
<li>In a laminar flow hood under aseptic conditions, aspirate 1 mL of citrated SRBCs (18-gauge needle with 1-mL syringe) into a 50-mL conical tube. Invert bottle several times before aspiration.</li>
<li>Fill tube to 50 mL with cold PBS and spin at 800 × <i>g</i> for 6 min at 4°C to wash the cells.
<ol type="i">
<li>Aspirate supernatant without disturbing the pellet.</li>
<li>Repeat wash as in step 1b.</li>
<li>Supernatant should be relatively clear after two washes. However, an additional wash may be required.</li>
<li>Resuspend SRBC pellet with cold PBS to 4 mL total volume (add for this ∼3.5 mL PBS) and count this solution to ensure cell number is around 1–2 × 10<sup>9</sup> per mL (=1–2 × 10<sup>8</sup> in a 100 μL injection dose).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> SRBCs should be prepared just before the injections and used right away. Citrated SRBC batches should be used within a month post draw date. Utilization at later time points may require additional washes and can lead to lower immune responses.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Total B cell purification (CD43-depletion) should result in purities &gt; 95% (95%–98%) yielding ∼15–35 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per spleen. The purified B cell number is roughly half of the initial total white blood cell number. After immunization (7 days), the expected range of purity for GC B cells is 85%–91% (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) and the expected yield is ∼0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per spleen.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol works best when robust GC responses are induced. Generally, best results are achieved at the peak of the GC response. Early or late GC B cells may not be as efficiently purified using this protocol. Relatedly, when using experimental animals where GC responses are compromised (such as knockout animals in essential genes of the GC response), the purity and yield may be reduced.</p>
<p>The use of MACS in this protocol can achieve high purities for naive B cells comparable to purification by FACS. The GC B cell purities in this protocol are high, albeit they are lower than FACS purities. Purification by FACS is required in situations where the highest purities of GC B cells or sorting of GC B cell subpopulations (i.e., light zone or dark zone GC B cells) are desired. However, in some instances the enrichment by MACS can complement FACS to aid in faster sorting times.</p>
<p>For simplicity and efficiency, untouched naive B cells or GC B cells are purified from naive or immunized mice, respectively. If untouched B cells are required from the same mouse from which untouched GC B cells are purified, please refer to (<a href="#bib1">Cato et al., 2011</a>) for details.</p>
<p>The spleen is the largest peripheral lymphoid organ hosting a high quantity of B cells including GC B cells upon immunization. Therefore, the spleen is an ideal source for the purification of these cell populations. Lymph nodes also host B cells and GC B cells, but are smaller in size and thus can be more challenging to efficiently purify GC B cells for a wide array of downstream assays.</p>
<p>This protocol can yield sufficient GC B cell numbers for many downstream assays including genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic analysis. The purified GC B cell numbers would also allow for certain proteomic analyses and some functional assays. The need of high GC B cell numbers for certain experimental assays (such as immunoblotting) can require large numbers of mice. However, experimental animals need to be used ethically and animal numbers should be reduced wherever possible. A reasonable alternative can be <i>in vitro</i>-derived GC B cells (originally described by (<a href="#bib2">Nojima et al., 2011</a>)). These cells recapitulate some major functions of <i>in vivo</i>-derived GC B cells and can be investigated without the need of large animal numbers. Starting with 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> naive B cells can yield &gt; 50 × 10<sup>6</sup> <i>in vitro</i>-derived GC B cells after a few days. New observations tested in these cells can then be validated in purified <i>in vivo</i>-derived GC B cells as previously outlined (<a href="#bib3">Ramezani-Rad et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>No GC/immune reaction is observed</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The GC B cell percentage after SRBC immunization in wild-type mice should be &gt; 4% (within the B cell gate) on day 7 post-immunization. SRBCs should be used as close as possible to the draw date. Renew SRBC batch if response is low. Intravenous injection can lead to more robust responses in the spleen compared to intraperitoneal injection.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Low cell viability</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The following aspects are critical to ensure high cell viability:</p>
<ul>
<li>GC B cells are more fragile than naive B cell population. On the day of the spleen harvest, work fast and keep cells cold throughout the procedures.</li>
<li>Gently dissociate spleen, do not use excessive force during dissociation, which can lead to cell death.
<ul>
<li>This protocol uses mechanical dissociation due to the advantages over enzymatic dissociation associated specifically for this protocol. Mechanical dissociation of spleens can sufficiently liberate lymphocytes, avoids enzymatic reactions (i.e., collagenase), which can affect surface molecules, and most importantly is much quicker and therefore easier to utilize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During red blood cell lysis, do not incubate cells in ACK buffer longer than indicated as this can decrease the viability of B cells.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Cells do not pass the column/column is clogged</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Columns can clog due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overloading the column with too many cells. LS columns allow for up to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> labeled cells to bind to the column.</li>
<li>Cell clumps obstruct the column. Ensure cell suspensions are filtered properly and no clumps are visible.</li>
<li>Air bubbles in the column. Carefully load the cells and the MACS buffer onto the column avoiding the introduction of air bubbles into the column. Degas MACS buffer before use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Low GC B cell purity</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are potentially several underlying problems for this to occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the immunogen induces robust GC responses (see also <a href="#sec6.1">Problem 1</a>).</li>
<li>Ensure red blood cell lysis works efficiently to avoid carryover of red blood cell impurities.</li>
<li>For novice users, ensure the B cell purification step works efficiently and thus all other MACS steps including reagents, work flawlessly. B cell enrichment (CD43-depletion) purity needs to be at least 95% to fall within the acceptable GC B cell purity range (see <a href="#expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</a>). Lower purities of total B cell purification will carryover the impurities and affect GC B cell purity.</li>
<li>Make sure correct antibody clones and concentrations are used.</li>
<li>The use of CD43, CD38, and CD11c antibodies should be sufficient for high GC B cell purities. However, impurities may be (further) decreased by addition of low concentrations (0.01 μg per 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells) of anti-Ter119-biotin, anti-Gr1-biotin, and/or anti-CD138-biotin. Additional use of antibodies can however affect the yield.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Low GC B cell yield</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Proper (yet gentle) dissociation of spleens is paramount for maximum cell recovery. Optionally, combine spleens up to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells for greater GC B cell number. Generally, no more than two spleens should be combined for GC B cell purification. Alternatively, samples can be pooled after GC B cell purification.</p>
