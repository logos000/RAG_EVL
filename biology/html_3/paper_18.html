<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Melanocytes, derived from neural crest cells, are involved in melanin production. This protocol describes a method to generate induced melanocytes (iMelanocytes) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using a suspension culture system, which considerably improves the differentiation efficiency. The most critical parts of this protocol are the selection of a reliable iPSC line with strong potential to differentiate into melanocytes and their stemness maintenance.</p>
<p>For complete information on the use and generation of this protocol, please refer to our <i>Cell Reports</i> article, <a href="#bib5">Liu el al. (2019)</a>.</p>
<div class="highlights">
<h3>Highlights</h3>

<h3>Selection of iPSC Lines</h3>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Some iPSC Lines Have No or Low Potential to Differentiate into Melanocytes</div>
<p>Different cellular morphologies (a–c) can be observed during the process of differentiation (week 3, before single cell dissociation), such as typical epithelium-like (a, cobblestone morphology), fibroblast-like (b, bipolar or multipolar with elongated shapes) or neuron-like cells (c, with long thin axon). Although limited melanocyte-like cells could be found sometimes by week three (d, e, arrows), they fail to proliferate after single-cell dissociation (f, arrows). Arrows: melanocyte-like cells. Scale bar: 200 μm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For researchers who lack experience in this aspect, it is best to start with a standard cell line, such as hES H9, which has a robust ability to differentiate into melanocytes (<a href="#bib1">Fang et al., 2006</a>).</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> iPSC clone 201B7 (<a href="#bib7">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>, <a href="#bib3">Hosaka et al., 2019</a>) and WTc11 (<a href="https://www.coriell.org/0/Sections/Search/Sample_Detail.aspx?Ref=GM25256">https://www.coriell.org/0/Sections/Search/Sample_Detail.aspx?Ref=GM25256</a>) can be used as alternatives if hES cells are unavailable.</div>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Select an iPSC line through evaluation of the formation of EBs (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>C and 2D), or through the detection the expression of specific markers, such as SALL3 at day 7 of EB formation, to predict the potential of differentiation into melanocytes (<a href="#bib2">Guo et al., 2019</a>).</div>

<h3>Melanocyte Differentiation</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼5–6 weeks</div>
<p>This step generates iMelanocytes from EBs; it takes about 5–6 weeks to generate fully differentiated iMelanocytes.</p>

<li>Replace half of the medium every 2–3 days.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Single Cell Dissociation</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼30 min</div>
<p>At week 3 of differentiation, the density of iMelanocytes is very high (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>D–4F), and they need to be dissociated into single cells and passaged (late stage).</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare fibronectin-coated plate (refer to Before you Begin, Fibronectin-coated plate) at least 1 h ahead of single cell dissociation.</li>
<li>Aspirate and discard the culture medium. Gently wash the cells with DPBS.</li>
<li>For each well of a 6-well plate, add 600 μL TrypLE Express Enzyme and ensure complete coverage of cells.</li>
<li>Incubate for 2–3 min at 15–25°C. Frequently observe the cell morphology using an inverted microscope.</li>

</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Commercial melanocyte medium, such as HEM 2201, is <u>not suggested</u> for the late stage culture as it cannot maintain iMelanocytes as long as the differentiation medium and usually leads to senescence.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> iMelanocytes need to be plated at a relatively higher density (1.5–2 ×10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> is recommended) than normal human epidermal melanocytes (usually 1×10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>), otherwise the proliferative ability decreases.</div>
<h3>Passage of iMelanocytes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼30 min</div>
<p>After single cell dissociation, epithelium-like cells and/or undifferentiated cells can initially be observed. Compared to iMelanocytes, it usually takes longer for these cells to become detached. As a result, differential dissociation can be used to purify iMelanocytes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare fibronectin-coated plates (refer to Before you Begin, Fibronectin-Coated Plate) at least 1 h ahead of single cell dissociation.</li>
<li>When the cells reach 90% confluence, aspirate and discard the culture medium.</li>

<li>For 60 mm dishes, add 600 μL TrypLE Express Enzyme and ensure complete coverage of cells.</li>
<li>Incubate for 1–2 min at 15–25°C. Keep observing the cell morphology using an inverted microscope.</li>
<li>When iMelanocytes form a round shape, gently tap the flask to detach the cells. (The epithelium-like cells and undifferentiated cells usually have not become round at this stage.)</li>
<li>Add 2 mL DMEM (low glucose) to dilute the enzyme and avoid pipetting the bottom of the well.</li>
<li>Transfer the entire suspension to a 15 mL conical tube.</li>
<li>Wash the plate with fresh 2 mL DMEM to collect the residual cells, avoid pipetting the bottom of the well, and combine with the previous suspension.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the cells for 5 min at 300 × <i>g</i> at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.</li>
<li>Resuspend the pellet with melanocyte differentiation medium (supplemented with 0.5% FBS and without TPA).</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes-and-quality-control">Expected Outcomes &amp; Quality Control</h2>
<h3>Morphology</h3>
<p>The most convenient method to identify the generation of iMelanocytes is through observation of cellular morphology. Dendritic cells can be observed when they attach to fibronectin-coated plates at week two (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A) and the dendrites become more and more typical (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B), especially after single-cell dissociation (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). Healthy iMelanocytes are robust cells as indicated by quick proliferation capability and clear cellular morphology (<a href="#fig4">&gt;Figures 4</a>D–4F and<a href="#fig5">5</a>A–5C) even after single-cell dissociation (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). In addition, the color of cell pellet also darkens gradually with passages, becoming notably dark by week 5-6, representing melanocyte maturation.</p>
<figure id="fig5"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/18-Fig5.jpg" alt="Fig5.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 5. Changes in Cellular Morphology during Differentiation</div>
<p>Cells with short dendrites can be found when they attach to fibronectin-coated plates (week 2, a), and these dendrites become longer one week later (week 3, b) and more typical after single cell dissociation (week 5, c). Scale bar: 200 μm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Melanocyte Markers</h3>
<p>Melanocyte markers such as PAX3, SOX10, and MITF are expressed as early as the first week of differentiation, which can be detected by both real-time PCR (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) and immunofluorescence staining (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). Expression of these markers steadily increases as differentiation progresses. If the proper iPSC line is identified and their stemness is well maintained, the percentage of PAX3-positive cells can reach 79.5 ± 13.7% by week two. Significant expression of markers such as TYR, TYRP1, and DCT, is often detected by week three (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a> and <a href="#fig7">7</a>).</p>

<p>PAX3, MITF and SOX10 expression is detected by one week post-differentiation while TYRP1 is not expressed until week three. Scale bar: 100 μm</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Other Evaluations</h3>
<p>DOPA staining and Masson-Fontana staining, can be used to detect the activity of tyrosinase and melanin production, respectively. In addition, the generation of melanosomes can be detected using transmission electron microscopy; however, the procedure is more complicated than the above methods. It is recommended that these evaluations be performed after week 5 of differentiation, when iMelanocytes become fully differentiated and will produce positive results.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Even when all the steps in the above protocol are strictly followed, melanocyte differentiation remains unstable because maintaining the stemness of iPSCs is quite difficult. This is especially true for feeder-free conditions, which requires adequate experience and a good knowledge of cell culture.</p>
<p>The use of iPSCs maintained under feeder-free conditions beyond 20 passages is not recommended (there are no strict limits for this, due to the variability among different iPSC lines). Cultures extended beyond 20 passages must be used with caution. The differentiation capability and karyotype must be checked for cells that are past 20 passages under feeder-free conditions.</p>
<p>This protocol generates a heterogeneous population of melanocytes, with cells maturing at different rates (<a href="#bib5">Liu et al., 2019</a>). The isolation and culture of melanocytic stem cells (MelSCs) are not addressed in our protocol, although these cells can be detected during the differentiation and transplantation in the mouse model. Considering the critical role of MelSCs, identifying markers, isolation procedures and niche regulatory factors may provide a novel potential therapeutic option for patients with pigmentary disorders or hair graying (<a href="#bib4">Lee and Fisher, 2014</a>). Note that the use of alternative brands of feeder-free medium with this protocol has not been tested.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Potential Problem 1</h3>
<p>During the suspension culture, EBs fail to form a smooth and bright boundary (<a href="#fig8">Figures 8</a>A–8C). Even though typical melanocyte-like cells are found after attachment to fibronectin-coated plates, massive cell death will occur when they proliferate too quickly. They are characterized by unclear edges, aggregation and a yellow-brown color (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>D, arrows) followed by detachment after 1–2 days (<a href="#fig8">Figures 8</a>E and 8F, arrows).</p>
<figure id="fig8"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/18-Fig8.jpg" alt="Fig8.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 8. Failure in iMelanocyte Differentiation</div>
<p>EBs become blurry (a), show cavities (b) or break into debris (c, arrows) during the suspension culture differentiation. After attachment at week 2, even typical melanocyte-like cells could be found in some colonies (d), massive cell death will occur which are characterized by unclear edges, aggregation and a yellow-brown color (d, arrows) followed by detachment after 1–2 days (e, f, arrows). Scale bar: 200 μm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
<p>It is critical to choose undifferentiated iPSCs that are well maintained under MEF-based condition or feeder-free condition with a low passage number. If these problems occur, it is better to thaw early-passage iPSCs, which are stored in liquid nitrogen, and start from Section 2 (iPSC PREPARATION) again. For inexperienced researchers, selection of iPSCs maintained on MEFs is recommended.</p>
<h3>Potential Problem 2</h3>
<p>No significant melanocyte-like cells can be found, or their number is very limited, after attachment to fibronectin-coated plates (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>)</p>
<h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
<p>Selection or screening of proper cell lines for melanocyte differentiation is important because different iPSC lines show different potentials. If this problem occurs, it is suggested to choose another iPSC line; it is recommended that an established cell line is used, e.g., hES H9, that has confirmed potential for melanocyte differentiation.</p>
