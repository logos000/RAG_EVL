        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>The discovery of potent cell-permeable E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands can significantly facilitate the
            development of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs). Here, we present a protocol to determine the
            binding affinity of ligands toward CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase, using a cellular target engagement mechanism
            and in-cell ELISA assay. This protocol is easy to establish, with relatively low cost and rapid time frame.
            It can also be modified to measure the level of other proteins or determine the ligand affinity toward other
            E3s.</p>
        <p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib5">Yang et al.

            multiple-well plate; (2) orbital plate shaker (e.g., IKA MTS 2/4 digital microtiter shaker, ID # 0003208001)
            for application at temperature ranging from 0 to 23°C; (3) vacuum for removal of solutions; (4) plate reader
            (e.g., BMG LABTECH FLUOstar Omega microplate reader) capable to read optical density. The cell culture plate
            is the key platform to perform cell seeding, drug treatment, and in-cell ELISA assay. Tissue-culture (TC)
            treated 96-well plate is recommended. We have used Falcon 96-well Clear Flat Bottom TC-treated Culture
            Microplate (with lid, individually wrapped, sterile, cat # 353072) and it works well for this type of assay.

        <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
        <p>This protocol describes a platform specific to measure the binding affinity of CRBN E3 ligand(s). However, it
            has not been tested or optimized for other systems such as VHL E3 ligase and ligand. If needed, optimization
            will need to be performed.</p>
        <p>This protocol is based on the readout of HDAC6 protein level, which is relatively abundant among different
            cell lines, e.g., MM1S and Jurkat, and cellular target engagement mechanism. We also tried to apply it to
            the A431 cell line. Although the HDAC6 can still be measured, there was no expected result observed from
            target engagement. It indicated that different cellular environments may affect the target engagement
            mechanism. Thus, when this protocol needs to be applied to other cell lines, optimization will need to be
            performed.</p>
        <p>This is a cell-based activity test, thus the effects of cell permeability of the tested compounds have not
            been excluded on the final result. The corresponding cell permeability measurement of tested compound is
            recommended to be performed.</p>

        <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
        <h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
        <p>Significant number of cells are detached from well bottom (steps 13–15, steps 17–21).</p>
        <h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
        <p>It may be a result of failure of fixation or over washing. After completing the fixation, carefully handle
            the plate after spinning down the cells. Accidentally bumping the plate into other objects may resuspend the
            cells and increase the possibility of resuspending them again during addition of fixation solution. When
            adding the fixation solution, add the solution by contacting the well wall instead of directly adding to the
            medium and try to add it as slowly as possible. When performing the washing steps, add the buffer by
            contacting the well wall instead of directly adding to the cells.</p>
        <h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
        <p>ELISA signal is generally low (steps 43–46).</p>
        <h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
        <p>Check the quality or usage of critical reagent or materials, such as primary antibody solution and TMB
            substrate set, by orthogonal method such as western blot. Increase the incubation time (e.g., 1–2 h) or
            temperature (e.g., 37°C) after addition of TMB substrate mixture.</p>
        <h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
        <p>High background signal (steps 43–46).</p>
        <h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
        <p>It is generally due to inefficient washing of secondary antibody solution or contamination of secondary
            antibody to assay supplies such as tips and reagent reservoir. Increase the washing times after secondary
            antibody incubation. Change tips and reagent reservoir between each step.</p>
