<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A growing number of studies show that innate immune cells can undergo functional reprogramming, facilitating a faster and enhanced response to heterologous secondary stimuli. This concept has been termed “trained immunity.” We outline here a protocol to recapitulate this <i>in vitro</i> using adherent monocytes from consecutive isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The induction of trained immunity and the associated functional reprogramming of monocytes is described in detail using β-glucan (from <i>Candida albicans</i>) and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin as examples.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib4">Repnik et al. (2003)</a> and <a href="#bib1">Bekkering et al. (2016)</a>.</p>

<span class="timing-(day-0)-title">Timing (Day 0):</span> 2 h approximately</div>
<p>By using buffy coats it is possible to obtain large numbers of cells from the same donor. In a buffy coat the white blood cells of 500 mL of whole blood are concentrated into 50 mL. Different subsets of blood cells have different densities. This property is used to separate the fraction containing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the rest of the blood. When Ficoll-Paque is pipetted underneath the whole blood, the centrifugation process allows cells with a high density to migrate through the density gradient while cells with a lower density, such as PBMCs, remain on top of the gradient and can be easily collected (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The protocols of separation of PBMCs and monocytes from whole blood using density gradients are further described by Repnik et al. (<a href="#bib4">Repnik et al., 2003</a>).</p>

<span class="timing-(day-0)-title">Timing (Day 0):</span> 2 h approximately</div>
<p>After Ficoll-Paque isolation of monocytes and lymphocytes, it is possible to separate monocytes from lymphocytes by using a hyper-osmotic density gradient medium; Percoll. Separation of the two cell types is feasible since lymphocytes are more sensitive to an increase in osmolarity than monocytes.</p>
<p>For this step, prepare hyper-osmotic Percoll solution in advance: For 100 mL of solution, mix 48.5 mL of Percoll, 41.5 mL of sterile water and 10.0 mL of 0.22 μm filter-sterilized 1.6 M NaCl and shake vigorously.</p>

</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Different incubation times and starting cell amounts might be considered depending on the final read-out (FACS, qPCR, ELISA). When new stimuli are tested, there should be an extra step at day 7 to evaluate the live cell numbers per well to normalize the cytokine results to the cell numbers:</div>
<h4 id="sec2.1.1">Counting live cells with trypan blue</h4>
<p>Cells can be detached from the well by incubating them with cold PBS with 2 mM EDTA for 10 min at 4°C. After this, the cells can be collected from the well by pipetting. Dilute the cells 1:5 with Trypan Blue and count the cells non-stained in blue in a hemocytometer.</p>
<h4 id="sec2.1.2">Assessing cytotoxicity</h4>
<p>If the numbers of cells are different, the cytokine production for that stimulus should be normalized per cell number. LDH cytotoxicity assay needs to be performed with fresh supernatants (not frozen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The LDH cytotoxicity assay should include per cell type and concentration a positive control of cell lysis and a negative control (medium control), in order to calculate the percentage of cytotoxicity. A difference lower than 10% cytotoxicity between the conditions can be considered as acceptable.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Day 7 or later: Assessment of cytokine levels by ELISA.<br> Perform ELISA following the instructions of the manufacturer. The concentration of cytokines in the supernatant is usually above the detection limit of the commercial kits, so the samples need to be diluted in the dilution buffer specified by the manufacturer. For R&amp;D Duoset ELISA kits, the dilution range of the supernatants from monocytes trained with β-glucan or BCG and restimulated with LPS at day 6 is 10×–20× dilution for TNFα and 25×–100× dilution for the detection of IL-6. The dilutions need to be optimized per stimulus and might differ between laboratories, batches of stimuli, and donors. The appropriate controls for the assay are the following:
<ul>
<li>Non-trained, non-rechallenged cells: No detectable cytokine production</li>
<li>Trained, non-rechallenged cells: No detectable cytokine production</li>
<li>Non-trained, rechallenged cells: High cytokine production</li>
<li>Trained, rechallenged cells: Very high cytokine production</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The magnitude of the induction of trained immunity will correspond to the increase of the production of TNFα or IL-6 between the non-trained, rechallenged cells and trained-rechallenged cells (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>After the induction of trained immunity in monocytes, the cells that have been exposed briefly to the first challenge with β-glucan or BCG will present increased production of IL-6 and TNFα after LPS or Pam3Cys restimulation than cells that were not exposed to a trained immunity-inducing stimulus (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>This protocol allows the use of paired samples. Cells from the same donor will be challenged with different stimuli and the production of cytokines by the cells of the same donor can be compared. Cytokine production generally is non-parametric. In this regard, you can perform a non-parametric, paired analysis to compare the values of cytokine production after restimulation of the cells. Therefore, you can employ the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test the hypothesis that the cytokine production of trained cells after restimulation is different than that of non-trained cells.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This is an <i>in vitro</i> approach for the induction of trained immunity with different stimuli. It is an alternative to <i>in vivo</i> approaches but does not substitute it.</p>
<p>Natural cell death may occur during the experiment depending on the stimulus employed, this is why the evaluation of cell death together with the estimation of cell number in the wells ensures a correct estimation of the trained immunity effect.</p>
<p>This protocol is optimized for its use in human primary monocytes. Its application to other cell types susceptible of undergoing trained immunity, such as natural killer cells, dendritic cells, or mouse cells, would need further adjustments and optimization. The protocol also needs to be amended when used in (human) cell lines such as THP1 monocytes.</p>
<p>In our protocol we employ human pooled serum obtained in-house. Other laboratories successfully employ similar protocols using commercial sera from different sources, such as 10% (heat-inactivated) human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich, H3667) (<a href="#bib3">Leonhardt et al., 2018</a>). The use of a different source of serum (including FCS) might require further adjustment of the concentrations employed to achieve an optimal induction of trained immunity.</p>
<p>We employ β-glucan kindly provided by Prof. David Williams (East Tennessee State University). Other laboratories have successfully employed β-glucan from different sources such as Beta-glucan peptide (Invivogen, Cat#tlrl-bgp) in mice (<a href="#bib2">Kalafati et al., 2020</a>). However, the suitability and trained immunity-inducing capacities of the alternative sources of β-glucan needs to be tested per laboratory and experimental setup.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Inadequate separation of layers during Ficoll/Percoll isolation (related to Before your begin session)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Solution 1</h3>
<p>Make sure that the acceleration and break settings of the centrifuge are set correctly. At high speed, the phases might mix and disturb the gradient. Remember to slowly lay the monocyte suspension on the Percoll/Ficoll solution. Make sure that your concentration of monocytes or the amount of blood per tube does not exceed the recommendations. The Ficoll-Paque PLUS reagent and the Percoll solution should be at room temperature.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Too much clumping of the cells during the separation:</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Solution 2</h3>
<p>You can consider to add 2 mM sterile EDTA to your PBS. This will reduce the clumping. Make sure that the addition of EDTA does not interfere with the subsequent assays.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Lack of induction of trained immunity:</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Solution 3</h3>
<p>The most likely is a contamination of the trained immunity-inducing stimulus with e.g., LPS. If the stimuli employed for the first challenge are contaminated, this can cause the cells to become unresponsive to any secondary stimulation. If you are using BCG to induce trained immunity, make sure it is freshly reconstituted, it can lose its ability to induce trained immunity within a few days after reconstitution. Recent vaccinations or infections can also induce alterations in the induction of trained immunity in monocytes. Please also note that it is known that there is profound interindividual variation in training capacity, which depends, at least in part, on genetic variation in proteins involved in the mechanisms that drive trained immunity.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Variability between batches of stimuli:</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Solution 4</h3>
<p>Diverse batches of stimuli present different abilities to induce trained immunity. This can affect both the challenge employed for the first challenge and the second. Every time we employ a new batch of any given stimulus we should compare cell survival, the ability to induce trained immunity and the cytokine production of the cells compared to the previous batch and adjust accordingly the concentrations.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Variability depending on the time of the year (seasonality of the results):</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Solution 5</h3>
<p>It is known that the behavior of the immune responses varies depending on the time of the year, affecting cytokine responses (<a href="#bib5">Ter Horst et al., 2016</a>). In general, cytokine responses decrease during winter months, which is probably due to the increased incidence transmission of influenza and other diseases, which alter the cytokine production patterns. In this regard, it is recommended to keep a register of the different cytokine responses observed during the year to estimate the impact of seasonality in your experiments.</p>
