<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic iron-dependent cell death. Here we present a protocol for stratifying ferroptosis sensitivity in cells and mouse tissues. This protocol uses photochemical activation of lipid peroxidation (PALP) coupled with fluorescent imaging to assess the relative sensitivity to ferroptosis. Using commercial reagents and common equipment, PALP is readily accessible to most laboratories. One remaining challenge is the inability to multiplex this technique in analyzing multiple tissues or regions simultaneously. This protocol may have applications in developing ferroptosis-targeted therapies.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(22)00069-7/sref7">Wang et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic, iron-dependent form of oxidative cell death characterized by uncontrolled peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing phospholipids. Ferroptosis induction has been implicated as a new therapeutic strategy for treating various cancers (<a href="#bib4">Jiang et al., 2021</a>). However, rapidly stratifying cells or cancer patients for their sensitivity to ferroptosis induction remains a major challenge in developing ferroptosis-targeted anti-cancer treatment (<a href="#bib4">Jiang et al., 2021</a>). Herein, we establish a technique termed <u>p</u>hotochemical <u>a</u>ctivation of membrane <u>l</u>ipid <u>p</u>eroxidation (PALP) to detect polyunsaturated phospholipids as well as report ferroptosis sensitivity in live cells and tissues <i>in situ</i>.</p>
<p>This protocol provides a detailed description of the PALP technique aimed to stratify ferroptosis sensitivity in cells and tissues <i>in situ</i>. Essential materials for this method include: fresh cell and tissue samples, cryostat for tissue sectioning, confocal microscope/spinning-disk confocal microscope/multi-photon microscope or equivalent, BODIPY™ 581/591 C11 (fluorescent reporter for lipid peroxidation), and imaging analysis software. Before implementing this protocol, users need to be familiar with the principle/usage of confocal microscopes and tissue sectioning procedures. While this protocol focuses on using PALP to analyze cancer cells in culture and tissues dissected from mouse models, this technique can, in principle, be applied to any cultured cells and fresh tissue samples.</p>
<p>For tumor tissue in this protocol, we subcutaneously injected one group of female athymic nude mice (5 weeks old, 18–20 g, n=3) with 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> human OVCAR-8 cells on the left flank and with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> ES-2 cells on the right flank. Another group of mice from same lineage(n=3) were subcutaneously injected with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> OV56 cells on the left flank and with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> SKOV3 cells on the right flank. The mice were sacrificed when the tumor volume reached ~ 60 mm<sup>3</sup>. Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the animal protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Westlake University.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparation of fluorescent lipid peroxidation reporter reagent</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min</div>
<p>This protocol uses BODIPY™ 581/591 C11 (Life Technologies, D3861) as the reporter for lipid peroxidation. BODIPY-C11 can be used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lipophilic environments such as cellular membranes. Oxidation of the polyunsaturated butadienyl structure in BODIPY-C11 results in a shift of fluorescence emission peak from ∼590 nm to ∼510 nm (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) (<a href="#bib2">Drummen et al., 2002</a>). We recommend preparing BODIPY-C11 at 5 mM (1000×) stock concentration with the working concentration of 5 μM (1×). In principle, other fluorescent reporters of lipid peroxidation could be used in place of BODIPY-C11.</p>

<p>By following this protocol, users can expect to track lipid peroxidation dynamics, assess polyunsaturated phospholipid levels, and stratify ferroptosis sensitivity of live cells and tissues. PALP stimulation can induce strong oxidative BODIPY-C11 signals in ferroptosis-susceptible samples.</p>
<p>For live-cell imaging, we pretreated ferroptosis-susceptible 786-O clear-cell renal cell carcinoma cells and ES-2 clear-cell ovarian carcinoma cells with iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO), or lipophilic radical-trapping antioxidants ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) (<a href="#bib1">Dixon et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib3">Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib8">Zilka et al., 2017</a>). The final concentration of DFO, Fer-1, and Lip-1 in the assays was 50 μM, 5 μM, and 1 μM, respectively. 4-h treatment with each of the three chemicals prior to PALP stimulation significantly suppressed the signal of PALPv1-induced fluorescence in both ES-2 and 786-O cells (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, <a href="#mmc1">Methods video S1</a>).</p>

<p>To assess ferroptosis sensitivity of tumor tissues <i>in situ</i>, we subcutaneously implanted immunocompromised mice with four ovarian cancer cell lines that exhibit different ferroptosis sensitivities, with the sensitivity rank of ES-2 &gt; OVCAR-8 &gt; OV56 &gt; SKOV3 (<a href="#bib7">Wang et al., 2021</a>). We applied high-power laser to randomly selected, localized regions (n=16 ± 4) in xenograft sections representative of the tumor tissue’s sensitivity to ferroptosis. The PALPv1 signal ranking of ovarian xenograft tumor sections was also ES-2 &gt; OVCAR-8 &gt; OV56 &gt; SKOV3 (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>We use a high-power laser to induce lipid peroxidation in membranes. To focus the energy from the laser for efficient lipid peroxidation induction without causing cell death, PALP stimulation is restricted to a small region that is less than 10 μm<sup>2</sup>. Hence, our protocol for stratifying ferroptosis sensitivity is limited in spatial throughput, and multiple regions need to be sampled to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of the ferroptosis sensitivity on a prepared tissue sample. Secondly, the lipid peroxidation dye BODIPY-C11 has different penetration efficiency in various cell types and tissues. For different cell lines, users are suggested to compare the PALP-induced signal intensity by normalizing the oxidative BODIPY-C11 fluorescent signal post-stimulation to reduced pre-stimulation BODIPY-C11 signal (Ox<sub>post</sub> / Re<sub>pre</sub>). Thirdly, different models of high-power laser sources have different power outputs and varying lipid peroxidation induction efficacy, hence, PALP induced signal from different microscope systems is not necessarily directly comparable. In addition, the PALP technique in its current form is compatible with live cell marker staining, providing information on the specific cell types targeted before PALP analysis. However, the fluorescent signal of cellular markers may be quenched after applying a high power laser.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Both reduced and oxidative BODIPY-C11 signals from different cells vary significantly, the background signal affects PALP-induced fluorescence (steps 11 and 16)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>BODIPY-C11 is a lipophilic dye that associates with membranes. Different types of cells exhibit different lipid content and variable BODIPY-C11 dye penetration efficiency. Hence, there will be variations in the signal from reduced BODIPY-C11 (561 nm) prior to PALP induction. To assess the ferroptosis sensitivity of cells, we recommend using the ratio between oxidized and reduced BODIPY-C11 (Ox<sub>post</sub> / Re<sub>pre</sub>), rather than the oxidized BODIPY-C11 signal (Ox<sub>post</sub>) alone. Consider subtracting the basal level of BODIPY-C11 oxidation (Ox<sub>pre</sub>) when this signal is substantial.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Occasionally, when the laser is targeted to cellular regions with low BODIPY-C11 (Re<sub>pre</sub>) distribution, PALP will not induce oxidized BODIPY-C11 signal in the 488 nm channel (step 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>One limitation of the PALP technique is that it can only assess the polyunsaturated lipid level and relative ferroptosis sensitivity in cellular structures that the BODIPY-C11 dye can effectively penetrate and stain, for example, the endoplasmic reticulum. We recommend using the images of the pre-laser BODIPY-C11 (Re<sub>pre</sub>) distribution to guide the selection of PALP regions to be targeted by the laser. For live cells, cellular structures (e.g., the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria) that exhibit strong BODIPY-C11 pre-staining are suitable candidate regions for PALP analyses.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The reduced BODIPY-C11 signal before PALP application is weak or quenched (steps 11 and 16).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>One possible reason to this problem is that the BODIPY-C11 solution is degraded or inactivated due to light exposure. Users need to keep the staining solutions shielded from light throughout the pre-staining and PALP application process. Another plausible reason is that the solution lost its quality after multiple freeze-thaw cycles. We recommend aliquoting the stock solution to small volumes to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>After applying PALP laser to a region with high Re<sub>pre</sub> signal, the oxidative BODIPY-C11 signal does not increase (steps 14 and 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Please check the settings of the laser associated with the microscope to ensure sufficient power can be triggered and targeted to a focused sample area (&lt;10 μm<sup>2</sup>). If the laser settings are correct, the low signal of oxidative BODIPY-C11 represents that the tissue is potentially resistant to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis induction.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The oxidative BODIPY-C11 fluorescent signal diffuses rapidly after applying laser to the region of interest (steps 14 and 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Lipid peroxidation could be triggered by PALP in highly mobile or dynamic cellular structures such as the endoplasmic reticulum or intracellular vesicles. In these cases, the oxidized BODIPY-C11 molecules may be carried to other cellular spaces rapidly along with the targeted cellular structure. These are intrinsic features of cells undergoing targeted lipid peroxidation and can be potentially investigated accordingly.</p>
