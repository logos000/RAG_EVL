<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a potentially unlimited source to generate endothelial cells (ECs) for numerous applications. Here, we describe a 7-day protocol to differentiate up to 55 million vascular endothelial cells (viECs) from 3.5 million human iPSCs using small molecules to regulate specific transcription factors. We also describe a parallel-plate flow chamber system to study EC behavior under physiological shear stress.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Atchison et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 35 min</div>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are cultured in 6-well plates coated with human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-qualified Matrigel for maintenance culture, and Matrigel-coated T-75 flasks for differentiation. Matrigel is used at 1:100 dilution in DMEM/F-12 media.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Before starting, aliquot Matrigel into 120 μL single-use aliquots as described in the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section.</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>One 120 μL aliquot of Matrigel can coat two 6-well plates or 3 T-75 flasks. To begin coating, thaw the desired number of aliquots of Matrigel on ice for 1 hour.</li>
<li>For each 120 μL Matrigel aliquot, prepare 12 mL cold DMEM/F-12 in a conical tube.</li>
<li>Use a 200 μL pipette to transfer thawed Matrigel to the cold DMEM/F-12.</li>
<li>Mix the solution and add 1 mL per well for 6-well plates or 4 mL per T-75.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Since this is a small volume of coating solution, gently shake the flask or well to ensure that the entire surface is covered. Do not plate cells on Matrigel that has dried up. See <a href="#sec7.1">troubleshooting 1</a>.</div>
<ol start="11">
<li>Incubate the plates for 30 minutes at 37°C in a humidified cell culture incubator.</li>
</ol>
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause Point:</span> If they are not being used on the same day as coating, Matrigel-coated plates can be wrapped in Parafilm and stored at 2–8°C for up to 1 week. Keep the plates on a level surface to prevent uneven coating. When ready to use, remove Parafilm and warm the plate in a humidified incubator at 37°C for 30 min. Do not use the plates if the Matrigel solution on all or part of the culture surface has evaporated.</div>
<ol start="12">
<li>When ready to use the Matrigel-coated plate, aspirate the DMEM/F-12 and add cell solution. Refer to the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section for specific cell densities for each step of the protocol.</li>

</ol>
<h3 id="sec1.5">Coat plates with collagen</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>Differentiated viECs are cultured on plates coated with 0.05 mg/mL collagen I. Plates can be coated with collagen I between 1 hour and 1 week in advance of plating viECs.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Collagen I promotes normal EC phenotype as opposed to fibronectin, which is deposited preceding atherosclerotic lesion development <i>in vivo</i> and promotes EC inflammation (<a href="#bib1">Al-Yafeai et al., 2018</a>). Additionally, we have found in our experiments that viEC adhesion during parallel plate flow experiments is improved when they are plated on collagen I rather than fibronectin.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Corning Collagen I stock solution concentration varies based on lot but is always between 3–4 mg/mL and is dissolved in 0.02 M acetic acid. Before starting, make a solution of sterile 0.02 M acetic acid as described in the <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section to use for further diluting the Collagen I to 0.05 mg/mL per the manufacturer’s instructions.</div>
<ol start="14">
<li>Calculate the volume of collagen I solution needed based on the following volume relations and the number of flasks desired: 5 mL collagen I solution per T-75 flask, 10 mL collagen I solution per T-175 flask, and 2 mL collagen I solution per SlideFlask.</li>
<li>Dilute collagen I to 0.05 mg/ml in 0.02 M acetic acid of the appropriate volume for the number of plates being coated.</li>
<li>Add the diluted collagen I solution to the flasks and incubate at 20°C–25°C for 1 hour on a flat surface such that coating solution is evenly distributed across the culture area.</li>
<li>Aspirate the collagen I solution and wash plates with PBS once.</li>
<li>Aspirate PBS and use the plates immediately or store at 4°C for up to one week.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Do not forget to wash collagen-coated plates with PBS to remove the toxic acetic acid. See <a href="#sec7.3">troubleshooting 2</a>.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.6">Fabricate, assemble, and sterilize parallel plate perfusion circuit components</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 weeks</div>
<ol start="19">
<li>Design and fabricate the parallel plate flow chamber
<ol type="a">
<li>Fabricate a parallel plate flow chamber from acrylic or polycarbonate as detailed in the engineering designs and descriptions provided in the <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section. The exact dimensions can be customized to enable the desired shear stress and flow rate based on the pump being used.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Our flow chamber which is pictured throughout the protocol has a metal bottom with a glass window in the center to enable visualization of the slide, and an acrylic top. Alternatively, for ease we recommend that the entire flow chamber be made of acrylic, polycarbonate, or another cell-compatible material.</div>
</li>
<li>Screw twelve 10–24 threaded 1″ Phillips flat head screws into the threaded holes of the bottom half of the chamber.</li>
<li>Reserve twelve 10–24 wingnuts that fit the screws to be used to assemble the chamber during flow experiment set-up.</li>
<li>Screw in a 5/32″ barbed tube fitting + 10–32 male threaded pipe to each side of the top piece of the chamber to serve as inlet/outlet ports.</li>
<li>A silicone gasket separates the two pieces of the flow chamber and provides a flow path. Cut a gasket of desired thickness such that it fits onto the bottom half of the chamber and frames a culture area around the slide (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A). We use 0.02″ thick gaskets with 3′ × 1′ slides of 0.04″ (1 mm) thickness, which allows imaging with a 10× microscope objective. To view at 20× or 50×, an extra-long working distance objective is needed.

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Thicker slides may be used as long as the depth of groove for the slide in the bottom piece of the flow chamber is modified to fit the thicker slide and the thickness of the bottom piece of the chamber and the slide combined is smaller than the working distance of the microscope objective being used. 1 mm slides are suitable for 10× normal working distance objectives. Slides thicker than 1 mm may require extra-long working distance objectives to visualize the cells. Slides thinner than 1 mm are not recommended as they may break too easily.</div>
<ol start="20">
<li>Measure the height of the flow path
<ol type="a">
<li>Use a slide of known thickness to calibrate the focus knob of a microscope such that the height in mm corresponding to moving one tick mark of the focus knob is known. Mark an “A” on the bottom of a 1 mm thick slide and a “B” on the top of the slide. Use the microscope to focus on the A, then on the B, and count the number of tick marks and focus knob rotations required to move between the two points. Divide 1 mm by the number of tick marks between A and B to get the distance that the focus knob moves in mm per tick mark.</li>
<li>Mark a spot on the top of another slide with an “A” and place it in the flow chamber.</li>
<li>Lay the gasket flush on the bottom of the chamber.</li>
<li>Mark a spot on the bottom surface of the top half of the flow chamber (the side that will come into contact with the slide) with a “B”.</li>
<li>Assemble the chamber and screw all twelve wingnuts tightly.</li>
<li>Fill the chamber with media or PBS from one of the side ports using a syringe.</li>
<li>Use the calibrated microscope to focus on the “A” and note the tick number on the focus knob.</li>
<li>Focus on “B” and note the tick number on the focus knob.</li>
<li>Determine the number of rotations &amp; tick marks between the two focal planes and multiply by the mm per tick mark calibration calculated in step 20a to determine the height above the slide in the flow chamber.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The measured height should be similar to the thickness of the gasket if the slide is flush with the bottom half of the chamber when sitting in its groove. As an example, our gasket is 0.05 mm and our measured flow path height is 0.0495 mm. The small decrease in the measured height of the flow path reflects the nominal gasket thickness and gasket compression.</div>
<ol start="21">
<li>Sterilize the parallel plate flow chamber.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Acrylic can be sterilized by ethylene oxide (EtO) or with bleach followed by UV light exposure for 1 h. It cannot withstand autoclaving. Polycarbonate can be autoclaved, although its dimensions will alter slightly over time with repeated autoclaving.</div>
<ol start="22">
<li>Assemble the pulse dampener
<ol type="a">
<li>Connect two 4-way stopcocks to form the bottom of the pulse dampener (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). These will be used control media flow in and out of the pulse dampener during parallel plate flow experiment set-up.</li>
<li>Do not connect the syringes from the figure now; these will be added later when setting up the flow chamber.</li>
<li>Sterilize the stopcocks using ethylene oxide sterilization (they are not autoclavable).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="23">
<li>Assemble the tubing
<ol type="a">
<li>
<b>Inlet tubing:</b> cut a long stretch of Masterflex L/S Precision Pump PharMed BPT L/S 14 tubing (Cole Parmer EW-06508-14) that can reach from inside a cell culture incubator to above the incubator where the pump sits. The length depends on the incubator dimensions but may be around 36 inches. This tubing will connect the reservoir with the left side of the pulse dampener and must reach out of the cell culture incubator to connect to the pump.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Since the inlet tubing reaches outside the incubator and must withstand the pressure of the closed incubator door without deforming and forming bubbles in the flow circuit, PharMed BPT tubing is used which performs well under high pressure.</div>
</li>
<li>Insert a female luer + 3/32″ barb fitting on one end of the inlet tubing (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). This will connect to one end of the pulse dampener later.</li>
<li>
<b>Outlet tubing:</b> cut two 10 inch stretches of Masterflex L/S Precision Pump Peroxide-Cured Silicone L/S 14 tubing (Cole Parmer EW-96400-14) and two 4 inch stretches of Masterflex L/S Precision Pump Peroxide-Cured Silicone L/S 16 tubing (Cole Parmer EW-96400-16). This tubing will connect the pulse dampener to the flow chamber on one side and connect the other side of the flow chamber back to the reservoir.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Since the outlet tubing is completely contained inside the cell culture incubator and does not have to withstand the pressure of the closed incubator door, Peroxide-Cured Silicone tubing is used which has advantages in biocompatibility and transparency to allow visualization of the media flow.</div>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> The short stretches of L/S 16 tubing are needed to fit the 5/32″ inlet/outlet ports included on the flow chamber. We choose to use short stretches of L/S 16 tubing and connect them with longer stretches of L/S 14 tubing which forms the bulk of the outlet tubing to reduce media usage, as L/S 14 tubing has a smaller inner diameter than L/S 16 and therefore requires less media to fill. If media cost is not an issue, the L/S 14 tubing can be omitted in favor of only two 14-inch stretches of L/S 16 tubing to form the outlet tubing. This will not affect the results of the parallel plate flow chamber experiment, but will double the amount of media needed during experiment set-up.</div>
</li>
<li>Use straight tubing connectors and reducers to connect the tubing in the following order: L/S 14 – L/S 16 – L/S 16 – L/S 14 (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B).</li>
<li>Insert a male luer + 3/32″ barb fitting on one end of the outlet tubing. This will connect to the right side of the pulse dampener later.</li>
<li>
<b>Gas exchange tubing:</b> cut a 3-inch stretch of Masterflex L/S Precision Pump Peroxide-Cured Silicone L/S 14 tubing (Cole Parmer EW-96400-14) and insert a female luer + 3/32″ barb fitting on one end (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). This will be connected to a syringe filter during flow experiment set-up and inserted through the media reservoir cap to allow sterile gas exchange.</li>
<li>
<b>Media reservoir:</b> Obtain a 50 mL media bottle with a screw cap and drill 3 holes in the cap large enough to fit the L/S 14 size tubing (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The L/S 14 and L/S 16 size tubing of the lengths we report require 30 mL of media to fill the tubing and leave enough media left in the reservoir to flow through the circuit. For other sizes of tubing, the media volume and reservoir size should be optimized.</div>
</li>
<li>
<b>Assembly:</b> Screw the media reservoir closed and insert the empty ends of the inlet tubing, outlet tubing, and gas exchange tubing into the holes in the cap (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). This is the complete flow circuit tubing into which the pulse dampener and flow chamber will be inserted during flow experiment set-up.</li>
<li>Use autoclave tape on the cap to secure the tubing.</li>
<li>Sterilize the tubing and reservoir by autoclaving or EtO sterilization.</li>

From each side port, a 0.74″ long and 0.16″ diameter hole extends into the chamber component to connect with a rectangular 0.98″ wide by 0.20″ high by 0.06″ thick hole that extends from the bottom of the piece upwards, forming a path for media to flow in through the side port, through the cylindrical hole, and down to the bottom of the chamber. This chamber part also has twelve 0.23″ diameter holes that loosely fit 10–24 screws.

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The 12 holes in the top half of the chamber are larger than the diameter of the screws and are not threaded such that the whole top piece can be easily dropped onto all 12 screws simultaneously during assembly without having to tighten each screw individually.</div>
<ul>
<li>The bottom half of the chamber includes a groove to fit a 3 × 1″ (75 × 25mm), 0.04″ (1 mm) thick slide and 12 threaded holes to tightly fit 10–24 thread 1″ flat head Phillips screws (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>C and 2D).</li>

The flow chamber can be made of any cell compatible material. Ideally, the chamber should be transparent to allow visualization of the slide. Our chamber bottom is made of metal with a glass window in the slide area, and the top is made of acrylic. For ease of fabrication and use, the chamber can be made entirely of acrylic or of polycarbonate instead. We use a 0.02″ (∼0.05 cm) thick gasket and the exact height of our flow path is 0.019″ (0.0495 cm). Gaskets purchased from Specialty Manufacturing Inc range from 0.002″ to 0.06″ in thickness but typical gasket thickness for parallel plate flow chambers ranges from 0.007″ to 0.02″ to keep flow rates reasonable. The width to height ratio of the flow path should be equal to or greater than 20:1 to ensure that the shear stress is uniform on the cell surface.</p>

<li>Remove a vial of iPSCs from liquid nitrogen and place in a water bath set to 37°C. Swirl the vial in the water to heat evenly until only a small ice chunk remains (∼1 minute).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We freeze our iPSCs at a density of 1 million cells in 1 mL of Cryo-SFM freezing medium and thaw this amount into 2 wells of a 6-well plate.</div>

<li>In a biosafety cabinet, use a 1000 μl pipette to transfer thawed cells to a 15 mL conical tube.</li>
<li>Using a serological pipette, slowly add 9 mL warm mTeSR Plus to the cells.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the cells at 170 × <i>g</i> for 5 minutes.</li>

Without ROCK inhibitor treatment on the first day after thawing, the survival of the plated iPSCs will significantly decrease.</div>
</li>
<li>Plate the cells in 2 wells of the Matrigel-coated 6-well plate by aspirating the Matrigel solution in those 2 wells and adding 2 mL cell solution per well.</li>

<li>For continued culture after recovery from thawing, repeat step 4 to passage cells at a 1:6 ratio in 6-well plates every 3 days. Note that to split 1 well of cells at a 1:6 ratio, 6 new wells should be filled with media in step 4a and 160 μL dissociated cell solution will be added to each of the new wells in step 4g.</li>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Poor survival immediately after thawing is expected, but iPSCs still must be passaged every 3–4 days to prevent spontaneous differentiation. If 60%–80% confluence is not reached after 3 days, passage iPSCs at a lower ratio (even 1:1) until they recover from cryopreservation. After one or two passages, they should reach 60%–80% confluence after 3 days and can be passaged 1:6 routinely. See <a href="#sec7.5">troubleshooting 3</a> and <a href="#sec7.7">4</a>.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Endothelial cells (ECs) line the inner walls of blood vessels and regulate vascular tone, structure, and inflammation. ECs are crucial to maintaining vascular homeostasis and their dysfunction plays a critical role in driving prevalent vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis and hypertension (<a href="#bib18">Williams and Wu, 2019</a>). Primary human ECs are difficult to obtain and have limited plasticity and proliferative capacity, making them unsuitable for <i>in vitro</i> applications requiring large numbers of cells. In contrast, iPSCs offer a potentially unlimited source to generate ECs for a variety of applications including disease modeling, cell therapies, tissue graft vascularization, and microphysiological systems. Here we have described a simple, rapid protocol to differentiate vascular endothelial cells (viECs) from human iPSCs under serum-free conditions using small molecules to regulate specific transcription factors. Since endothelial cell behavior is highly dependent on exposure to physiological shear stress, we also describe the design and use of a parallel plate flow chamber system to assay for viEC alignment, gene expression, and protein expression after exposure to flow. Once the appropriate materials and procedures are established, the success rate of differentiation and parallel plate flow experiments is very high.</p>
<p>Undifferentiated iPSCs form colonies of tightly packed cells with prominent nucleoli (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A). <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B shows typical morphology observed on days 1–7 of differentiation and <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C shows typical viEC morphology 3 days after sorting. On day 1, cells form a network of single cells due to the presence of ROCK inhibitor. On day 2 after ROCK inhibitor is removed, cells should aggregate into colonies. On days 3–4, cells proliferate and form mesoderm and the media may turn yellow due to low pH. On day 5 after 24 hours of culture in endothelial induction media, cell morphology will begin to change as the cells differentiate. On days 6 and 7, two cell layers should form, with non-endothelial cells forming the top layer and endothelial cells forming the bottom layer. Differentiating ECs can be seen through holes in the top cell layer which typically forms a patchy network as shown in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B. Some cell death on days 3–7 is normal due to the high cell density in the flask, though excessive cell death may indicate that the iPSC seeding density on day 0 was too high. MACS sorting for CD31+ and CD144+ cells recovers ∼50% of the cells on average based on cell count before and after sorting, with yields up to 55 million cells from one T-75 immediately after sorting. After sorting, differentiated viECs will proliferate in ∼2–4 days to form a confluent monolayer. SB431542 treatment significantly improves viEC proliferation; without treatment viECs will become senescent after 2–3 passages (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>F and 5G). Sorted viECs show 99 ± 0.6% positive PECAM (CD31) expression and 99 ± 0.3% VE-Cadherin (CD144) expression (mean ± SEM, <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A). They also form tube networks when plated in Matrigel in 96-well plates for 24 hours (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B; <a href="#bib2">Atchison et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<p>After completing parallel plate flow experiments, we routinely fix, stain, or isolate RNA from the cells. Typical RNA yield varies between 20–100 ng/μL. After exposure to physiological shear stress, endothelial cells align in the direction of flow and upregulate numerous flow-sensitive genes. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (<i>NOS3)</i> is upregulated in response to flow and generates nitric oxide in endothelial cells, a vasodilator with critical roles in maintaining vascular homeostasis (<a href="#bib11">Oliveira-Paula et al., 2016</a>). Nitric oxide production after exposure to shear stress is an important marker of healthy endothelial function as limited nitric oxide bioavailability is an early marker of atherosclerosis and a hallmark of EC dysfunction (<a href="#bib5">Gimbrone, Jr and García-Cardeña, 2016</a>). <i>KLF2</i> (Kruppel-like factor 2) is a major anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic flow-responsive transcription factor which regulates ∼46% of EC flow-sensitive genes and is upregulated by EC exposure to laminar flow (<a href="#bib9">Nakajima and Mochizuki, 2017</a>). <i>KLF2</i> promotes the activation of antioxidant transcription factor <i>NRF2</i> and both of these genes promote EC quiescence (<a href="#bib9">Nakajima and Mochizuki, 2017</a>). <i>NRF2</i> regulates the expression of several targets including <i>NQO1, TXNRD1, GCLM, GCLC,</i> and <i>HO-1</i> (<a href="#bib14">Tonelli et al., 2018</a>). We compared the expression of these 8 genes in viECs under static and flow conditions and compared these results with those from human cord blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells (hCB-EPCs) as a primary endothelium control (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). Compared with hCB-EPCs under static conditions, hCB-EPCs exposed to 1.2 Pa for 24 hours upregulate all of the flow-responsive genes that we tested. viECs exposed to the same conditions upregulate all of the genes except <i>NOS3</i>, which shows no significant difference between static viECs and viECs under flow. Compared with the hCB-EPCs exposed to shear stress, the fold increase in expression of <i>KLF2</i> and <i>NRF2</i> is higher in viECs exposed the same conditions. However, the while the genes are upregulated, the fold increases in expression of <i>NRF2</i> targets <i>NQO1</i>, <i>TXNRD1</i>, <i>GCLM</i>, <i>GCLC</i>, and <i>HO-1</i> in viECs exposed to shear stress are all lower than in hCB-EPCs exposed to the same conditions (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). Importantly, despite the lack of <i>NOS3</i> upregulation detected by RT-PCR (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C), DAF-FM DA assay results show that viECs do upregulate nitric oxide production after exposure to flow for 24 hours (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D). Finally, after exposure to shear stress, viECs show alignment in the direction of flow as indicated by a significant decrease in cell orientation angle relative to the flow direction (p=0.0371, one-sided t-test, <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>E). An angle of 0° indicates complete alignment and an angle of 45° indicates no alignment. viECs exposed to shear stress also show a significant decrease in roundness (p=0.0335, one-sided t-test, <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>E) determined by the following formula: <math> <mrow> <mi>R</mi> <mi>o</mi> <mi>u</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>d</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>s</mi> <mi>s</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mfrac> <mrow> <mn>4</mn> <mi>A</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>π</mi> <msup> <mi>L</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math> where A is the cell area and L is the chord length (<a href="#bib2">Atchison et al., 2020</a>). A roundness of 1 indicates a perfect circle and a roundness of 0 indicates a straight line.</p>
<p>Our differentiation protocol was adapted from <a href="#bib13">Patsch et al. (2015)</a> which provides advantages in speed, yield, and efficiency compared with other protocols. We made adjustments to the Pastch et al. protocol to improve viEC attachment under shear stress conditions. Specifically, we altered the duration of endothelial induction, plate coating conditions, cell sorting process, and added a phase of culture in conditioned media. Contrary to previous protocols, this protocol uses chemically defined conditions and does not require co-culture with stromal cells or embryoid body formation (<a href="#bib10">Nourse et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib8">Li et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, in contrast to other chemically defined protocols whose differentiation efficiency was limited to 10%–30%, we retrieve 50% of the cells on average when we sort for CD31+ and CD144+ cells on the final day of differentiation (<a href="#bib12">Orlova et al., 2014</a>). The differentiation process is rapid, generating up to 55 million viECs from 3.5 million iPSCs within 7 days which can then be expanded for several passages. One recently published protocol reported rapid generation of iPSC-derived ECs with &gt;90% efficiency using small molecule treatment in 2D monolayer culture (<a href="#bib16">Tsujimoto et al., 2020</a>). However, these cells were only tested for CD31 expression, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (<i>NOS3</i>) expression, and tube formation in Matrigel. No other functional assays were reported and the behavior of these cells under shear stress is not known. The protocol we report is easily scalable, results are consistent across multiple cell lines, and it can be used to model endothelial behavior in human genetic diseases. In <a href="#bib2">Atchison et al., (2020)</a>, we report the use of this protocol to produce endothelial cells from iPSCs derived from Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) patients. HGPS viECs express similar levels of EC markers as healthy viECs, but exhibit lower tube formation ability in Matrigel, blunted upregulation of flow-sensitive genes, and downregulation of <i>NOS3</i> after exposure to shear stress indicating reduced nitric oxide bioavailability (<a href="#bib2">Atchison et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Endothelial cells respond to shear stress through mechanosensitive pathways which affect phenotype and function, including antioxidant and inflammatory pathways. Moreover, different flow patterns and temporal waveforms are associated with either atheroprone or atheroprotective endothelial behavior, demonstrating the value of studying endothelial behavior under physiological shear stress and not only under static conditions. In our own experiments, we have observed shear-stress dependent changes in antioxidant and inflammatory gene expression and have demonstrated differences in nitric oxide production under shear stress between healthy and diseased endothelial cells that affect vasodilation in tissue engineered blood vessels made from these cells (<a href="#bib2">Atchison et al., 2020</a>). Parallel plate flow experiments offer the opportunity to study iPSC-derived endothelial cell behavior under physiological shear stresses <i>in vitro.</i> The protocol we report provides consistent results with a high rate of success. The transparency and dimensions of the flow chamber allow visualization of the cells before and after flow, and enough cells can be retrieved for downstream analysis of gene and protein expression. The system has the potential to be scaled up if desired, and the shear stress can be adjusted easily by varying the flow rate. The custom pulse dampener we present decreases media volume significantly compared with commercial pulse dampeners used in other protocols (<a href="#bib7">Lane et al., 2012</a>). Further, by removing the pulse dampener or using micropumps with adjustable flow patterns, the system provides the potential to compare continuous and pulsatile flow or study endothelial response to atheroprone vs atheroprotective flow patterns.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>Depending on the experimental design, we analyze the data using one- or two-way ANOVAs with post-hoc Tukey tests. Levene’s test is used to test equality of variance before running the ANOVAs. If the Levene’s test shows unequal variances, then nonparametric tests are used. Data is only excluded if an error is identified in the protocol (e.g., inappropriate cell seeding causes cells to detach during differentiation or bubbles in the flow chamber causes loss of cells). Immunohistochemistry images are quantified based on positive cell count per area using FIJI.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>We have reproduced this differentiation protocol numerous times using 9 different iPSC lines, including 4 healthy cell lines and 5 cell lines from donors with Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome. The rate of successful differentiation is very high, with rare exceptions when the seeding density is not optimized for the cell line being used or the input iPSCs are not of high quality (i.e., spontaneously differentiated). The viECs produced by this protocol exhibit several characteristic functions of endothelial cells including EC marker expression, alignment in the direction of flow, upregulation of flow-sensitive genes, and production of nitric oxide when exposed to flow (<a href="#bib2">Atchison et al., 2020</a>). Their main limitations are in proliferation and morphology. viECs exhibit confluent monolayers only up to passage 2, after which they come senescent. They are larger and have more rounded morphology than primary ECs, typical of a senescent EC phenotype. Treatment with 10 μM SB431542 after sorting significantly improves viEC proliferation, allowing them to be passaged at least 5 times without becoming senescent. However, all parallel plate flow experiment results reported in <a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>B–5E are for viECs between passages 1–3 that have not been treated with SB431542. In flow experiments with p1 viECs from one cell line, gene expression results were similar between non-treated viECs and viECs treated with 10 μM SB431542. Further experimentation is required to compare viEC behavior under flow after treatment with SB431542 in other cell lines and at higher passages.</p>
<p>Once optimized, the parallel plate flow protocol is consistently successful. If problems arise, they are usually due to lack of careful set-up causing bubbles in the flow circuit or leaking out of the chamber or one of the tubing connections. One limitation is that some viECs are still lost during the flow experiment, even when the shear stress ramp-up protocol is used. Enough viECs do remain adhered to the slide for downstream immunohistochemistry or RNA extraction, but multiple slides may need to be aggregated for applications requiring large cell numbers. For applications that require more cells, it may be possible to scale up the system using custom slides and larger size chambers. In this case, a new flow rate must be calculated based on the shear stress calculation provided in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> (step 61) using the new chamber dimensions. The new chamber width:height ratio should be at least 20:1 to make sure the flow is 1-dimensional and the shear stress is uniform (<a href="#bib15">Truskey, Yuan and Katz, 2009</a>). For applications that require imaging the cells while they are still mounted in the chamber, the thickness of the custom slides and the chamber bottom combined must be smaller than the working distance of the desired microscope objective.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>iPSCs are growing on part of the well but not on the entire surface.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is likely due to poor Matrigel coating in the part of the well without cells. Be sure to shake the plate when coating it such that the Matrigel solution covers the entire well, and never use a plate if it the Matrigel solution in part of or the whole well has evaporated. If coating a T-75 and not planning on using it the same day, use 5–6 mL coating solution per flask rather than 4 mL to reduce the likelihood of the solution evaporating before the flask is used.</p>

<p>Make sure to wash the plate well with PBS after collagen coating to remove the acetic acid which is toxic to cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>iPSCs are sparse after thawing and do not look confluent enough to passage after 3–4 days.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is expected; iPSCs have poor survival after thawing. Supplementation with 10 μM Y-27632 for the first 18–24 hours is essential to improve iPSC survival after thawing. Even if the iPSCs do not look confluent, passage them every 3–4 days anyway at low ratios (1:1 or 1:2) until they recover and proliferate normally. Do not start a differentiation until the iPSCs have been passaged enough that they proliferate normally and reach 60%–80% confluence within 3 days.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>iPSCs do not have normal morphology and look differentiated.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Healthy iPSCs are small and rounded, have a high nucleus:cytoplasm ratio with prominent nucleoli, and pack into tight colonies (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A). Spontaneously differentiated cells are larger, more angular, and do not have prominent nucleoli (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D). These cells should be extremely rare or non-existent in the culture. If there are numerous spontaneously differentiated cells such as in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D, this may be due to leaving the iPSCs for too long without passaging (&gt; 3–4 days). Start over with another vial of iPSCs and passage them on a regular 3-day schedule, varying the split ratio rather than the timetable based on confluence. Alternatively, pure iPSC colonies can be picked out of a mixed population of iPSCs and spontaneously differentiated cells using a 200 μL pipette and transferred to a new Matrigel-coated well. However, not all transplanted colonies will survive so this technique is labor intensive with a low success rate.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Cell death is high during the mesoderm and endothelial induction phases of differentiation. Is this normal?</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Some cell death is normal during days 3–7 of the differentiation process due to the high cell density in the flask and continued proliferation of the cells. This is not concerning and should not be mistaken for contamination if the media is cloudy with dead cells (unless bacteria is seen under the microscope, in which case the culture is contaminated and should be thrown out). If cell death is very high and percent positive CD31 and CD144 cells recovered after MACS sorting is lower than 50%, then the iPSC seeding density may be too high and should be optimized.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>The viECs do not proliferate to form a confluent monolayer after p2. How can their proliferation be improved?</p>
<h3 id="sec7.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Supplementation with 10 μM SB431542 (TGF-β inhibitor) significantly improves viEC proliferation.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>When I increase the flow rate, the plungers of the pulse dampener syringes rise.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use parafilm to tightly secure the plungers in place. This is essential to prevent them from rising. If they rise out of the barrel of the syringe while the experiment is running in the incubator, the media leakage will be catastrophic.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.15">Problem 8</h3>
<p>I set up the pulse dampener, but the media flowing through the tubing still looks pulsatile.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.16">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure that both stopcocks are set to open flow to both syringes of the pulse dampener (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>F). If the flow to the syringes is blocked, the pulse dampener is closed and will not affect the flow pattern.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.17">Problem 9</h3>
<p>The chamber is filled with bubbles.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.18">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are several potential sources of bubbles and methods to avoid them. First, be sure to fill the entire tubing circuit with media and remove any bubbles before connecting the flow chamber to the circuit. Second, when the pump is turned on, the syringes of the pulse dampener will fill with more media and when the pump is turned off, they will drain slightly. If the media level in the pulse dampener is too low, the syringes will drain completely when the pump is turned off and this will introduce bubbles in the circuit. Ensure that both syringes are filled with at least 5 mL media when setting up the experiment. Third, secure the media reservoir and the pulse dampener tightly to the tray using tape such that they are not tipped over while the experiment is running, which will also introduce bubbles. Fourth, when assembling the flow chamber, drop the top of the chamber swiftly onto the bottom rather than lowering it slowly. We have found that dropping it creates more of a mess but introduces fewer bubbles in the chamber. Fifth and finally, use the PharMed BPT (polypropylene) tubing (Cole Parmer EW-06508-14) rather than silicone tubing for the inlet portion of the flow circuit that reaches outside the incubator and connects to the pump. The PharMed BPT tubing is less compliant than the silicone tubing and can withstand the pressure of the incubator door closing without generating bubbles, whereas silicone tubing will deform under the pressure and introduce bubbles in the flow circuit.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.19">Problem 10</h3>
<p>Media leaks from the chamber, pulse dampener, or tubing connections when the pump is turned on.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.20">Potential solution</h3>
<p>All connections must be secured very tightly to prevent leaking and leaking should be rectified immediately. If a large leak persists it can drain all the media from the system, and if a small leak persists it can cause contamination. If the chamber is leaking, this may be due to the gasket not being flush with the bottom of the chamber, in which case the creases of the gasket will not allow the chamber to be tightly closed and will cause leaking. Alternatively, the wingnuts may need to be secured tighter using pliers (finger strength may not be enough to secure them tightly). If the pulse dampener or tubing connection points are leaking, they should be screwed tightly together and wrapped snugly in parafilm. We routinely wrap all tubing connections in parafilm as a preventative measure, even when leaking is not observed. If the tubing itself is leaking at a location where there is no connection, it is likely damaged and should be replaced.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.21">Problem 11</h3>
<p>The cells detached from the slide during the flow experiment.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.22">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Exposure to high shear stress after static culture can cause the cells to detach from the slide, which is why we implement a shear stress ramp-up protocol to condition them slowly to shear stress. If the cells are still detaching, try optimizing the ramp-up protocol for your specific cell line. Additionally, we have found that cell attachment during the flow experiments is improved for our cells when they are cultured in 10% serum. If using serum-free conditions, consider adding serum to the culture medium if possible.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.23">Problem 12</h3>
<p>The cells do not align in the direction of flow or respond to flow properly after 24 hours.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.24">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check calculations and flow rate to ensure that shear stress on the cells is at least 1.0 Pa. If sufficient shear stress is being used, increase the time under flow to 48 hours.</p>
