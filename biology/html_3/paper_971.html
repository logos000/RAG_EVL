<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Intrinsic optical signal imaging (ISI) is a hemodynamic response-based technique to map the functional architecture of the cortex. ISI is often used as an auxiliary method to localize cortical areas for targeted electrophysiology, pharmacology, or imaging experiments. Here, we provide a protocol for ISI through a cranial window with an access port to identify the area of the primary visual cortex (V1) in a head-fixed mouse, followed by targeted viral vector injection, which enables subsequent two-photon imaging of V1 layer 6 corticothalamic neurons.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to our paper <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00485-8/sref3">Augustinaite and Kuhn (2020b)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Intrinsic optical signal imaging (ISI) in the mammalian brain (<a href="#bib8">Grinvald et al., 1986</a>) is a procedure to generate functional maps of cerebral cortex. The mechanism of ISI is based on wavelength-dependent changes of light absorption and reflection due to activity-dependent changes of blood flow, volume, and oxygenation in the observed brain regions (<a href="#bib4">Frostig et al., 1990</a>, <a href="#bib15">Pouratian and Toga, 2002</a>).</p>
<p>The imaging of this signal in mice can be performed using different acute or chronic head-fixed animal preparations, such as intact or thinned bone (<a href="#bib10">Juavinett et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib21">Schuett et al., 2002</a>, <a href="#bib13">Marshel et al., 2011</a>, <a href="#bib19">Roth et al., 2012</a>, <a href="#bib5">Garrett et al., 2014</a>), or chronic cranial window (<a href="#bib3">Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020b</a>, <a href="#bib11">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</a>). Here, we describe materials and methods for ISI through the cranial window of an anesthetized head-fixed mouse to map the area of primary visual cortex (V1). The procedure can be easily adapted for other sensory areas.</p>
<p>The map of a cortical area can be used for targeted viral vector injections through the window access port of the chronic cranial window (<a href="#bib16">Roome and Kuhn, 2014</a>). Such post-surgery injections enable controlled localization and timing of the viral expression. For example, we used this method to co-label retrogradely marked V1 layer 6 corticothalamic neurons with a genetically encoded calcium indicator and subsequently for two-photon imaging of neuronal calcium activity (<a href="#bib3">Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020b</a>).</p>
<p>In this protocol, we provide instructions for population-labeling of cortical layer 6 neurons in an Ntsr1-Cre mouse line. The technique can also be used for other cortical layers or brain regions, single cell labeling with synthetic dye, or other electrophysiological as well as pharmacological manipulations prior-, during- or even after the imaging experiment (<a href="#bib16">Roome and Kuhn, 2014</a>, <a href="#bib17">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</a>, <a href="#bib12">Kuhn and Roome, 2019</a>).</p>

The green filter in combination with the LED light will be used to acquire high-contrast images of the brain surface vasculature (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>E, <a href="#fig2">2</a>A, and <a href="#fig3">3</a>A).
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Green LED light (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A; 540–600 nm, X-Cite XLED1, Excelitas Technologies) can be used. In this case, no filter is necessary.</div>

</li>
<li>A large stimulation monitor (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B; LCD, 47.5 ×26.5 cm, 60 Hz refresh rate, DELL), positioned at a 45° angle to the mouse axis at distance from the eye that results in maximal coverage of the visual field (15 cm), contralateral to the hemisphere with a cranial window.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> A smaller, and, therefore, closer positioned screen can also be used for stimulus presentation if properly calibrated and synchronized with imaging data acquisition (see steps 2c and 2d).</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> The setup can be easily modified for ISI of the other sensory areas. For example, an air outlet (tube connector OD, 4 mm; ID, 2 mm, WPI) can be positioned at a 20°–30° angle at about 0.5 cm distance from the mouse (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C) to stimulate whiskers / whisker pad with an air-puff (Picospritzer III, Parker) for mapping the barrel field of primary somatosensory cortex.</div>
</li>
<li>Generate a 5 s visual stimulus sequence (imaging trial in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>F) using software package for visual psychophysics (Psykinematix, KyberVision): 1 s of baseline (full screen RGB black, luminance 0.16 cd m<sup>−2</sup>) followed by 1 s visual stimulation (4 direction full-field drifting gratings (135°, 180°, 225° and 270°, 250 ms duration each; temporal frequency 2 Hz; spatial frequency (0.04–0.1 cycles per degree; one frequency per experiment) and contrast (RGB black/blue or gray 50%–100%; one contrast per experiment)), and 3 s post-stimulus time (full screen RGB black, luminance 0.16 cd m<sup>−2</sup>).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> As shown by intrinsic autofluorescence and calcium imaging, special combinations of spatial and temporal frequencies preferentially activate higher order visual areas (HVAs). For example, anterolateral area (AL) neurons prefer high temporal, but low spatial frequency visual stimuli; posteromedial area (PM) neurons, in contrast, prefer low temporal, but high spatial frequency stimuli; while neurons in lateromedial (LM), anteromedial (AM) and laterointermediate (LI) areas prefer higher temporal as well as higher spatial frequencies (<a href="#bib1">Andermann et al., 2011</a>, <a href="#bib13">Marshel et al., 2011</a>, <a href="#bib7">Glickfeld and Olsen, 2017</a>, <a href="#bib6">Glickfeld et al., 2013</a>). However, we did not observe differences in the resulting image of V1, nor clear images of distinct HVAs when using different frequency, full-field drifting gratings. Most likely, different stimulation and data analysis algorithms than presented in this protocol should be chosen for HVA segmentation from ISI data (for details see <a href="#bib5">Garrett et al., 2014</a>, <a href="#bib10">Juavinett et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib11">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</a>, <a href="#bib13">Marshel et al., 2011</a>, reviewed in <a href="#bib7">Glickfeld and Olsen, 2017</a>).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Full-field stimulation will activate full retina and V1, accordingly. Use spatially restricted stimulation for retinotopic imaging (<a href="#bib21">Schuett et al., 2002</a>, <a href="#bib10">Juavinett et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib5">Garrett et al., 2014</a>, <a href="#bib11">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</a>, <a href="#bib13">Marshel et al., 2011</a>).</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> The user can choose any psychophysics toolbox, software package or programmable graphics hardware for generation of the visual stimulus sequence if it can be synchronized with the data acquisition (step 2d and <a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>F and 1G). For alternative configurations see other references (for example: <a href="#bib10">Juavinett et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib11">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</a>, <a href="#bib21">Schuett et al., 2002</a>).</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> An appropriate stimulation should be chosen for intrinsic imaging of other sensory areas. For example, the intrinsic signal of the barrel field of the primary somatosensory area can be activated by a brief (0.25 s) air-puff (40 psi) delivered to the whiskers / whisker pad (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C, 1G, and <a href="#fig4">4</a>C).</div>
</li>
<li>Synchronize sensory stimulation with imaging data acquisition.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Stimulation and imaging must be synchronized (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>E–1G). Typically, stimulation and camera-controlling software are different programs on different computers. At least one of the two units must be able to generate a start trigger pulse and the other unit must be triggerable. Alternatively, synchronization can be achieved by using additional instruments (for example, a pulse generator (Master 9, A.M.P.I.)).</div>
</li>
<li>Check that anesthetic vaporizer contains enough isoflurane for at least 1h.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Preparation for injection through the access port of the chronic cranial window is independent of preparation for ISI.</div>
<ol type="a">
<li>To the basic setup arrangement (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A) add motorized micromanipulator (MP-285, Sutter Instrument) mounted on a stand (MT-75, Sutter Instrument).
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Select a 4-axis micromanipulator, allowing movements in x, y, z and diagonal directions. The diagonal movement will be used for the pipette insertion into the brain (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).</div>
</li>
<li>Mount the pipette holder (H-2, Narishige) on the micromanipulator.</li>
<li>Prepare a thick wall microinjection pipette (quartz glass OD, 1 mm; ID, 0.3 mm; Sutter Instrument) pulled using a pipette puller (P-2000, Sutter Instrument). Bevel the pipette tip at a 35° angle with a sharp tip and a 10–15 μm opening (short axis of the elliptic opening; BV-10, Sutter Instrument) (<a href="#bib2">Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020a</a>). The pipette will be connected to the manometer (PM015D, W.P.I.) with appropriate silicone tubing (ID ≤ 1mm for tight sealing; Axel) and mounted on the pipette holder during injection.
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Borosilicate glass can be used instead of quartz glass. Borosilicate glass can be easier pulled (does not require a puller with CO<sub>2</sub> laser heating) but the tip is more flexible. Therefore, penetration of the silicone and dura as well as hitting deep targets is more challenging (see step 28).</div>

<li>Transfer vial with a viral vector (here, AAV9.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6f, typically 10 μL) from −80°C to +4°C.</li>

So, to reach a relative noise level (coefficient of variation) of less than 0.1%, more than 1,000,000 photons must be detected (<math> <mrow> <mfrac> <msqrt> <mn>1,000,000</mn> </msqrt> <mn>1,000,000</mn> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.001</mn> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.1</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </math>).

This horizontal distance must be calculated with the tangent formula from the access angle and the target depth.

A 1-mm access port gives some flexibility to reach the target, but not much (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B). Alternatively, the shape of the access port can be changed, or diameter can be increased.

For labeling layer 6 in the mouse primary visual cortex (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>I; (<a href="#bib3">Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020b</a>)), we used (a) 950 μm cortical depth, (b) 170 μm thick glass for the cranial window and (c) 380 μm distance above the glass (380 μm was chosen for convenience, to get d = 1500 μm).

</li>
<li>Switch again to the diagonal movement mode and approach the surface of the access port (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>A and <a href="#fig6">6</a>D).

Change the mounting / diagonal movement angle or reconsider the target if necessary. Keep in mind that steeper angles fit more for the closer (or deeper) injection sites, while more shallow angles can be selected for more distant (or shallow) injection sites (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>B and 5C).

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Intrinsic signal imaging and injections through the access port of the cranial window can be performed on the same imaging setup by adding sensory stimulation equipment, a stable, red-light source, a suitable camera, a body temperature control system, and a micromanipulator system with injection apparatus. It can be also combined with a two-photon setup (for example, two-photon imaging setup, <a href="#bib3">Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020b</a>, <a href="#bib17">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</a>, <a href="#bib12">Kuhn and Roome, 2019</a>).</p>
<p>Once the animal has recovered from the cranial window surgery and the window is clear (<a href="#bib2">Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020a</a>), the full area of V1 can be mapped reliably with ISI (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>E–3H). The imaging can be repeated at any time, if necessary. Also, the somatosensory cortex can be mapped in addition to V1, providing an alternative method to outline the higher-order visual cortical areas (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>E–3H and <a href="#fig4">4</a>).</p>
<p>If the chronic cranial window has an access port, the generated maps can be used for two photon imaging combined with targeted electrophysiological, pharmacological, or labeling procedures (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Like ISI, the access to the brain depends on the condition of the window: If the window is clear, the injections can be made soon (few days) or late (few weeks or months) after the surgery (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>I). The procedure might be especially useful for behavioral two-photon imaging experiments, when expression of the fluorescent agent must be delayed because of long-lasting training of the animals.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The quality of the chronic cranial window and physiological state of the mouse will define the quality of the ISI and injections through the access port as well as the quality of the subsequent two photon imaging. Additionally, the size and position of the window will limit the field of view, while size, shape and position of the access port will restrain the approachability of the target sites. Therefore we recommend obtaining stereotaxic coordinates from a mouse brain atlas (<a href="#bib14">Paxinos and Franklin, 2013</a>) for window- and access port location, as well as collecting experience from own surgeries and experiments (<a href="#bib2">Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020a</a>, <a href="#bib3">Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020b</a>, <a href="#bib16">Roome and Kuhn, 2014</a>, <a href="#bib17">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</a>, <a href="#bib12">Kuhn and Roome, 2019</a>).</p>
<p>The sensory stimulation elicited intrinsic response is very small (0.1%; <a href="#bib8">Grinvald et al., 1986</a>). Such small signal can be registered only in anesthetized animal, when the baseline activity is also very low. Otherwise, the sensory response drowns in the background activity, that is, hemodynamic activity of the blood vessels, stronger heartbeat and breathing artefacts as well as neuronal activity caused by motor- and cognitive processing in the awake and behaving animal.</p>
<p>Only the brain surface, but no deeper structures can be studied with ISI. Usually, this method is limited to cortical architecture mapping and not used for actual functional imaging because of the low spatial (about 100 μm) and temporal (rise time of &gt; 1s) resolution (<a href="#bib8">Grinvald et al., 1986</a>). Also, due to light scattering, the ISI signal can be not attributed to a specific cortical layer.</p>
<p>In theory, any target can be reached for injections or other kind of manipulations through the access port. However, due to the lack of anatomical coordinates (after the cranial window surgery) and technological limitations related to the deep imaging, the procedure is largely restricted to the upper brain structures, such as cortex or cerebellum.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Type of anesthesia (steps: 2, 6, 17)</p>
<p>The signal strength and trial-by-trial reproducibility depends on the selected anesthetics. Two aspects must be considered when performing ISI of the visual cortex: (i) stable (and not too high) level of the anesthesia and (ii) immobilization of the eye/ preventing pupil dilation. Usually, this cannot be achieved by a single-drug anesthesia.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Stable anesthesia level providing Isoflurane is known to diminish cortical neuronal activity (reviewed in <a href="#bib22">Sorrenti et al., 2021</a>, <a href="#bib23">Voss et al., 2019</a>), therefore should be used at low concentrations. In combination with a sedative agent (here, Midazolam and Medetomidine; or, for example, Chlorprothixene (<a href="#bib10">Juavinett et al., 2017</a>)) allows to keep Isoflurane concentration as low as 0.25%.</p>
<p>Additionally, use alpha2 adrenoreceptor agonists (here, Medetomidine) to relax the muscles of the eye and pupil. This will prevent the movements of the eye and spontaneous pupil dilations.</p>
<p>Other combinations of drugs can be used. In our experience, Isoflurane complementary mix of Ketamine (100 μg / g) and Xylazine (20 μg / g) ip has very similar effect as Midazolam and Medetomidine.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Depth of anesthesia (steps: 2, 5, 6, 12, 17)</p>
<p>The depth of anesthesia strongly affects ISI signal because anesthesia modulates the strength of the hemodynamic response: neuronal activity in response to sensory stimulation, baseline neuronal activity, and transduction of neuronal activity via glial and vascular cells to blood flow and oxygen supply of the brain. Mapping of cortical areas will fail if the response to sensory stimulation is too weak or cannot overcome baseline background activity.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Choose an imaging plane 400–600 μm below the brain surface to minimize artefacts mediated by the large blood vessels from the brain surface.</p>
<p>Maintain 35°C–37°C body temperature and 0.25%–1% isoflurane anesthesia throughout the whole imaging procedure while keeping in mind that lower body temperature and deeper anesthesia will weaken all hemodynamic signals.</p>
<p>Observe the animal: trembling whiskers and pupillary light response indicates wakening and therefore too light anesthesia.</p>
<p>Inspect recordings after 5–6 trials. Absence of response indicates too high anesthesia, while blood vessel patterns or highly variable signals indicate too low levels of anesthesia. Change the concentration of isoflurane accordingly and record more trials.</p>
<p>Do not record longer than 1h. Better repeat the imaging on the next day. A longer recovery period from the surgery might be required.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Low signal-to-noise ratio (steps: 3, 14, 15, 18)</p>
<p>ISI will fail if the imaging noise is not minimized. Noise can be introduced by movement artefacts of the mouse, instable or dim illumination, or wrong camera settings.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Firmly fix the head to minimize movement artefacts during the recording. The window glass should slightly press on the brain to reduce movement artefacts due to breathing or heartbeat (see, <a href="#bib2">Augustinaite &amp; Kuhn 2020a</a> for details of the chronic cranial window surgery).</p>
<p>Position the brain surface perpendicular to the axis of the objective lens to collect the maximal amount of reflected light from the brain.</p>
<p>Test the light source by imaging a (non-living) dummy sample. Adjust camera settings (maximal frame rate and exposure time) and power of the LED light source to use the full dynamic range of the digitization to achieve highest signal-to-noise ratio per trial. Allow red LED light source to warm up and stabilize for constant illumination. Also, record more trials because signal-to-noise ratio can be increased by spatial and temporal averaging within and between trials during offline data analysis.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Failure of the pipette insertion into the brain (steps: 25, 26, 28)</p>
<p>The pipette might hit the glass, slide, bend, and even break, but fail to penetrate the silicon of the access port or dura when moving diagonally downwards.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use thick wall quartz glass pipettes with relatively short shafts (&lt; 4 mm), beveled at less than 45° angle (<a href="#bib2">Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020a</a>) and mount it with the beveled side of the tip facing to the side or upwards. Select the steepest penetration angle possible. The pipette should be rigid enough to penetrate the silicone and dura without bending.</p>
<p>Always check the injection trajectory. Make sure there are no obstacles in the pipettes path and the penetration point will be far enough from the edges of the access port.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Brain damage (steps: 25, 26, 28)</p>
<p>The pipette will cause a lot of damage by tearing the brain tissue during insertion if mounted and then moved diagonally at a different angle. Also, the pipette might cut through blood vessels during penetration, causing bleeding under the cranial window.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Measure the mounting angle of the pipette and the micromanipulator settings for the diagonal movement mode. The angles must be the same.</p>
<p>Check the penetration trajectory. Even if the pathway looked clear, be aware of the possibility to hit the blood vessel during dura penetration. Go back and change the penetration angle or reconsider the target site if a big blood vessel appears to be on the way, especially, during penetration of the dura.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Failure of the target area labeling (steps: 26–29)</p>
<p>The pipette might not reach the anticipated target site if it bends or breaks when pushed against the edge of the access port. Even if incision was successful, the injected solution might spread upwards along the pipette track, instead of diffusing into the tissue at the target site.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check the pathway. Arrange penetration point to be far enough from the edges of the access port. Closely observe the pipette during motion: wrong movement direction (for example, up- or forward instead of diagonal down) or absence of the movement indicates that pipette is hitting the glass. Try to change diagonal movement angle or target site. If the problem persists systematically, try to make pipettes with narrower shafts or change the shape of the access port (for example, a slit instead of a circle).</p>
<p>Always apply weak positive pressure before loading the pipette with a solution and keep it till the injection, as well as during waiting period before the pipette retraction. It prevents air (when outside) or cerebrospinal fluid (when in the brain) to tip-fill the pipette and dilute the viral vector solution. The pressure should be adjusted depending on the viscosity of the solution as well as inner diameter of the injection pipette. Otherwise, if too high positive pressure is applied, the solution will be ejected, emptying the pipette before entering the brain, or causing strong labeling along the pipette tract in the tissue.</p>
<p>Wait for 3–5 min before and after the injection allowing the tissue to seal around the pipette and injected solution to diffuse into the tissue at the injection site, instead of spreading up along the pipette, or filling the pipette track after too fast pipette retraction.</p>
<p>If possible, always observe the meniscus of the solution during injection. Like waiting periods, slow injection (50 nL/3–5 min) allows solution to spread locally at the injection site instead of going up along the outer walls of the pipette.</p>
