<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The patch-clamp recording technique is indispensable for studying ion channel functions of cells but is challenging to apply to the node of Ranvier, a key site where action potentials are conducted along myelinated nerves. We have developed a pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording method applying to the node of Ranvier of rat myelinated nerves. The step-by-step protocol described here allows researchers to apply this approach to study mechanisms underlying saltatory conduction and information processing in myelinated nerves of mammals.</p>
<p>For complete information on the generation and use of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib1">Kanda et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Main components of the pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording system</div>
<p>Diagram illustrates the main components of the pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording system. It consists of (I) an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with infra-red differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) and fluorescent imaging systems; (II) a patch-clamp recording system with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and a recording head stage (a); (III) a high-speed pressure-clamp (HSPC) device containing an HSPC controller unit and an HSPC head stage; and (IV) a custom-made recording chamber. The HSPC head stage is connected via silicon tubing to the holder of the patch-clamp recording pipette so that the pressure within the recording pipette can be adjusted to a desired level. In addition, a glass syringe is also connected via silicon tubing to the recording pipette holder, which is mainly used to manually apply positive pressures into the recording pipette to push air bubbles out of the recording pipette as a beginning step of each experiment. In this setup a suction stimulation electrode (b) is also included for experiments to evoke nerve impulses from a distal end of the nerve bundle.</p>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Pay attention and make sure that there is no air leakage in the pressure- clamped patch-clamp recording system and that the positive pressure is well maintained in the recording pipette.

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It may take several attempts with forward-backward-forward movement of the recording pipette tip to penetrate the perineurium at the node of Ranvier. After the pipette tip successfully penetrates the perineurium, one can see that there is an immediate expansion in the space between myelin and perineurium. This change may be due to the flowing of the recording electrode internal solution into the space.</div>

</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Since axonal membrane is unable to be clearly differentiated from perineural tissues and Schwann cell membranes under the IR-DIC microscope, accessing axonal membranes with the recording pipette tip is mainly judged by the reduction of seal-test currents. Once touching axonal membranes, one can see a strong current oscillation accompanied with the reduction of seal-test currents in seal-test traces (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>E). On the other hand, if the recording pipette tip touches Schwann cell membranes, current oscillation is usually very weak or absent, although seal-test currents become reduced as well (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>E). After the penetration of perineurium, the tip of the recording pipette should be very close to the nodal axon (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>E). To contact the nodal axon membranes, one only needs to slightly adjust the position of the recording pipette tip up and down in less than 1 μm until seeing the aforementioned changes of seal-test currents.</div>

<li>Gently push (1–2 μm) against the nodal axon with the tip of the recording electrode to allow the resistance of the seal test to increase to approximately 15 MΩ. This allows the recording pipette tip to optimally contact nodal membranes.</li>
<li>Gradually reduce the positive pressures in the recording pipette to negative pressures of −2 to −10 mmHg in approximately 10 s.</li>
<li>Wait for 30 s to 3 min until the formation of gigaohm seals (usually &gt;5 GΩ) between the recording pipette and the axonal membranes at the node of Ranvier.</li>
<li>Compensate the pipette capacitance before rupturing nodal axon membranes to form the whole-cell recording configuration.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> At this point, one may perform single-channel recordings from the nodal axon membranes using the cell-attached recording configuration.</div>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Axonal membranes at the node of Ranvier usually can be ruptured by the short electrical pulses in less than 100 pulses leading to the whole-cell patch-clamp recording configuration.

<ol start="23">
<li>After establishing the whole-cell patch-clamp recording configuration, quickly adjust the negative pressure from −30 mmHg to −5 mmHg.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>We have described above in detail the experimental steps of applying pressure- clamped patch-clamp recording technique to the axon at a single node of Ranvier in rat myelinated fiber. After establishing the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration on the axonal membrane at the node of Ranvier, one can also trace and characterize the morphological properties of the myelinated axon including diameters and lengths of nodes of Ranvier and inter-nodal distances if recording electrode internal solution also contains the fluorescent dye Alexa 555 at the concentration of 85 μM (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A).</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 5. An example of a successful pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording at the node of Ranvier of a myelinated nerve fiber</div>
<p>The recording is made from a myelinated nerve fiber in a rat infraorbital nerve bundle and the recording electrode internal solution also contains the fluorescent dye Alexa-555.</p>
<p>(A) Fluorescent image shows a long axon labeled by Alexa-555 following a successful pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording in the whole-cell configuration. The tip of the patch-clamp recording pipette points to a node of Ranvier where the recording is made. Arrows indicate other nodes of Ranvier along the nerve fibers. The asterisk in the middle of the image indicates the tissue anchor used to affix the nerve bundle in the recording chamber. Scale bar, 100 μm.</p>
<p>(B) Traces show currents recorded at a node of Ranvier in response to voltage steps from −102 mV to 58 mV in an increment of 10 mV each step.</p>
<p>(C) Traces show action potentials recorded at a node of Ranvier following the injections of depolarizing currents from the patch-clamp recording electrode. Red and gray traces in C are membrane responses to the injections of step currents at the rheobase and 2× rheobase levels, respectively.</p>

<p>A high-quality recording from nodal axon membranes should show very negative resting potential at approximately −82 mV at the node of Ranvier. Input resistance is approximately 40 MΩ when recorded at the node of Ranvier of Aβ fibers of ION and approximately 35 MΩ when recorded at the node of Ranvier of Aα motor nerve fibers.</p>
<p>Under the voltage-clamp configuration, we have detected transient inward currents mediated by the voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and large non-inactivating outward currents mediated by TREK-1 and TRAAK channels in responses to depolarizing voltage steps (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B) (<a href="#bib1">Kanda et al., 2019</a>). Under the current-clamp configuration, we can elicit action potential firing at the node of Ranvier following the injection of depolarizing currents (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C) or following the electrical stimulation of the peripheral sites of the nerve bundle by a suction stimulation electrode (<a href="#bib1">Kanda et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p>Some functional characteristics of nodal axon membrane at the node of Ranvier of ION have been described in our recent paper published in Neuron using this new recording technique (<a href="#bib1">Kanda et al., 2019</a>). The STAR protocol described here allows one to apply this new approach to investigate ion channels and their functions at nodes of Ranvier of different nerves. The pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording technique may also be used in conjunction with genetic and molecular biology approaches to advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying action potential conduction and information processing in different types of nervous systems.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Our pressure-clamped patch-clamp recording method is applicable for the nodes of Ranvier of Aα motor nerve fibers and Aβ sensory nerve fibers in rats. Other types of myelinated fibers, including Aδ fibers in sensory nerves and myelinated fibers in the central nervous system, may be too thin in their nodal axon diameters to be easily approached by the recording pipette. At present time, it is not certain if this new recording method is also applicable to the thinner nerve fibers.</p>
<p>Recording pipettes with small tip sizes have to be used in order to access to and make patch-clamp recordings from the axonal membranes at the node of Ranvier. The resistance of these recording pipettes usually is in the range of 8 to 10 MΩ. The higher resistance of the recording pipettes will result in a larger voltage-clamp error. Therefore, one should take the consideration of the voltage-clamp error when interpreting voltage-clamp recording data obtained using our pressure-clamped patch- clamp recording technique.</p>
<p>This protocol has only been applied to rat myelinated nerves. While it might be applicable to the myelinated nerves of other species including mice, this possibility remains to be tested.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Nerve fibers are not healthy as manifested by a large gap at the node of Ranvier (step 10).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that nerve fibers are not over-stretched during making nerve preparations. In most cases, nerve fibers are damaged in the step 4 of removing connective tissues that surround nerve bundles. It is not necessary to completely remove all connective tissues that surround nerve bundles so that the potential nerve damage can be minimized.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Difficult to penetrate through perineurium that surround the axon at the node of Ranvier (step 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check the enzyme to make sure that the stock solution is stored at −20°C for less than 1 month. Increase the enzyme treatment time.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Recording pipettes seal onto Schwann cell membranes rather than onto nodal axon membranes (step 17).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that the tip of the recording pipette penetrates the perineurium right at the node of Ranvier. If the tip of the recording pipette is slightly off from the center of the node of Ranvier, the recording pipette tip will most likely seal onto Schwann cell membranes. It is also important to search nodal axon membranes very carefully by moving the pipette tip within the distance range of 1 μm from the original tip entering point. There is usually large current oscillation in seal test when the recording pipette tip touches axonal membranes. On the other hand, current oscillation in the seal test is not obvious when the recording pipette tip touches Schwann cell membranes.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Cannot form a gigaohm seal on the nodal axon membrane with the recording pipette (step 20).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Because the tip of the recording pipette needs to penetrate perineurium, it is essential to have positive pressures within the recording pipette before the tip of the pipette makes a close contact with nodal axon membranes to form a gigaohm seal. Air leakage in the pressure-clamp patch-clamp recording system is a common problem to prevent the recording electrode from forming a gigaohm seal onto axon membranes at the node of Ranvier. Make sure that there is no air leakage from the tubing, connectors, the recording pipette holder, and the HSPC system.</p>
<p>We also recommend to filter the recording electrode internal solution with a 0.22-μm syringe filter to remove the dust particles in the solution so that the tip of the recording pipette will not be clogged by the dust particles. Clogged recording pipette tip will not be able to form a gigaohm seal on nodal axon membranes and should be discarded.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Electrode access resistances become gradually increased over time during recordings (step 24).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>One cause of the increase in the electrode access resistance is due to partial membrane reseal at the tip of the recording pipette. One will need to reopen the membrane seal in the manner described in step 22. Another common cause of the increase in the electrode access resistance is due to the drift of the tip of the recording pipette. To solve this problem, one needs to check the setups for holding (pipette holder, etc.) and controlling (micromanipulator, etc.) the recording pipette to improve the stability of the setups. If the pipette drift is mild, one can move the recording pipette tip back to the original position, which often can bring the access resistance back to the original level.</p>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Optimizing enzyme treatment is needed for different types of nerves and also for the same type of nerves from animals at different ages. When nerves are optimally treated with the enzymes, it is relatively easy to have recording pipette penetrate through the perineurium and reach to the axonal membranes at the nodal of Ranvier. Insufficient treatment of nerve bundles with the enzymes makes it difficult to penetrate the perineurium. Over-treatment by the enzymes makes the targeted nerve fiber slip away from the tip of the positively pressured recording pipette. One should experiment with the time of the enzyme treatment or concentrations of the enzymes for different nerves to obtain optimal conditions.</div>
