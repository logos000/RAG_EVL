<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Generation of fine-needle aspiration (FNA)-derived cancer organoids has allowed us to develop a number of downstream applications. In this protocol, we start with organoids cultured in a semi-solid format. We dissociate organoids into single cells and then plate in a 384-well format for high-throughput drug screening. While this method must be fine-tuned for each individual organoid culture, it offers a format well suited for rapidly screening medium-sized drug/compound libraries (500–5,000 molecules) and generating dose-response curves to measure relative efficacy.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib1">Lee et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="#bib2">Vilgelm et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>While it would be optimal to plate intact organoids, issues with size inconsistency and fragility currently make this unrealistic to do in high-throughput. With dissociation into single cells, patient-derived cancer organoids can be easily plated and allowed to reform in each well of a 384-well plate.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.2">Plating organoids in a 384-well format</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>Once dissociated, these cells can be plated with established cell suspension plating methods. We utilize two formats of plating, depending on the number of plates needed for the given experiment. The first, which involves plating by hand, is for a small number of plates (≤ 3) or for those who do not have access to high-throughput plating equipment. The other is automated and can be used for large-scale, high-throughput experiments.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Count cells and prepare media

<li>Count cells and resuspend to a concentration of 9,500 cells/mL in complete DMEM + 2% Matrigel in a 50 mL conical tube.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We have successfully used 5% Matrigel as well but find that 2% is sufficient for our cultures and purpose. Using higher percentages of Matrigel, in combination with the optional centrifugation step following plating, may allow for enhanced downstream imaging.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Although this is a low concentration of Matrigel, the cell suspension will still solidify at ambient temperature within minutes, if not kept on ice. The Matrigel should not be added until right before plating, and the cell suspension should be kept on ice prior to and while plating the cell suspension. <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting 2</a>.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We have found that 285 cells per well is an ideal starting concentration for the majority of our organoids. However, for particularly slow-growing cultures, we have increased the number up to 1,000 cells per well. We have not had to decrease the number of initial cells below 285/well for any of our cultures to date. <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting 3</a>.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Plate cells

<li>Equip BioTek EL406 peristaltic pump with a 10 μL wide-bore tip cassette and set to low speed
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Dead volume is the excess volume required by a liquid handling instrument. It can be an unusable portion (e.g., residual volume in labware that is not accessible to the instrument) or a used portion that is not transferred to the assay container, such as the volume needed to prime tubing/tips. To decrease dead volume, reduce pre-dispense volume as much as possible. To decrease cross-well dispensing, minimize the height of the tips to the carrier to as low as 1 mm. Dispense from tips should appear as a drop rather than a stream.</div>
</li>
<li>Swirl the tube of cells prior to priming the tubing and before each plate to ensure equal suspension dispensing. Be careful not to introduce air bubbles.</li>
<li>Dispense 30 μL cell suspension per well into the cell-repellent microplates.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For smaller-scale experiments, cells can be plated using a manual or electronic (repeating) multi-channel P200 pipette. Transfer the cell suspension + Matrigel to an appropriately sized reservoir for the volume size. If possible, place the reservoir on ice to prevent solidification. Avoid introducing bubbles into the media when pipetting.</div>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Following cell plating, centrifuge the plate(s) at 220 × <i>g</i> for 1 min to allow cells to be pushed toward the bottom of the well. This helps to bring the cells and clusters (along with the Matrigel) into similar z-planes, which helps to stabilize the cultures for both downstream applications of microscopy and/or refreshing media or adding reagents to the wells.</div>

<p>Once the organoids are plated, they can be used for a number of different screens. We have used this format for primary screening of a large drug library and collection of dose-effect data for multiple drugs in a single experiment. Likewise, this could be modified for functional genomics screens (e.g., CRISPR, siRNA, etc.), phenotypic screening (e.g., high-content imaging), or other cellular read outs or functional assays.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>While this protocol has worked very well for the thyroid and melanoma organoid lines we have used, it may not work for every organoid line. Very large organoids are difficult to dissociate, due to low penetration of the TrypLE in 30 min. While the TrypLE can be left on longer, it may also cause cell death after prolonged exposure. This can also be an issue for organoids which are not facile; the TrypLE incubation may be too damaging for the cells to reform organoids and grow once plated. While we have not had any survival issues with our lines, a small sample of the culture should be tested with this protocol prior to plating an experiment to ensure that the cells can recover from dissociation.</p>
<p>As discussed in the protocol, the cell numbers listed herein are not concrete for every line. Some slow-growing lines need more cells initially to grow within the allotted experiment time. If you plan on doing a large screen with a line, we would recommend plating one trial plate to observe the growth over the treatment period (3–5 days) with multiple initial cell numbers so that the experiment can be optimized for the individual line you are screening.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Organoids are clumping/will not dissociate.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If starting with large organoids, frequent agitation may be needed to break down the cell clumps.</p>
<p>If the organoids are all clumping together, they can be placed on a shaker or rotator in the incubator to keep them in motion and discourage clumping.</p>
<p>If a significant amount of Matrigel or media is left before the TrypLE is added, this may also hinder dissociation. Make sure to aspirate as much as possible without disturbing the pellet and perform an extra PBS wash if needed.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Cell suspension is too viscous/Matrigel is solidifying.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Do not add the Matrigel until immediately before plating, and make sure to keep the media/cell suspension on ice once the Matrigel is added if possible. Once the Matrigel completely solidifies, it cannot be reversed in a manner that makes it reusable.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Organoids are small/not many form.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the organoids are small or infrequent, more cells may need to be plated in each well initially. If the cell number has already been scaled up and the organoids are still small or not forming, it may be reflective of cell death due to dissociation or the plating method used. Try reducing the dissociation time and switching to a gentler plating method, such as using a multi-channel pipette. It is also important to note that organoid growth patterns are relatively consistent from 24- to 384-well plates. If an organoid line forms small organoids in the 24-well semi-solid format, it will also form small organoids in high-throughput settings.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Organoids remain after adding CellTiter-Glo 3D and mixing.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Adjust the settings on the Bravo or make sure that the pipette tips are going to the bottom of the well, and that it is being mixed as fast as possible. This step can be repeated, but take care not to introduce bubbles.</p>
