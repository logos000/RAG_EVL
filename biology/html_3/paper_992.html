<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We recently demonstrated that the zygotic gene <i>Zscan5b</i> is involved in maintaining the genomic integrity of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) during mitosis and that <i>Zscan5b</i> gene expression can prevent chromosomal abnormalities. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for the transfection of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse-induced PSCs (miPSCs) with a <i>Zscan5b</i> constitutive expression plasmid, using the piggyBac transposon gene expression vector system.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00517-7/sref4">Ogawa et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>To prepare mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) medium (FM10 medium), you can use the 500 mL bottles in which Dulbecco Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) comes in.</li>
<li>Prepare 500 mL DMEM (high glucose) with 56.8 mL fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5.6 mL GlutaMAX, 5.6 mL penicillin-streptomycin (P/S), and 990 μL 2-Mercaptoethanol (2ME).</li>
<li>Filter the FM10 medium using a 0.22 μm polyethersulfone filter for sterilization.</li>
<li>For mESC/miPSC medium (t2i/L medium), prepare 125 mL DMEM/F12 medium.</li>
<li>Add 125 mL Neurobasal, 1.3 mL N2 (100<b>×</b>), 2.6 mL B27 (50<b>×</b>), 2.6 mL non-essential amino acids solution (NEAA), 2.6 mL GlutaMAX, 266 μL 2ME, 2.6 mL P/S, 266 μL human recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (hrLIF; final concentration 1,000 U/mL), CHIR99021 (final concentration 3 μM), and PD0325901 (final concentration 0.2 μM).</li>
<li>Filter the t2i/L medium using a 0.22 μm polyethersulfone filter (Iwaki) for sterilization.</li>

<h2 id="step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</h2>
<p>This protocol is aimed at isolating mouse pluripotent stem cells (mESCs and miPSCs) transfected with a target gene constitutive expression plasmid. Following mESCs/miPSC isolation, the cells are transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged plasmid constitutively expressing <i>Zscan5b</i>. Subsequently, GFP-positive cells are picked using a glass pipette. As an alternative approach, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) can be used to enrich for GFP<sup>+</sup> cells. Once an optimal stable cell clone showing high GFP signals was identified, these cells were expanded.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 24 h</div>
<p><b>Purpose:</b> To perform initial colony picking of GFP-positive ESCs/iPSCs and maintain master stocks.</p>
<p><b>Feeder cells:</b> Inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells (Reprocell RCHEFC003).</p>
<p><b>Tools:</b> Glass tools (World Precision Instruments Inc., TW150-4) or syringe needles can be used for microdissection of colonies for passaging. It is also possible to pick mESC/miPSC colonies using a pipette tip or cell lifter. However, for fine control of dissection when initially isolating good areas of ESC/iPSC colonies from undesirable regions of the colony, glass tools are optimal. For glass tools, Pasteur pipettes are pulled hair thin. Fine glass needles with hooked ends are forged in two steps over a micro burner, as follows:</p>
<ol start="65">
<li>While holding the two ends of a long Pasteur pipette, place the thin end of the pipette at a distance of about half to two-thirds of the distance away from the tip into the orange part of the flame until the glass melts into a solid constriction (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A).

<p>Grasp both ends of the glass capillary and scald it with fire (A). Pull it to both ends after leaving it for 1–2 s (B). When the capillary is stretched, heat it and cut the center (C). The tip of the needle to curl into a hook shape caused by the force of the rising heat (D). Cut it with a ruby pen by making a slit at the end (E). The final product after cut with a ruby pen (F).</p>

</li>
<li>In a single motion, upon removing the pipette from the flame, pull on each end of the pipette gently and quickly to draw out a thin filament before the glass hardens (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B). This is done without breaking the connection between the two ends of the pipette.</li>
<li>Beginning several inches above the flame and slowly moving the thin drawn part of the filament down towards the flame, pull a very fine filament, as previously described. The two ends of the pipette should separate, this time forming a fine needle end on the tip of the pipette (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>C and 4D).</li>
<li>If the tip remained straight after the second pull, pass the fine end a few inches quickly over the top of the flame. The force of the rising heat will curl the tip of the needle into the hook. The hooked end should be thin enough for the microdissection of the colonies but thick enough to withstand some pressure during the dissection (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>E and 4F).</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The transfection efficiency of electroporation was around 20%. By performing colony picking and FACS, it was possible to obtain GFP-positive lines for almost all colonies (<a href="#bib4">Ogawa et al., 2019</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The aim of this protocol is to create a model cell line to investigate genome stability. These results are presented in the paper (<a href="#bib4">Ogawa et al., 2019</a>). Although the PiggyBac vector system is technically simpler than virus-based gene transfer, the efficiency of introducing designed foreign DNA into mESCs/miPSCs via the PiggyBac vector is lower than virus-based gene transfer. Although the PiggyBac vector system is more efficient for gene delivery than genome editing, it cannot control the copy number or location of foreign DNA incorporated into the genomic DNA of target cells.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>CHIR99021 is not fully dissolved in culture medium.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>DMSO can be used for dissolving CHIR99021 for stock solution (3 mM).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Low viability of pluripotent stem cells after thawing (step 24).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Low survival rate: Ensure that cryovials are thawed quickly. Before completely dissolving (with a small ice block), add the pre-warmed 1 mL FM10 media into the mESCs/miPSCs and pipet the thawed cells gently. Viability upon thawing also depends primarily on accurate freezing. If the cells do not survive thawing, try rechecking the freezing procedure and the condition of the frozen tubes.</p>
<p>In case of accidental aspiration of thawed cells after centrifugation: Aspirate the medium immediately after centrifugation to avoid disturbing the cell pellet. You can leave about 200 μL of medium when aspirating. Pipette the pellet with the remaining medium and add 1 mL of FM10 media.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Pluripotent stem cells spontaneous differentiation (step 34).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure that cells are cultured according to the recommendations listed here.</p>
<p>Reagents (medium): Maintain a sufficient amount of fresh culture medium on the cells. Reagents should be freshly prepared. The medium can be stored before the addition of CHIR99021 and PD0325901 at 4°C, and use within two weeks.</p>
<p>Plates: Do not leave the plate outside the incubator to avoid the effects of temperature changes and light on the cells.</p>
<p>Cell number: Reduce the number of cell aggregates per cm<sup>2</sup> at cell passages to reduce colony density.</p>
<p>Colony picking: It is possible to remove differentiated cells by leaving the mESC/miPSC colonies in place and scraping off the differentiated areas with a pipette tip. Care should be taken not to disturb the mESC/miPSC colonies. If good mESC/iPSC colonies remain between the differentiated areas, the colonies with good mESC/iPSC morphology may be picked up manually using a pipette tip. Alternatively, you can use a glass capillary. Set the pore size of the pipette to less than 100 μm (50–70 μm). Make sure that the cutting tips are sharp and free of jagged edges.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Non-uniform distribution of colonies within plate (step 52).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Gelatin coating: Make sure that the entire surface of the tissue culture vessel is properly coated with gelatin.</p>
<p>Plating: Gently move the wells after transfer cell-containing medium approximately twice in forward-backward and left-right while maintaining a horizontal position to allow the mESCs/miPSCs to be evenly distributed. Be careful not to shake the plate when placing it in the incubator, and leave it for 24 h.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Colonies are too crowded together and difficult to pick (step 74).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Reduce the number of cells to be seeded.</p>
