<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We developed a preclinical model of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in conscious diabetic rabbits to identify an early pharmacological intervention for patients with diabetes and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Here, we describe a reproducible protocol for induction of diabetes with subsequent manifestation of myocardial I/R injury in conscious rabbits to mimic the real-life scenario observed in clinical settings. Further, we demonstrate the efficacy of rapamycin at the onset of reperfusion to limit the adverse effect of AMI.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00478-0/sref8">Samidurai et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the result of occlusion of coronary artery, which obstructs the blood flow to the myocardium, a clinical scenario widely known as ischemia. Although, timely and adequately re-establishing blood supply after myocardial ischemia, known as reperfusion of the coronary artery, is mandatory to salvage or prevent the demise of ischemic myocardium, reperfusion itself causes additional ischemic damage by excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction, intracellular calcium overload and proteolysis as well as other metabolic changes (<a href="#bib5">Heusch, 2013</a>; <a href="#bib15">Yellon and Hausenloy, 2007</a>). Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the major risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases, including AMI, which is associated with poor prognosis and eventually higher mortality (<a href="#bib4">Grundy et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#bib6">Hinkel et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p>A chronic activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes and leads to worsening diabetic-associated cardiac complications, including the myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (<a href="#bib2">Das et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib12">Stamateris et al., 2016</a>). We previously demonstrated that mTOR is persistently activated in the hearts of diabetic mice (<a href="#bib1">Das et al., 2014</a>) and chronic pre-treatment with the mTOR inhibitor, Rapamycin (RAPA), improved cardiac function and reduced myocardial infarct size following I/R injury (<a href="#bib1">Das et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib9">Samidurai et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib10">Samidurai et al., 2017</a>). We also showed that treatment with Rapamycin at the onset of reperfusion reduced myocardial infarct size following ischemia in diabetic mice (<a href="#bib2">Das et al., 2015</a>) and diabetic rabbits (<a href="#bib8">Samidurai et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Here, we describe extensive protocols to provide stepwise procedure for the induction of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in rabbit and method for induction acute myocardial I/R injury in the conscious diabetic rabbit. To mimic the clinical scenario of myocardial I/R injury, the conscious rabbit myocardial I/R model was used to avoid the confounding effect of anesthesia during myocardial ischemia. The implantation of balloon to conduct I/R injury under sedation could also minimize the postsurgical complications of acute opening and closing of the chest for performing coronary artery occlusions. We also provide technical details for assessment of myocardial infarct size, apoptosis and cardiac function. In addition, we provide an outline for the administration of Rapamycin at the onset of reperfusion and demonstrate its effect in attenuating I/R injury. The conscious diabetic rabbit myocardial I/R protocol can serve as a powerful preclinical platform for identification and testing the efficacy of novel infarct-sparing therapies.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Acclimation of rabbit</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 week</div>
<p>All experimental protocols were conducted in male New Zealand white rabbits approximately 3–4 months of age and weighing about 2.8–3.0 kg (Robinson Services Incorporated (RSI, NC, USA). After arrival to our facility, the animals were allowed to acclimate to the new housing environment for at least a week before the start of experiment. Standard food and water were freely accessible for the rabbits. The care and use of the animals were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines on Humane Use and Care of Laboratory Animals for <u>biomedical research</u> (National Institutes of Health), which was approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>
<p>All personnel performing surgical procedures should wear proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) while in the surgical suit.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Induction of type I diabetes mellitus in rabbit</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4 weeks</div>
<p>A careful adherence to the following procedure results in the classical symptoms of reliable type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) in rabbit with consistent elevated blood sugar levels of 220 mg/dL for up to 8 weeks (<a href="#bib8">Samidurai et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Body weight and blood glucose level were monitored before the induction of diabetes.</li>
<li>Rabbits were fasted 12 h before the procedure and supplemented with drinking water.</li>
<li>The rabbits were lightly sedated by intramuscular (i.m. in Biceps femoris muscle) administration of Ketamine (35 mg/kg), Xylazine (5 mg/kg) and Atropine (5 mg/kg) (as a cocktail).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is advisable to start the procedure early in the morning around 8–9 AM, so that the animal health can be monitored throughout the day.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Alloxan monohydrate (10 mL; 50 mg/mL) was freshly prepared by dissolving in sterile saline right before its administration and kept on ice all the time.</li>
<li>This solution was aspired in 10 cc syringe and loaded on microprocessor multiple syringe infusion/withdrawal pump unit (Harvard apparatus, Model series ‘22’ Infuse/withdraw, Male Luer Lock, Cat # MA1 55–2226) (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C). The syringe was connected to standard 6-inch bore extension tube with pinch Clamp. Rabbit was infused with appropriate volume of alloxan monohydrate, according to the body weight of the animal, to achieve final concentration 125 mg/kg.

<li>The ear was cleaned with sterile alcohol pads and the ear vein was cannulated with a 24G X ¾ inch Safelet IV catheter and connected to standard bore extension set with pinch clamp, Male Luer Lock. The catheter was safely secured by taping to the earlobe using surgical tape (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A and 3B).</li>
<li>The infusion flow rate of alloxan monohydrate was adjusted through the pump to deliver it slowly for a duration of 10 min. Volume was adjusted with body weight of the rabbit. Example: For a rabbit weighing 3.2 kg, 8 mL of alloxan (125 mg/kg X 3.2 kg, i.e., total 400 mg of aloxan; stock concentration; 50 mg/mL) will be administered, average flow rate 0.8 mL/min through the pump (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C).</li>
<li>The animal was transferred to recovery cage and blood glucose level was monitored using Contour glucose meter (Bayer, NJ, USA) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h post-alloxan injection to prevent hypoglycemic shock.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We use 26G X 3/8 needle to pierce the small vein in the earlobe for blood sugar measurement using a glucose monitor meter.</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>When the blood sugar level drops below 70 mg/dL, animals were supplemented with 5% dextrose (10 mL, i.m.).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In our experiments we observed the blood sugar level starts decreasing to 70 mg/dL around 3.5–4 h after alloxan administration.</div>
<ol start="10">
<li>After 4 h of alloxan treatment, the animals were transported back to the vivarium with normal food and 20% glucose in drinking water for next 3 days.</li>
<li>The health of the animals and blood sugar were checked further after 10–12 h of alloxan administration, if again blood sugar level drops below 70 mg/dL, 5% dextrose was administered (i.m.) at 10–12 h of post alloxan infusion.</li>
<li>The animals were maintained for 4 weeks and during this time blood sugar was measured twice (morning/evening) every day. When blood glucose level exceeded 450 mg/dL, rabbits were injected (i.m.) insulin (Novolin-R, Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Inc. Princeton, NJ). For example, rabbits with blood glucose level (BGL) 400–500 mg/dL received 1–2 U/kg of insulin; BGL 500–600 mg/dl received 3 U/kg, and BGL &gt; 600 mg/dl received 4 U/kg.</li>

<li>All rabbits were given Buprenorphine SR LAB (0.1 mg/kg, i.m.) prior to surgery.</li>
<li>Gentamicin was also administered before surgery and on the first and second postoperative days (0.7 mg/kg; i.m.; each day).</li>
<li>Body temperature was monitored continuously during the procedure with a rectal probe attached to a thermocouple (TRACEABLE Digital Thermometer, VWR). A heating blanket (K&amp;H Lectro-Kennel<sup>TM</sup> heated Pad &amp; Cover) was used to maintain body temperature between 36°C–39°C.</li>
<li>Betadine was applied with sterile gauze to the surgical area and allowed to dry (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B). A sterile, adhesive drape (3M) was used as a barrier on the surgical site.</li>
<li>Under sterile conditions, a left thoracotomy in the fourth intercostal space was performed (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>A–5D) to expose the heart (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>E). Then the pericardium was opened and LAD was identified (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>F–5I). A 4-0 taper-needled silk suture was passed beneath a major branch of the left coronary artery, perpendicular to the vessel (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>J and 5K).

<li>To estimate a risk area of nearly 25%, the suture was slightly lifted against a cotton-tip applicator to briefly test the coronary occlusion (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>J).</li>
<li>A balloon occluder (using Tygon tubing) attached with the aluminum sheet [0.2–0.3 mm thick] was placed on top of the coronary artery and secured with the 4-0 silk suture on the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>L–5N)</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> (a) Careful placement of the balloon is critical for a later successful conscious ischemia induction, i.e. the suture knot should not be too tight (which would cause blood flow restriction after balloon deflation) or too loose (which would fail to induce complete coronary occlusion during balloon inflation). (b) Proper function of the occluder should be confirmed by the appearance of cyanosis (bluish or grayish color) of the distal myocardium upon brief inflation of the balloon (10 s) and hyperemia after deflation (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>O and 5P).</div>
<ol start="23">
<li>Lungs were inflated using an Ambu bag (Spur II Pediatric Resuscitation bag, Ambu®).</li>
<li>The surgical incision in the chest was closed according to the standard procedures. Briefly, pericardium was closed using 4-0 silk suture, rib was closed using 0 Perma-Hand<sup>TM</sup> silk suture, muscle and skin were closed with 3-0 monofilament suture (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>Q–5Y). Only a few millimeters of the incision was left accessible for catheter retrieval.</li>
<li>The occluder tubing was then tunneled under the skin, and exteriorized through a small incision between the scapulae (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>T–5W).</li>
<li>Prior to closing the chest, a sterile chest tube was placed to remove fluid and air to avoid a pneumothorax (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>X and 5Y).</li>
<li>Triple-antibiotic (Neosporin) ointment was applied after the surgery (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>Y).</li>
<li>Rabbit was extubated after waking from anesthesia by checking their eyeball movement to light and diaphragm movement for abdominal breathing.

</li>
<li>To alleviate discomfort, rabbits received ketoprofen (3.0 mg/kg; i.m.) and diazepam (4 mg/kg; i.m.) separately 2 h before inflating the balloon for inducing ischemia.</li>
<li>The ear was cleaned with sterile ethanol pads. A venous line was established by placing a 24-gauge angiocatheter on a marginal ear vein to draw blood samples and administer drugs. Under local anesthesia (Lidocaine Hydrochloride Jelly USP, 2%), the ear dorsal artery was cannulated with a 24-gauge angiocatheter to monitor arterial pressure (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B).</li>
<li>Under sedation, rabbits were subjected to a 45-min coronary artery occlusion (to induce 45 min of ischemia) by inflating the pre-implanted hydraulic balloon occluder. After 45 min of ischemia, the hydraulic balloon was deflated to allow reperfusion for 3 days.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Vital cardiac parameters including mean arterial pressure, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and heart rate were monitored throughout the conscious I/R procedure via a transducer sensor probe secured to arterial line of the ear connected to Blood Pressure Analyzer (BPA, Digi-Med, KY USA).</div>
<ol start="36">
<li>Blood sample (0.5 mL) was collected in heparinized tube (BD-vacutainer- Gel- blood collection tubes - Becton, Dickinson and Company) at base line and at 1, 2, 4 and 24 h of reperfusion. Blood in the tube was centrifuged to separate plasma using Thermo Scientific Sorvall Legend XTR centrifuge at 2000g for 10 min under refrigerated condition (4°C). The plasma was stored at -20°C to measure cardiac troponin (cTnI).</li>
<li>Rabbit was transferred to the recovery unit and continuously monitored until they awoke (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). The rabbit was closely monitored to ensure adequate breathing and to prevent hypothermia and dehydration. If animal will encounter severe breathing problem, it will be again intubated and mechanically ventilated with oxygen enriched air. Visual signs of dehydration are not easy to detect during the course of surgery under anesthesia. After completion of ischemia, the rabbit was monitored for dehydration by checking symptoms such as the sticky saliva, crusty eyes or dark color urine. To avoid dehydration and compensate the blood loss/withdrawal, saline (5 mL/h) was injected intravenously during surgery and post-op recovery period. Animal was provided with unrestricted supply of drinking water in recovery chamber as well as vivarium.</li>
<li>When animal was fully awoken, i.e., when they could stand on their legs and start moving without imbalance, the rabbit was transported back to the vivarium with normal food and drinking water.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>We have established a preclinical cardiac research platform based on the advanced experimental models of I/R in conscious diabetic rabbits, which could offer reliable diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic information with higher confidence to facilitate translational research in diabetic patients with AMI. Rabbit heart closely resembles to human heart in terms of collateral circulation (<a href="#bib11">Seiler et al., 2013</a>). Another advantage is that the conscious rabbit myocardial I/R model avoided the confounding effects of anesthetics as well as the stress imposed by acute opening and closing of the chest for performing coronary artery occlusions. Considering its low cost, ease of handling and housing (compared to the large animals such as pigs and dogs), the rabbit has been one of the most commonly used experimental animals for studying complex diseases, such as diabetes and for developing novel therapeutic interventions (<a href="#bib3">Graur et al., 1996</a>). Rabbits are phylogenetically similar to humans than mice and rats. Therefore, the model we developed here can be reliably used in discovering novel therapeutic strategies for cardioprotection in diabetes as well as diabetic cardiomyopathy. Relative to rats and mice, their larger size greatly facilitates surgical procedures (implantation of balloon to conduct I/R under conscious sedation) with minimum postsurgical complications. Following are the successful outcomes of the current protocol:</p>
<h3 id="sec4.1">Development of a reliable diabetic (T1D) rabbit model with alloxan treatment</h3>
<p>Out of total 63 rabbits, 53 rabbits had blood glucose level greater than 220 mg/dL, which were considered as diabetic (average glucose level was 339.6±11.8 mg/dl as indicated by red line in <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>). The success rate of induction of diabetes was 84.1% with 9.5% mortality after alloxan treatment (6 out of 63 rabbits died after alloxan treatment).</p>

<h3 id="sec4.2">Reduction of infarct size in diabetic heart by treatment with rapamycin</h3>
<p>Histological measurement of myocardial infarct region in the post-MI tissue sections of the LV is a standard approach to assess the efficacy of a potent pharmacotherapy against AMI. Using myocardial I/R injury in conscious diabetic rabbit, this study demonstrates the infarct limiting effect of Rapamycin in diabetic rabbits (<a href="#fig12">Figure12</a>).</p>

<p>Cardiac-specific TnI concentrations in the plasma is considered as the cornerstones for MI and risk stratification.

<h3 id="sec4.5">Rapamycin treatment attenuates myocardial apoptosis</h3>
<p>Apoptosis, occurs predominantly in the peri-infarcted region, plays an important role in the myocardial loss after AMI. Inhibition of apoptosis with a therapeutic intervention could improve prognosis of patients with AMI. There was significant increase in TUNEL-positive nuclei in cardiomyocytes of the peri-infarct regions in the diabetic hearts following I/R as compared to the non-diabetic hearts (<a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a>). Reperfusion with Rapamycin reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in diabetic hearts.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>The infarct size was quantified using image J software (Bethesda, NIH, USA). Data was exported to Excel format and calculated.</li>
<li>The echocardiography images were analyzed using Vevo LAB 3.2.0 software.</li>
<li>The absorbance of 450 nm for cardiac TnI assay was recorded using Molecular Devices VERSA max microplate reader and SoftMax® Pro Software Version 5. The data was exported to Excel format and calculation of cTnI in each sample was calculated using the standard curve prepared with cTnI (1.25, 0.625, 0.312, 0.156, 0.078, 0.039 and 0.019 ng/mL).</li>
<li>The pictures of cardiac sectioning after TUNEL staining and counter staining with Troponin and DAPI were captured using a confocal microscope (Nikon D-Eclipse C1). The apoptotic cardiomyocytes (TUNEL positive nuclei: green and Troponin staining: red striation) and total cells (with DAPI-blue nuclei) were counted and the data was plotted in Excel format to calculate the percentage of apoptotic cells to total cells.</li>
<li>Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc. La Jolla, CA). The data are presented as mean±SE for each treatment group, along with unadjusted 2-tailed p values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. One-way ANOVA + Bonferroni post-hoc test was used for unpaired data to compare 3 groups, respectively. The difference between two groups was analyzed via Student’s t-test.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The long-term effects of diabetes on rabbit heart following myocardial injury was not examined in the current protocol. The E/A ratio (the ratio of peak velocity blood flow from LV relaxation in early diastole (the E wave) to peak velocity flow in late diastole caused by atrial contraction (the A wave)) could not be evaluated, which would have provided early indications of diastolic dysfunction in the T1D rabbits.</p>
<p>Respiratory rate has an impact on cardiac function during echocardiography measurement. In this study, respiratory rate during echocardiography was not accurately measured. During echocardiography, rabbits were not anaesthetized (using ketamine, Xylazine and Atropine), which could affect their respiration; they were sedated using isoflurane (adjusted at 2.5–3.5%).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Difficulty to induce T1D in rabbit.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Rabbits whose blood glucose levels remain &lt;220 mg/dL following 7 days of the initial injection of alloxan should receive a second dose of alloxan (100  mg/kg; i.v.) under light sedation as previously described procedure of the induction of T1D in rabbit. The monitoring parameters should be similar to the post-alloxan monitoring procedures listed above until the end of the study. It is essential to freshly prepare the alloxan solution before administration. Precise dose of alloxan solution should be injected into the ear vein. After second dose of alloxan administration, animal should be monitored closely, specifically the body weight was examined at least once every 48 h. If blood glucose level exceeds 450 mg/dL, rabbits should be injected with insulin to control glucose level as previously described.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Adverse effect during I/R in conscious rabbit.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Hemodynamics should be monitored to assess the vital cardiac parameters including mean arterial pressure, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and heart rate at baseline and throughout the conscious ischemia and reperfusion (1 and 2 h) via a transducer sensor probe secured to arterial line of rabbit ear connected to Blood Pressure Analyzer (BPA, Digi-Med, KY USA). We normally exclude rabbits from the study if blood pressure drops below 30 % and does not return to normal levels during the period of monitoring. We do not administer any vasopressor (e.g., norepinephrine) because they can potentially interfere with the interpretation of our results of ischemia/reperfusion injury and cardioprotection with rapamycin. For example, the administration of norepinephrine activates alpha-adrenergic receptor signaling in the heart which can potentially trigger preconditioning like cardioprotective effect as previously published from our laboratory several years ago (<a href="#bib13">Tejero-Taldo et al., 2002</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Post-surgical complication due to balloon implantation or I/R injury.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The rabbits should be closely monitored post-surgery of balloon implantation to assess their overall behavior, responsiveness, eating/drinking, urination until sacrifice. If any indication of discomfort is noticed, the animal should be immediately sacrificed and excluded from the study. After balloon implantation, cardiac function should be assessed by performing echocardiography. If there is severe cardiac dysfunction, the rabbits should be excluded from the study.</p>
