<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells exhibit distinct spike patterns in different environments called “remapping,” and we have recently shown that remapping of place cells becomes disrupted in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we describe our protocol for investigating remapping of place cells and grid cells using a custom-made electrophysiology device, with detailed descriptions and problem-solving tips for the construction and implantation of the recording device. We also provide steps for behavioral training, recording, and data analysis.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00465-2/sref8">Jun et al. (2020).</a></p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>In this protocol, we describe a method for investigating remapping using a knock-in mouse model for Alzheimer’s disease (APP<sup>NL-</sup><sup>G-</sup><sup>F</sup> model, (<a href="#bib24">Saito et al., 2014</a>)). Our method can be applied to any mouse models for testing remapping of place cells. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Irvine. Mice aged between 3- to 12-month-old were used for our experiments, and similar number of female and male mice was used.</p>

<p>Construct and surgically implant a multielectrode drive for electrophysiological recordings.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Construct a custom-built 64-channel drive as described previously (<a href="#bib2">Brunetti et al., 2014</a>, <a href="#bib15">Liang et al., 2017</a>) to target the CA1 of the hippocampus and superficial layer of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>)
<ol type="a">
<li>Form 6 cm 2 × 2 bundle with outer polymide (30G) tubing.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Try to minimize the gap between each polymide tubing to minimize the size of the bundle.</div>
</li>
<li>Cut this bundle at the middle to create two 3 cm 2 × 2 bundles. (One will be used for CA1 of the hippocampus and another will be used for MEC)</li>
<li>Two separate bundles, with one targeting CA1 of the hippocampus and another targeting the medial entorhinal cortex, are separated by a distance of 2.5–2.7 mm with height difference 0.8–1.2 mm.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Attach these bundles to the core using the sticky rubber and little by little modify their positions manually until desired positions are achieved.</div>
</li>
<li>Affix the bundles with position mentioned above to the drive core using epoxy and cure overnight to ensure epoxy is completely fixed.</li>
<li>Place the spring and shuttle through shaft of microscrew and screw it down to four holes on each side. Have each microscrew placed apart by at least one hole so that they are evenly spread out.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> There are eight holes on each side, but only four holes will be used, because there will be eight tetrodes inserted (double packing) into four cannulas. In contrast to previous work (<a href="#bib15">Liang et al., 2017</a>) where 34G was used to create the bundle, we use 30G as this is the smallest and durable tubing that we can get it to work without getting it bent during turning.</div>
</li>
<li>Prepare at least eight 0.5 cm anchor polymide (20G) tubing and thread this through each outer tubing (34G). Bring the anchor tubing (20G) and place it inside the guide hole located front of each screw to align outer tubing (30G) to each shuttle. Affix the position of anchoring tube with epoxy.</li>
<li>Prepare at least eight 3 cm inner polymide (34G) tubing and thread them through outer tubing (30G) and have the 34G tubing affixed to the shuttle using epoxy (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Pay close attention to determine whether inner tubing (34G) can smoothly thread through the outer tubing (30G). There should be no bending nor extra force needed to push inner tubing (34G) through the outer tubing (30G). If any bending is noticed, repeat step e-g at unused adjacent holes for replacement.</div>
</li>
<li>Attach the 64-channel EIB board on top of the drive core.</li>
<li>Thread tetrodes through inner tubing and connect to the EIB board using gold pins. Place two tetrodes per tubing.</li>

<p>The description below is a method specific to drive implantation in mice. For those who are not familiar to general survival surgery in rodents, watch a video in Geiger et al. (<a href="#bib6">Geiger et al., 2008</a>).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Implantation Surgery
<ol type="a">
<li>Begin anesthetizing animals by placing them inside an induction chamber with 2%–3% isoflurane mixed with oxygen flow 0.8–1.0 L/min.</li>
<li>Administer subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine (working solution 0.015 mg/mL; dose 0.2 mL/20 g) at the start of surgery.</li>
<li>Place animals on stereotaxic stage with correct ear bar placement for head fixation.</li>
<li>Continue anesthetizing mice with reduced isoflurane content (oxygen flow: 0.8–1.0 L/min, 1%–1.5% isoflurane)</li>
<li>Animal’s temperature is closely monitored and regulated at 37.0°C throughout the surgery using the thermoregulator system.</li>
<li>Perform a craniotomy that is sufficiently large for electrode implantation (1.5 mm × 1.5 mm) (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a>)
<ol type="i">

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>When the methods have been successfully executed, experimenters should be able to detect about ∼50% of principal neurons from CA1 as place cells in WT group. When the tetrode has successfully hit CA1 pyramidal cell layer, it is expected that at least ∼15–30 units can be obtained from 8 tetrodes per mouse. As for the superficial layer of MEC, at least ∼5–15 units will be obtained from 8 tetrodes per mouse. The chance of hitting the CA1 layer with four independently movable tetrodes is high. The experimenter should be able to have at least one of the tetrodes reaching CA1 layer in ∼75% of animals. The chance of hitting the superficial layer of MEC with 8 tetrodes is slightly lower compared to that of hitting CA1. Experimenters should be able to have at least one of the tetrodes reaching the superficial layer of MEC in ∼50% of animals. Because the chance of hitting CA1 and MEC with all tetrodes is relatively low, experimenters are expected to record from at least five to ten animals in each group for obtaining &gt;50 units in both CA1 and MEC. A recording session with recommended parameters should produce a file with size ranging from 5 – 15 GB: 500MB - 1 GB for spike data per tetrode and ∼500 MB of video tracking file.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>For comparing the values such as spatial information between WT and AD groups, we recommend performing all statistical testing with non-parametric distribution and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. For comparing the distribution of place cells and population vector correlation values, we recommend Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests. All statistical methods used are summarized in Supplementary Tables S2 from our previous article (<a href="#bib8">Jun et al., 2020</a>). In these analyses, we tested the null hypothesis that properties of neurons from WT animals, such as spatial information and spatial correlation values between different tracks do not differ from those of neurons from the AD group.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Despite significant advances in our understanding of brain function allowed by the tetrodes, these fundamental and basic recording probes have limitations.</p>
<p>The first major limitation concerns the tetrode’s position as it moves toward the target brain region. To reach the target area, tetrodes need to be turned daily to avoid becoming stuck. However, once reaching the target region, tetrodes are not guaranteed to remain at that exact position across days. Some tetrodes will inevitably fall out of the cell layer. Therefore, it is almost impossible to record from the target region for long periods exceeding 1–2 weeks. These confounding issues along with many other factors such as recovery days and training days need to be carefully considered to successfully acquire neural data at the time of the testing experiment.</p>
<p>The second limitation revolves around the nature of the recording method. Our current drive allows 64 channels (16 tetrodes), which limits the number of sampled units. Experimenters may want to consider using higher-yield electrodes such as Neuropixels (<a href="#bib9">Jun et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib27">Steinmetz et al., 2021</a>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Animals take longer than 10 days to fully recover (step 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The two most frequently occurring issues that hamper animal’s ability to fully recover include: 1) prolonged infection and 2) extra dental cement protruding backwards from the headplate. In the case of prolonged infection, make sure to constantly monitor animal’s condition and administer necessary medications with supplements to improve their health. It is highly recommended to administer medication daily for at least the initial week after surgery. If extra dental cement protrusion is detected, experimenters are recommended to remove it with a dental drill under isoflurane-anesthesia.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Animals freeze during open field exploration or linear track tasks (steps 10 and 11).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To avoid issues with sampling any artifacts from place cell and grid cell recording, it is imperative that animal is constantly moving to cover as much area as possible in the open field box and to run back and forth in the linear tracks. For open field, make sure that animal is not running in a circular motion. Encourage the animals by placing cookie crumbs. During the linear tracks, make sure to have the animal running in only one direction except turning at the ends. Lastly, handle mice daily to reduce anxiety.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Artifact light disrupting appropriate tracking of animal’s movement (steps 10 and 11).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A compatible video tracking system is installed to align spike data with animal’s position in the Neuralynx system. LEDs installed on the headstage are used to track the animal’s movement. Therefore, appropriate parameters and threshold must be applied and tested to make sure only the LED is being detected during the neural data acquisition. Prior to every recording session, make sure to eliminate any light source that may add noise to the video tracking system.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Data analysis is extremely slow or freezes (steps 12–16).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A single successful recording session can take between 1.5 h–3.0 h to process. The data file may exceed 20 GB. Some analyses involve heavily repeated computations that may require significant time. To reduce time and increase efficiency, we recommend using a computer that has &gt; 128 GB of RAM.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Animal doesn’t wake up from recovery (Animal recovery problem)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This happens when animals are exposed too long with isoflurane. Have no more than 10–15 min for initial knock-down with 3% isoflurane. Complete the surgery within 3 h.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Setting up the recording system is challenging (general problem)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The recording system is quite challenging to set up and beginners require input from seasoned in vivo electrophysiologist to properly have the system installed. On top of this, downloading and using analysis software such as MClust can be difficult. Therefore, we highly advise beginner experimenters to seek professional help from experts who routinely use in vivo electrophysiology techniques to study entorhinal-hippocampal circuit.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Tetrodes seem not to be moving (general problem)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>As days progress from implantation, there is an increased likelihood that tetrodes can get stuck. This is due to many factors including blood clotting around implantation site, regrowth of skull, and etc. If the experimenters notice that cell clusters identified from tetrodes aren’t changing after turning, we recommend turning tetrodes slightly more to exert greater force on their movement.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.15">Problem 8</h3>
<p>Drive falls off from animal (general problem)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.16">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the dental cement is not applied properly, the Microdrive can fall off from the animal’s skull due to poor adhesion. Common issues with poor adhesion arise from applying dental cement on skull without adequately scratching or not completely drying the surface of skull. Therefore, it is highly recommended that careful approach is taken to completely affix drive to the skull during dental cement application step.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.17">Problem 9</h3>
<p>LFP signal is incredibly noisy (recording problem)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.18">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Placement of ground wire is critical for acquiring quality spike and LFP data. If the experimenter notices that either spike or LFP signal is noisy, make sure that they are being referenced by unbroken channel. Often, ground wire can become damaged if it becomes exposed as the animal may be able to scratch it. To prevent this from occurring, make sure that ground wire is fully embedded inside the dental cement during implantation so that it is well protected. Lastly, make sure that ground wire is securely pinned to the drive.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.19">Problem 10</h3>
<p>Spike clusters are unstable and move between recording sessions (recording problem)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.20">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Despite excellent design of Microdrive to control for stability of tetrodes, drastic movements may cause tetrodes to move between recording sessions. Therefore, we recommend minimizing any tension on cables to avoid any potential stress that it might place on the drive. Make sure to use counterweight to balance out the weight of cable and drive during the experiment. Lastly, minimize cable plugging in and out. Try to plug in and out only once per day.</p>
