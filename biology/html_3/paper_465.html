<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The origin of basal cell carcinomas (BCC) remains elusive. This protocol combines the use of an ultraviolet (UV)-inducible BCC murine model (K14CrexPtch<sup>wt/lox</sup>) and an optimized protocol for florescent whole-mount cytokeratin 17 immunostaining to address the spatiotemporal dynamics of BCC formation. The high-resolution three-dimensional confocal images are an excellent tool to visualize and quantify the distribution of skin cancers at a given time point.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib4">Roy et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>Our previous protocols published in 2019 (<a href="#bib5">Roy and Khosrotehrani, 2019</a>) have focused on analyzing the spatiotemporal organization of epidermal stem cells, the current protocol is optimized and adapted for use with BCC murine samples.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">KRT14Cre/ER x Ptch1wt/lox mice: tamoxifen induction and UVR treatments</h3>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Treatments were adapted from a method previously described (<a href="#bib3">Cozzi et al., 2012</a>).</div>
<ol>
<li>Prepare tamoxifen for intraperitoneal (IP) injection at 10 mg/mL in 90% corn oil and 10% absolute ethanol.</li>
<li>At 8 weeks of age (mix gender animals), inject 100 μL (1 mg) of tamoxifen intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days using a 25-gauge needle. This allows the inducible Cre/lox system to invalidate one allele of the <i>Ptch1</i> gene.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> No BCC lesions were observed after the invalidation of one <i>Ptch1</i> allele.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Three days after the last injection of tamoxifen, mice are shaved using an electric shaver to remove all hairs from the back (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, step 1). Shave as close to the skin as possible while being careful to avoid nicks.</li>
<li>Start UV treatment by placing each mouse in an individual compartment (L × H=11.5 × 20 cm) of the box (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The mice are 20 cm below the UV lamps receiving therefore a dose of 0.8 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> per minute. The treatment starts with 1.5 min of exposure and the time is increased 0.5 min every 2 weeks (<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>).

<h3 id="sec3.1">Buffer preparation</h3>
<p>Preparation of solutions to perform whole-mount immunostaining.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixation solution: 4% formaldehyde. For 1 L of 4% formaldehyde, heat 800 mL of PBS to 60°C in a beaker and keep it on heat plate at 60°C in a ventilated hood. Add 40 g of paraformaldehyde powder to the heated PBS solution. Slowly raise the pH to 7 by adding 1 N NaOH dropwise from a pipette until the solution clears. Once the paraformaldehyde is dissolved, adjust the volume of the solution to 1 L with PBS. The solution can be aliquoted and frozen or stored at 2°C–8°C for up to 1 month.</li>
<li>20% sucrose solution: For 200 mL of 20% sucrose, add 200 mL of 1× PBS to a glass beaker on a stir plate. Add 40 g of sucrose powder to the PBS solution. Stir until dissolved. Stored at 2°C–8°C for up to 1 month.</li>
<li>Blocking solution: 1× PBS, 0.5% Triton X, 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20% normal goat serum (NGS), 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 100 mM maleic acid (pH 7.5). For 10 mL of blocking solution, dissolve 0.2 g of BSA in 6.85 mL of PBS, then add 50 μL of Triton X, 2 mL of NGS, 100 μL of DMSO, and 1 mL of 1 M maleic acid (pH 7.5).</li>
<li>Diluent solution: 1× PBS, 0.5% Triton X, 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 100 mM maleic acid (pH 7.5). For 10 mL of diluent solution, dissolve 0.2 g of BSA in 8.85 mL of PBS, then add 50 μL of Triton X, 100 μL of DMSO, and 1 mL of 1 M maleic acid (pH 7.5).</li>
<li>Washing solution: 1× PBS, 0.5% Triton X, 0.5% Tween 20. For 1 L of washing solution, add 5 mL of Triton X and 5 mL Tween 20 in 990 mL of PBS.</li>
<li>4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution: For 1 mL DAPI solution, add 1 μL of DAPI in 999 μL of 1× PBS (1/1000 from a 14.3 M DAPI stock solution).</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>A successful experiment should show a clear image of your staining from the top to the bottom of your tissue. A Z stack of 150 μm can be acquired without any problems. Most of the time a Z stack of 200 μm should be easy to acquire. The background should be minimal. An example can be found in <a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a> and <a href="#fig7">7</a>.</p>

<p>Note that a very important step to reduce the background is the washing step. Also, the background is also minimized using the appropriate blocking solution. The origin (species in which it is produced) of the serum used in the blocking solution has to match with the animal in which the secondary antibody is produced. Here, the goat serum is used as the secondary antibody is produced in the goat.</p>
<p>If possible, it is also recommended to choose monoclonal antibodies to limit the background. The incubation of primary antibody plays also an important role in the background optimization. If background is observed, the incubation time of the primary antibody might be optimized. In this protocol, a balance between a good staining and a minimum of background is obtained with an incubation between 14 h and 16 h of the primary antibody.</p>
<p>This protocol allows the visualization of BCC lesion size, their attachment to hair follicles, their characterization.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>DAPI fluorescence stains for cell nuclei and anti-K17 antibody stains for BCCs (<a href="#bib2">Anderson-Dockter et al., 2012</a>). K17 is also a marker for hair follicles, however they are distinguishable from BCCs due to their morphology (<a href="#bib1">Alessi et al., 2008</a>). Co-localization of these markers (DAPI and K17) is indicative of BCC lesions.</p>
<p>NB: The investigators are blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Z stack images are taken, using FV3000 Olympus confocal microscope, across all skin samples of any area where DAPI and K17 appeared to co-localize, in order to determine total number of BCCs across the skin for each mouse.</li>
<li>Z stack images are combined using ImageJ, whereby individual image slices of skin are compiled in order to create a movie. This allowed for analysis across the whole depth of skin to identify BCCs.</li>
<li>The number of BCC lesions per Z stack movie are counted manually.</li>
<li>Data was pooled in order to determine the number of BCC lesions/mm<sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li>To compare lesion size, the number of cells making up the BCCs identified within each sample of skin is counted manually using the Cell Counter plugin in Fiji software.</li>
<li>Data are analyzed through the GraphPad Prism v7.oa software. However, any statistic software may be used for this analysis. A p value of less than 0.05 is deemed significant.
<ol type="a">
<li>Lesion number, size, attachment to hair follicles and characteristics (ex: cycling status) are reported for each time point.</li>
<li>Lesion number/size are averaged and compared between groups using two-tailed t tests or Mann-Whitney test.</li>
<li>Lesion number/size distributions are compared between conditions using Chi square tests</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This staining protocol is not restricted to one primary antibody. Additional staining may be performed to further characterize the BCC lesions. [e.g., anti-cytokeratin 14 (basal keratinocyte marker), BrdU (proliferative or quiescent cell marker depending if proliferative or label retaining cell experiment is performed) <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>, <a href="#bib4">Roy et al., 2020</a>].</div>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Despite its benefits, clonal dynamics evaluation upon lineage tracing only offers a static view of the skin of different animals at different time points and models proposed so far, including ours, heavily rely on computer simulations and mathematical modeling that make unverifiable assumptions.</p>
<p>Lineage tracing model combined with the live imaging multiphoton microscopy to directly visualize dynamics of epidermal clones or tumors should strengthen our ability to better understand epidermal proliferation dynamics and tumor development without any assumption.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Exposure to depilatory cream can damage the surface of the skin and remove a part of the superficial epidermal cells. It will lead to the loss of information.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use cream for sensitive skin and do not leave the depilatory cream for more than 2 min to avoid damaging the skin. Reapply if necessary. Rinse abundantly.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Fixation will cause tissue to harden. Wrinkled/unflatten skin will cause difficulty in mounting and imaging in later steps.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Flatten the collected skin on a supporting material such as a piece of plastic before putting the sample in the fixative solution. Avoid fixing the tissue more than 2 h will prevent this problem.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Prolonged incubation in clearing buffer will harden the tissue and lead to difficulty in mounting.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Regular checking (every half an hour) is important to prevent this problem. If the aspect of the tissue does not change between 2 observations, the tissue has to be removed from the clearing buffer and mounted on slide.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Skin tissue is difficult to clear when it is in anagen phase (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, the growing phase of the hair follicles) compared to the telogen phase (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, resting phase of the hair follicle).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The skin in anagen phase is thicker and require a longer incubation in the clearing solution. The use of multiphoton microscope can also help as the laser penetrate deeper in the tissue.</p>
