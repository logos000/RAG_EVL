<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Here, we describe a protocol to simultaneously record and label single cortical neurons <i>in vivo</i> under local application of a chemical such as a receptor agonist. This protocol provides a useful tool to investigate how the chemical of interest affects the processing of sensory information by cortical neurons. The juxtacellular labeling allows identification of the cell type and morphology of the recorded neurons. We draw examples to show pharmacological modulations in encoding of vibrotactile stimuli in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Kheradpezhouh et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Pair-pipettes assembly</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>This part involves preparing two different types of pipettes: (1) a <i>recording</i> pipette for juxtacellular recording and labeling, and (2) an <i>infusion</i> pipette for local infusion of solutions, as well as (3) the method for connecting the two pipettes together (pipette pairing; <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A).</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Pipette pair assembly</div>
<p>(A) The produced pipette pair visualized under a microscope.</p>
<p>(B) Custom-made setup for pipette pair assembly. Pipettes are secured in the clamps; the recoding pipette is secured in the vertical clamp (Manipulator 1) and the infusion pipette is secured in the horizontal clamp (Manipulator 2) which moves back and forth as well as left to right. Under microscopic visualization and using Z nub, we first vertically align the recoding pipette with the infusion pipette; then, using nubs X (for back and forth movement) and Y (for left and right movement), the infusion pipette is juxtaposed to the recoding pipette. Finally, the pipettes are fixed together using a hot glue gun.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol>
<li>Recording pipette
<ol type="a">
<li>We use Sutter Micropipette Puller (Model P-97) and Capillary Glasses with 1.5 mm outer diameter (OD) and 0.86 mm inner diameter (ID).</li>
<li>Pull pipettes in 4 steps to produce a tip diameter of ∼0.5–1 μm with a resistance of 5–10 MOhm.</li>
<li>Check the pipette under 10× magnification of a microscope to verify the proper tip diameter is achieved.</li>
<li>Secure the pipette in an electrode storage jar.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Infusion pipette
<ol type="a">
<li>We use the same puller and 2 mm OD capillary glass pipettes. Pipettes are pulled in 1 step to make a long narrow tip. Using a pair of fine forceps, break 1–2 mm of the tip of the pipette to achieve a tip diameter of 20–50 μm.</li>
<li>Check the pipette under 10× magnification of a microscope to verify the proper tip diameter.</li>
<li>Secure the pipette in an electrode storage jar.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Adjust your program to make long narrow tips. This would minimize the damage induced by insertion of the paired pipette.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Pipette pair
<ol type="a">
<li>We have custom built a setup for pairing recoding and infusion pipettes (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B).</li>
<li>Secure the recording pipette in the vertically-moving (Z axis) manual manipulator (Manipulator 1, <a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>B and 1C) and the infusion pipette in the horizontally moving (X and Y axes) manipulator (Manipulator 2, <a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>B and 1D).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Manipulators 1 and 2 are parts of a manual manipulator (Narishige MM-3 Micromanipulator) separated to move independently.</div>
</li>
<li>Hold the infusion pipette with a pair of forceps and attach ∼5 mm of tubing on the non-tapered end of the pipette.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This step helps the infusion pipette to attach to the tube originating from syringes and prevents the leakage.</div>
</li>
<li>First position the pipettes parallel to each other using vertical manipulator.</li>
<li>Under microscope visualization, juxtapose the tips of pipettes using horizontal manipulators. Keep the pipettes at a 35°–40° angle.</li>
<li>Unite the pipette pair using hot-glue gun at about 1 cm above the tips and leave them to set (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E).</li>
<li>Check the pipette pair again under the microscope to verify the tips are still juxtaposed and aligned.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps to prepare enough pipette pairs needed for your experiment.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The step of aligning the tips is critical. If the tips are not well aligned, the quality of the experiment will be compromised. If the tips have some distance between them or if they cross over, the infusion will not reach the recorded neuron. Misaligned tips also increase the risk of damage to the cortex during pipette insertion.</div>

<h3 id="sec3.2">Induction of anesthesia</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15 min</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Weigh the mouse on scale.</li>
<li>Anesthetize the mouse based on the protocol approved by the animal experimentation ethics committee. Below is the protocol we used.</li>
<li>Briefly anesthetize the mouse in isoflurane chamber for 2–5 min.</li>
<li>Administer 5 mL/kg of anesthetic solution intraperitoneally (ip).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For studying the sensory processing in mammalian cortex, different anesthetic drugs are used which sometimes vary depending on the modality of interest. Based on our experience, urethane/chlorprothixene mixture provides a stable level of general anesthesia suitable for studying neuronal responses in the rodent somatosensory cortex.</div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Keep the mouse on the heating blanket.</li>
<li>Check the anesthetic level after 10–15 min by pinching the hind paw; if the mouse is not fully anesthetized, ip inject an additional dose of anesthetic solution equivalent to 10% of original dosage. If the mouse is fully anesthetized move to the next step.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To achieve stable anesthesia by urethane, it is crucial that a correct ip injection is performed. Incorrect injection would result in slow absorption and may produce an unstable anesthesia.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.3">Head fixation and craniotomy</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>For head fixation we use a modified version of the setup described by Guo et al. (<a href="#bib1">Guo et al., 2014</a>). Here is a brief description of the head-fixation setup.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The body temperature control system is compromised under anesthesia. It is therefore critical to keep the mouse on heating blanket during all stages of the experiment.</div>

<li>Head fixation (in brief)Proper head fixation is crucial for having a stable long-lasting recording from single neurons.
<ol type="a">
<li>After ensuring that the mouse is fully anesthetized and while keeping the mouse on the heating blanket, remove the scalp to expose the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones.</li>
<li>Remove the periosteal tissue on the skull using forceps or by application of 1 mM hydrogen peroxide with a cotton bud.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Remember to remove the pieces of hair from the skull and thoroughly clean it.</div>

<ol start="11">
<li>Craniotomy
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The position of craniotomy varies depending on the sensory modality of interest. Here, we focus on the vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vS1).</div>
<ol type="a">
<li>Mark the middle of vS1 on the skull based on its coordinates (1.8 mm posterior to bregma and 3.5 mm lateral from the midline suture).</li>
<li>Draw a 2 mm circle around that point for craniotomy.</li>
<li>Drill along the circular mark using a drill bit with 0.3 mm blunt head.</li>
<li>Apply ACSF regularly to clean the drilling area for better visualization and to avoid overheating the bone.</li>
<li>When the bone flap gets loose, it can be lifted up with a pair of forceps held horizontal to the skull.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Drill patiently while applying constant pressure. Drilling in one direction, either clockwise or anti-clockwise helps maintaining the uniformity of drilling and reduces the possibility of damaging the dura.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Remove the bone debris powder by flushing with ACSF and suctioning.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> During this step, the bone may be detached from some areas but need more drilling in others. It is helpful to gently touch the bone flap with forceps to identify the areas that need further drilling.</div>
</li>
<li>In case of accidental damage to a blood vessel see <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting 1</a>.</li>
<li>You need to keep the cortex always moist with regular application of ACSF.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> At this stage, it is a good idea to fix the ground wire for electrophysiological recording. The wire should be placed away from the craniotomy area. We recommend inserting the wire between the muscles and the exposed skull.</div>

<p>You can use any pump to continuously inject the solution at rates of 1–10 μL/min. Here we use CMA 402 Syringe pumps and 1 mL glass syringes. We use 4 pumps and 4 syringes, 2 syringes for ACSF, 1 syringe each for agonist and antagonist solutions. Adjust the number of pumps based on the number of solutions. The tubes need to be connected at the infusion pipette level and transferred with a blunt needle gauge 21 to the tip of the infusion pipette (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A).</p>

<p>Here, we followed the protocol described by <a href="#bib4">Pinault, 1996</a> and modified in 2011 (<a href="#bib4">Pinault, 1996</a>, <a href="#bib5">2011</a>).</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Ensure that all the necessary equipment is connected and turned on. This includes amplifiers, sound system, micromanipulator, national instrument (NI) card and computers.</li>
<li>To penetrate the dura mater, apply constant pressure (of ∼300 mmHg) to the recording pipette and insert the pipette pair at a relatively fast speed of ∼100 μm/s.</li>
<li>After passing the dura, reduce the pressure to 10–20 mmHg and start searching for neurons at the slow speed of 1 μm/s. This can be done under current clamp mode with application of 1 nA pulses for 200 ms and 200 ms pause.</li>
<li>Continue the search until you identify a rise in impedance as the pipette comes in proximity of a neuron.</li>
<li>After reaching a neuron, remove the pressure and stop the current pulse.</li>
<li>Apply the sensory paradigm while recording the neuron. For example, in our experiments, we used a MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) script to present the stimuli and acquired the neuronal data through the analog input and output of a data acquisition card (National Instruments, Austin, TX). The whisker stimulation composed brief (20 ms) biphasic vertical movement generated by a piezoelectric actuator (<a href="#bib2">Kheradpezhouh et al., 2017</a>). The trials were presented in a pseudorandom order.</li>
<li>Apply agonist or antagonist by switching between the pumps.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We applied the drugs for about 10–15 min each. This period should be optimized based on the specific drugs used in the experiment. In our experiments, it took 2–3 min for the drug to reach the neuron and we usually observed changes in neuronal response 5 min after switching between pumps.</div>
<ol start="27">
<li>After completing the experiment, load the neuron with neurobiotin as previously described (<a href="#bib4">Pinault, 1996</a>, <a href="#bib5">2011</a>). Here in brief:
<ol type="a">
<li>Apply 1-nA current pulses for 200 ms every 400 ms.</li>
<li>Increase the pulse amplitude 1 nA every 2–3 min until you observe the following changes in neuronal response which indicates the loading with neurobiotin.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Systematic rise in the neuronal firing rate and broadening the action potential duration are the main 2 signs of successful loading with neurobiotin (<a href="#bib4">Pinault, 1996</a>, <a href="#bib5">2011</a>). The other sign is the variability in amplitude and shape of neuronal action potential (<a href="#bib4">Pinault, 1996</a>, <a href="#bib5">2011</a>). These signs usually disappear after you stop the current injection and allowing the neuron to rest for a few minutes.</div>
<ol start="28">
<li>After loading the neuron, detach from the neuron by applying 10–20 mmHg of pressure to the recoding pipette and slowly retract the pipette pair.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If you want to record several neurons from each mouse, record the depth for each neuron to allow matching the recorded neurons with their histological reconstruction.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Successful Juxtacellular recording captures the spiking activity of each neuron in response to various levels of sensory stimulation in the presence or absence of pharmacological manipulation. Here, to show the expected results, we draw 2 example recordings from the whisker area of the primary somatosensory cortex. <a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>B and 4C illustrate the original response function of two example neurons to a range of whisker deflection amplitudes. Two example pharmacological modulations are shown: one for the transient receptor potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1, <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B) and one for M1 acetylcholine receptor (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>C).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Pharmacological modulation: Effective and precise pharmacological modulation depends on the arrival of the drug onto the recorded neuron. As the infusion rate is low and the extent of pharmacological modulation is local, appropriate alignment of the pipettes is crucial for this type of experiment.</p>
<p>Limited number of recordings can be performed on each animal, as the pipette pair penetration damages the cortex more than conventional juxtacellular recordings with a single pipette. We recommend a maximum of 3–4 penetrations.</p>
<p>Matching the recorded neuron with its histological reconstruction: The matching becomes progressively more difficult as one increases the number of recorded/labeled neurons in each mouse. We recommend maximum 3 recordings from each animal. Documenting the depth of recording will help to identify the neuron.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Bleeding due to dura damage during craniotomy (step 11)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Apply ACSF to the bleeding area continuously and suction till the bleeding stops.</p>
<p>If bleeding is severe, you can use Gelfoam to gently absorb blood and to stop the bleeding.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Noisy recording – Some common sources of noise (steps 20–27)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>All electrical devices can be a source of noise, including the lights, pumps, piezoelectric actuator, and the vacuum pumps. Check for any loose wiring around the setup and move the unnecessary equipment away from the recording set up.</p>
<p>Make sure all equipment are grounded.</p>
<p>Check the recording pipette carefully, as a slight damage to the pipette tip or its contamination can produce unstable recordings and noise. In this case, replace the pipette and try again.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Unable to find neurons (step 23)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check the recording pipette before penetration; replace with a fresh pipette pair if broken or blocked.</p>
<p>The speed of infusion might be too high and may result in pushing neurons away from the pipette. Consider reducing the speed. We usually recorded at the infusion rate of 2–7 μL/min.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Losing neurons (steps 26 and 27)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>After finding a neuron, if the amplitude of the recorded action potentials decreases over time, it could indicate that the infusion speed is too high. Consider reducing the speed of infusion by ∼0.5 μL/min or until the action potential amplitude is stabilized.</p>
<p>If reducing the speed does not solve the problem, consider replacing the pipette pair.</p>
<p>If the neuron is lost in the middle of a recording session, check the stability of the head fixation, anesthetic level, and look for potential pulsation movement in the brain.</p>
