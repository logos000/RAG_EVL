<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We recently integrated into fly genetics a set of four selection and two counterselection markers and their corresponding drugs that can be used individually or in combination. These markers eliminate the need to visually screen progeny. Before using these markers in new genetic backgrounds, effective selection/counterselection concentrations should be established for each marker/drug combination. This protocol describes how to set up, perform, and analyze a drug titration curve to determine the effective selection/counterselection drug concentrations for their corresponding markers.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109700">Matinyan et al., 2021</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>In a recent report, we developed a drug-based, selection and counterselection platform for multiplexed genetic manipulation in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> (<a href="#bib2">Matinyan et al., 2021</a>). We designed a compact expression cassette to test four different drug resistance and two drug sensitivity markers. We successfully selected resistant transgenic animals using the drugs G418 sulfate, puromycin, blasticidin S, and hygromycin B. We also demonstrated effective, drug-based counterselection against sensitized animals using either ganciclovir or 5-fluorocytosine. We then applied the selection/counterselection platform to make double transgenic animals in a single step, generated selectable and counterselectable balancer chromosomes, and made fluorescently tagged selectable <i>P[acman]</i> BAC transgenics (<a href="#bib2">Matinyan et al., 2021</a>). To facilitate expanding the platform to new applications, using it in different genetic backgrounds, or developing new markers that are resistant or sensitive to novel drugs, we provide a detailed protocol to perform drug titration curves to identify the optimal concentration for selection or counterselection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Expand the fly stocks you will be testing.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> A typical titration curve featuring vehicle control and ten drug concentration testing points consists of four replicate vials per drug condition each containing three female and three male flies, totaling 264 flies (132 female and 132 male). These numbers can be adjusted when designing a smaller curve or if using more flies per vial (We recommend at least 2 of each sex per vial).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In this protocol we demonstrate both a full eleven point titration curve and a second, smaller one. A smaller curve centered around the previously described effective selection or counterselection concentration for a given maker/drug combination (<a href="#bib2">Matinyan et al., 2021</a>) can also be carried out instead.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Order the EGFP control strain as well as the relevant drug marker expressing strains that were previously described (<a href="#bib2">Matinyan et al., 2021</a>).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The EGFP control strain and the relevant drug marker expressing strain will serve as negative and positive controls, respectively, while performing drug titration experiments to establish an effective selection concentration (ESC) or effective counterselection concetration (ECC) in the desired genetic background.</div>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For best results we recommend using younger flies no older than 3 weeks. Older flies tend to produce fewer offspring, which may lead to more variation between vials per point making results more difficult to interpret.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We perform all our selection/counterselection experiments in a 25°C incubator (12 h light-dark cycle, ambient humidity) to speed up larval development. However, the drug titration can be carried out between 18°C and 25°C, though temperatures lower than 25°C will prolong the length of the experiment.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Exposure to selection/counterselection agents slows down larval development by about a week, which can be somewhat offset by elevated temperature during development.</div>

<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> This protocol uses a large electric kitchen kettle to prepare fly food (up to 30 liters). Alternatively, for smaller amounts of fly food, a Crockpot that can be purchased from any department store can be used.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> This protocol uses a piston-driven pump to precisely and accurately dispense fly food (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B, <b>left</b>). However, an alternative is to use a Multipipette Repeater E3 (Eppendorf, 4987000118) alongside Combitips®, 50 mL (Eppendorf, 0030089596) (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B, <b>right</b>) to dispense food. Alternatively, if neither is available, we would recommend manually ladling food into vials, marked with a stripe indicating the height of the required volume of food, in a precise manner to ensure accurate fly food amount in all the vials.</div>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Drug titration experimental setup and workflow</div>
<p>(A) Design and construction of a homemade hole punching tool. The tool is made up of twenty 12” stainless-steel rods hot glued into two plastic discs made of kitchen cutting board material. Holes for the rods were made using a battery-operated electric drill (MATRIX™ Quick Connect System from Black &amp; Decker) and rods positioned in place before hot glueing by heating up the rods using a torch lighter. The discs were measured to be slightly bigger than the diameter of a standard fly vial and positioned in such a way that the rods reach only three-fourths of the way down into the food as a compromise between drug percolation and structural integrity of the food plug. The exact dimensions of the discs will depend on the type of vials used (i.e., wide versus narrow).</p>
<p>(B) Pictures of a quadruple piston pump (left), zoom in of a single piston pump unit (middle), and multipipette repeater with 50 mL and 5 mL combitips used for precise food or drug dispensing, respectively.</p>
<p>(C) Drugged food is prepared by first precisely and accurately dispensing 8 mL of fly food into a vial using a piston pump food dispenser (see B). Alternatively, food can be hand dispensed using a multipipette repeater and accompanying 50 mL combitip (see B). Once food is dispensed, it is allowed to air dry for at least 12 h covered by cheescloth before being hole punched using the homemade hole punching tool. Drug (see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>) is then dispensed using a multipipette repeater and accompanying 5 mL combitip (see B), and allowed to percolate as the vials dry another 48 h covered by cheesecloth, followed by plugging each vial. Adult flies, three of each sex per strain, are then added to vials and allowed to lay eggs for 1 week at 25°C before being removed. Larvae are then allowed to develop for an additional two weeks. Resulting adults, if any, are then counted and the data reported as normalized percent survival (see D).</p>
<p>(D) Simplified schematic of data analysis for resulting fly survival numbers from a drug titration experiment. Briefly, raw surviving fly numbers are tabulated (see <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>), and obvious outlier values which disagree with the other 3 biological replicates are pruned (orange) (see <a href="#tbl3">Tables 3</a> and <a href="#tbl4">4</a>). For each strain a mean fly survival number is calculated for vehicle control treated vials. All values for a given strain are then normalized to the vehicle control by dividing by this mean (see <a href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>). The effective selection concentration (ESC) or effective counterselection concentration (ECC) is determined after a 2-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons analysis (see <a href="#tbl5">Table 5</a>). Normalized values are then plotted with the ESC indicated in green (see example in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C), or the ECC indicated in purple (see example in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D). See the <a href="#quantification-and-statistical-analysis">quantification and statistical analysis</a> section for further details.</p>

<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> This protocol uses small stainless steel rods (0.5 mm diameter and 8–12’’ in length) to poke holes in the fly food vials prior to adding the drugs. As an alternative we have built a custom tool for faster and more reproducible hole punching of food vials using kitchen cutting board material and 20 12” stainless steel rods (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a><b>A</b>). Assembly of the tool is relatively simple and expedites hole punching the food.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>A successful drug titration experiment should yield a curve clearly showing the effective selection concentration (ESC) (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C), or effective counterselection concentration (ECC) (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D). We define the ESC as the minimal drug concentration at which the control (non-resistant) fly strain shows no viability while the corresponding marker expressing strain (resistant) is unaffected. Conversely, we define the ECC as the minimal drug concentration at which the sensitivity marker expressing strain is totally eliminated while the control strain (not sensitive) is unaffected. We recommend setting up at least 4 vials per concentration per strain per drug being tested to ensure that there will be at least three vials with fertile crosses allowing for robust statistical analysis (See <a href="#quantification-and-statistical-analysis">quantification and statistical analysis</a> section below). A typical experiment should yield values like the provided example values shown in <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>.</p>

<p class="table-legend">Surviving fly number counts from a typical drug titration curve for G418 sulfate. Values marked in bold with an asterisk denote excluded values deemed to be outliers based on the values of the three other vials for that condition and strain. These outlying values are pruned from the dataset.</p>
<p>Once the ESC/ECC has been determined for a drug in a particular genetic background, drug-based selection and/or counterselection should be robust, with only resistant animals surviving treatment (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C) or sensitized animals being eliminated (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D). As all six of the markers are dominantly expressed, a single copy is enough to confer drug resistance/sensitivity. Therefore, when crossing two backgrounds with different ESC/ECC, progeny should be selected for or counterselected against using the higher ESC/ECC, respectively. Similarly, if crossing to a strain with an unknown ESC/ECC for a particular drug, we recommend using the known drug concentration, modifying it for future crosses if escapers are noted among the progeny.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>A successful drug titration curve should yield raw values like those shown in <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>. For each vial, the total number of resulting flies after 3 weeks were counted and tabulated for each vial per concentration per strain. As mentioned above, on occasion a cross will not be fertile or will otherwise yield aberrant fecundity differing from the result of the other 3 vials. In these instances, we treat this value as an outlier (denoted in blue with an asterisk) and exclude it from further analysis. <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting 4</a>. Row statistics are then performed on pruned data to determine the mean of each row per group (strain tested). For each strain all non-excluded values are then normalized to corresponding vehicle control mean fly number by dividing all values by the mean of the vehicle control vials and then multiplied by 100 to yield the normalized percent survival values (<a href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>). The averaged values per concentration per strain are then graphed yielding survival curves as shown (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>C and 2D). Finally, we perform a 2-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons using Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, comparing each row average per strain to the corresponding vehicle control row average (<a href="#tbl5">Table 5</a>). This allows determination of the Effective selection/counterselection concentration (ESC/ECC) by ensuring that survival of the resistant (in the case of ESC) or the control (in the case of ECC) strain is not significantly different from vehicle control due to drug treatment at the putative ESC/ECC. <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting 5</a>.</p>

<p class="table-legend">Results of a multiple comparison test using Dunnett’s multiple comparison method. The mean of each of the non-excluded replicates per concentration per strain were compared to the mean of each strain’s respective vehicle control vials to determine if survival at a given drug concentration was significantly different from control. The row in bold represents the empirically determined effective selection concentration (ECC) for EGFP strain flies (EGFP). At this concentration, no control strain flies (EGFP) survive to adulthood while the survival of drug resistant strain flies (G418<sup>R</sup>) is not significantly affected compared to its respective vehicle control treated vials. If there are any missing values (pruned outliers), analysis will produce predicted least square (LS) means differences instead of mean difference. These represent the predicted difference between the observed mean and a mean based on a linear model such as a 2-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons analysis. The 95% confidence interval (CI) represents the range where difference between the two means will fall 95% of the time based on chance. If the actual value is outside this range it is deemed significant with P-value ≤ 0.05. Key: α = 0.05 ∗P &lt;0.05, ∗∗P &lt; 0.01, ∗∗∗P &lt; 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗P &lt; 0.0001, n.s. is non-significant.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol is meant to help establish a drug-based selection system for fly genetics in any lab as an alternative to screen-based genetics using visual markers (<a href="#bib3">Steller and Pirrotta, 1985</a>; <a href="#bib4">Venken and Bellen, 2007</a>). The only limitation is the need to perform titration or survival curves for each drug to establish an effective selection and/or counterselection concentration (ESC/ECC) in a given genetic background due to natural variation in drug resistance/sensitivity. Once established however, selection and/or counterselection genetic strategies can be readily employed. If multiple fly stocks, of differing backgrounds, are to be used in an experiment, it is recommended but not required to establish the required ESC(s) and/or ECC(s) for each stock. If ESC/ECC(s) are not established for all strains in a cross, we recommend simply setting up multiple crosses using the known drug concentration as well as vials drugged with slightly more and/or slightly less drug as a way of roughly estimating the ESC/ECC of the resulting progeny.</p>
<p>A minor limitation of this protocol is that the resulting transgenic flies may not be physically distinct from wild type animals as drug-based selection/counterselection does not rely on physical markers, requiring molecular analysis to confirm successful transgenesis. This can be remedied by the addition of a physical marker into the design of a selection marker containing transgenic construct for simple, visual confirmation of accurate drug selection/counterselection (<a href="#bib1">Kandul et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib2">Matinyan et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib3">Steller and Pirrotta, 1985</a>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that adult flies remain relatively unaffected by drug treatment (<a href="#bib2">Matinyan et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib3">Steller and Pirrotta, 1985</a>). Though this is helpful in terms of allowing non-resistant animals to survive on and lay eggs in drugged food, it does limit drug-based selection/counterselection to developing larvae. However, for tractable genetic manipulations, selection or counterselection is ideal during larval development, removing all unwanted genotypes from the eclosing progeny.</p>
<p>Finally, drug exposure does slow down larval development (<a href="#bib2">Matinyan et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib3">Steller and Pirrotta, 1985</a>). Larval development is retarded by about a week on drugged food versus vehicle control at 25°C. The slowdown occurs regardless of genetic background or marker expression. However, the additional time is more than balanced by time saved by not having to screen progeny daily as they eclose. Moreover, once the desired transgenic is generated, animals no longer need to be raised on drugged food. We have not observed any differences in developmental timing or health between wild type and drug marker expressing fly stocks, when raised on regular food.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Difficulty in dispensing precise amount of food per vial (see step 14)</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>While a reasonably cheap food dispensing tool to fill an entire flat of one hundred vials at once is commercially available, known as the Droso-filler, we recommend against using it. Although this tool allows for quick dispensing of food, we find that the resulting volume of food in the vials to be highly variable between vials in the same tray, and from tray to tray. Accurate drugging of the food requires precise dispensing of food into each vial to reduce variability between replicates and ensure accurate results. While the most high-tech solution would be the use of a calibrated, piston-driven pump, there are a number of alternatives to precise dispension that we mention in this protocol. Though time consuming, individually measuring out food into each vial and comparing to a reference vial with known amount inside is necessary if no other alternative is available. Though we have not tried it ourselves, it is likely that a catheter tip syringe, with the tip cut to increase the size of the intake, may allow for precise food dispensing as well.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Low number of recovered animals but high number of pupal cases (see step 30)</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>On occasion, due to high ambient humidity or food quality, a low number of adults flies will be recovered from a vial despite a high number of empty pupal cases on the sides of the vial. In such cases it is likely that many of the adults have fallen into food, making an accurate count of surviving animals difficult. A solution is to instead count the empty pupal cases as a substitute for actual adult flies. The difference between empty and full pupae can be easily seen if the vial is placed in front of a light source as empty pupal cases will be transparent.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>High variability between replicates per concentration (see step 31)</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We recommend always using younger animals for determining effective selection or counterselection concentrations as older animals produce fewer offspring which may introduce high variability when counting surviving flies at the end of the experiment. If running the experiment at 25°C we also recommend acclimating the flies to the elevated temperature by placing them into the incubator 1–2 days prior to setting up the crosses. Increasing the number of vials per concentration or the number of flies per vial is another potential solution though the resulting experiments will require greater numbers of animals.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Two or fewer fertile replicate crosses for one or more drug concentrations (see <a href="#quantification-and-statistical-analysis">quantification and statistical analysis</a>)</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Though unlikely if using flies 3 weeks or younger and acclimated to experimental conditions, on occasion a titration curve may yield only two fertile crosses for a particular drug concentration for a given strain. We always recommend having at least 3 replicates per drug concentration per strain for robust statistical analysis of the results. If the affected concentration is at or near the suspected effective selection/counterselection concentration (ESC/ECC), we recommend redoing the whole titration curve to ensure an accurate result. However, if the ESC/ECC can be determined without including this concentration point, it may not be necessary to repeat the experiment.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Significant difference in resistant (selection) or wild-type (counterselection) survival at the putative ESC/ECC versus vehicle control (see <a href="#quantification-and-statistical-analysis">quantification and statistical analysis</a>)</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It may be possible that after statistical analysis of a user’s survival curve, that at the drug concentration where all non-resistant animals (if determining an effective selection concentration) or where all sensitized animals (if determining an effective counterselection concentration) are totally non-viable, there is a significant difference in the survival of either the drug resistant or wild-type strain versus vehicle control. In this case, it is likely that the true ESC/ECC lies in between this point and the preceding one. Determination of the true ESC/ECC will require a second, smaller drug titration curve focusing on concentrations inbetween these two points. We recommend performing this second, finer drug titration curve.</p>
