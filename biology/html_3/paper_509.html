<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The accumulation of proteins into insoluble aggregates is a common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases. Aggregated α-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies that pathologically define Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we present methods for the detection of pathogenic conformations of α-synuclein in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) patient-derived neuron models and brain tissue. These methods can be applied to studies of PD pathogenesis and the discovery of novel therapeutics that restore physiological α-synuclein.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib1">Cuddy et al. (2019)</a> and <a href="#bib15">Zunke et al. (2018)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec2.2">Equipment</h3>
<ol>
<li>A motor-driven homogenization apparatus is recommended for the initial extraction steps. We use a Glas-Col model 099C K54 that can achieve up to 4,000 rpm, with a Teflon pestle and conical glass vessel such as DWK Life Sciences #K885480-0020.</li>
<li>To help solubilize detergent insoluble α-synuclein aggregates, we recommend an indirect sonication apparatus using a cup horn submerged in a temperature-controlled water bath. A relatively powerful cup horn is required for this step similar to what is used for DNA fragmentation assays, such as the Qsonica system Q800R3 or similar system. Note that a direct probe sonication method can also be used, although it requires a more careful technique (equal pulse time, probe placement in middle of liquid sample, temperature control, limitation of frothing) to limit extraction variability between samples.</li>
<li>For the gel filtration step, a liquid chromatography (LC) system is required that can achieve at least 50 bar constant pressure. We use an Agilent 1260 Infinity system with a quaternary pump, thermo-cooled autoinjector, diode array detector, and thermo-cooled fraction collector. With this system, we use a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 Increase column from Cytiva (formerly GE Healthcare; formerly Pharmacia). Other LC systems can be used that are capable of achieving the same parameters.
<ol type="a">
<li>Another option for gel filtration is to use a TOSOH SuperSW 3000 column with a TSK gel. This contains 4 μm resin in a 4.6 mm ID × 30 cm long stainless-steel-encased column that can withstand &gt;120 bar of pressure. The SuperSW3000 column can be used when sample is limited. For example, results can be achieved when only 50 μg of total lysate is injected on the column. However, the fractions should be concentrated to &lt;100 μL and analyzed by an ELISA method, since there will be insufficient protein for western blot detection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For immunofluorescence analysis of α-synuclein puncta, we use a Leica TCS SPE CTR4000/DMI4000B confocal microscope with laser excitation. Confocal microscopy facilitates imaging of iPSC-derived neurons since they often culture in clumps, making single focal plane analysis difficult.</li>
<li>For imaging thioflavin S aggregates, a microscope with either a laser excitation at 405 nm or an excitation filter that can achieve 400–440 nm is optimal, such as an Olympus BP400-440 (wide band, cube U-MWBV) or BP420-440 (narrow band, cube U-MNBV) exciter filter, with BA475 barrier filter. Although not optimal, thioflavin S can also be detected on a more common filter capable of detecting GFP or FITC, but only if the bandwidth is wide enough to cover an excitation range of 450 nm and below such as Olympus filter BP420-480, cube U-MSWB. This cube has a wide bandwidth ranging from 420–480 nm. For simultaneous imaging with α-synuclein, using immunofluorescent secondary antibodies that emit red visible color (e.g., Alexa Fluor 568) is required to prevent signal crossover. This can be excited with a 561 nm laser line, or exciter filters (Olympus BP510-550, cube U-MWG; or BP530-550, cube U-MNG). Note that a barrier filter on the Olympus cube will be required to prevent crossover (e.g., BA475 for U-MWBV or U-MNBV, or BA515 for U-MSWB). Far-red fluorophores such as Alexa Fluor 647 will also work, as their emission-excitation spectrum is even farther away from thioflavin S. DAPI or Hoechst fluorescence for nuclear visualization is very close to Thioflavin S, but could be excited using an Olympus BP360-370 narrow band exciter filter with barrier filter BA420 (Olympus cube U-MNU). Note that BP360-370 may partially excite thioflavin S but not to the same extent as DAPI, and therefore crossover is usually not an issue. However, this depends on the abundance of aggregates in the sample. The user should optimize the settings prior to performing an experiment, as microscopy equipment varies greatly between laboratories. Performing the proper positive and negative controls (discussed below) will help to determine optimal settings.</li>

<h2 id="step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</h2>
<h3 id="sec3.1">Sequential protein extraction of α-synuclein from harvested cells or tissues</h3>
<p>To model PD, we generate midbrain dopaminergic neurons from PD patient-derived iPSCs using a well-established differentiation protocol that is initiated by dual SMAD inhibition (<a href="#bib5">Kriks et al., 2011</a>). The concepts of midbrain and other types of neural differentiation, as well as other technical considerations of culture modeling, have been discussed in detail previously (<a href="#bib14">Zunke and Mazzulli, 2019</a>). To obtain suitable starting material from iPSC-derived neurons, we typically plate 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well in a 24-well plate. If more material is needed, plate 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well in a 12-well plate or 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well in a 6-well plate. For brain tissue, we recommend using at least 10 mg per sample. Our culture studies have focused on the analysis of familial forms of PD, such as patients that express the <i>SNCA</i> triplication or A53T α-synuclein, or Gaucher disease patients with <i>GBA1</i> mutations. These lines will often accumulate detectable levels of α-synuclein pathology between 60-to-90 days post-differentiation. However, extending the culture to 120 days may facilitate detection of insoluble α-synuclein, since it allows aggregates more time to grow and mature into stable structures. It is important to characterize the neuron viability of the line to be analyzed, so that these biochemical assays can be performed prior to the onset of neurotoxicity.</p>
<p>Soluble and insoluble α-synuclein protein is sequentially extracted from cells and frozen tissues using extraction buffers containing detergents of increasing strength to differentiate the physiological conformations from pathogenic forms. Under physiological conditions, α-synuclein is primarily extracted in mild, non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100, therefore it is necessary to use an extraction buffer that will effectively disrupt the cell membrane while keeping the integrity of the soluble protein structure intact. We recommend using an extraction buffer containing 1% vol/vol Triton X-100. Since neurons are relatively fragile, using a gentle method of extraction such as homogenization is recommended for this step. For extraction of insoluble α-synuclein, a harsher detergent, such as the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and a vigorous method of extraction such as ultrasonication is recommended.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2–3 days</div>
<p>High and low molecular weight conformers of α-synuclein can be separated and reliably detected via gel filtration followed by western blot analysis. The Triton-soluble fraction is most often analyzed by this method, since it can separate monomers from soluble oligomeric intermediates that are en route to forming higher order, insoluble polymers. However, SDS fractions can be used for this process if desired. There are other methods capable of separating monomers from oligomers such as native gel electrophoresis using Coomassie brilliant blue in the sample buffer to help resolve protein bands (native blue gels). However, this method does not have the same sensitivity at detecting oligomeric intermediates as compared to gel filtration. Optimal sensitivity is critical since in some models, intermediates can be in low abundance and difficult to detect. The gel filtration/western blot method described here can be used with any antibody that is suitable for western blot analysis. This is because after separation, the gel filtration fractions are then boiled in SDS and analyzed by PAGE. This exposes the epitopes efficiently so that the antibody of choice will have a greater capacity to bind to its epitope. This is in contrast to native blue gels where proteins are not denatured, thus leaving some epitopes involved in protein-protein interactions and within the NAC region of self-associated α-synuclein buried and undetectable.</p>

Other antibodies such as syn303 and syn505 can also be used, as they can detect additional α-synuclein cross-linked bands that are associated with pathological inclusions. Blotting for reliable loading controls can then be done to assess both loading, extraction efficiency, and carry over between the fractions. For soluble fractions, we use established soluble proteins such as GAPDH or neuron specific enolase (NSE) as loading controls. For insoluble fractions, we use vimentin. Tubulin can be used as well, however it is normally found in both soluble and insoluble fractions at approximately equal levels. Total protein levels can be used to control for loading, by staining the gel after transfer or by using a total protein stain on the blot prior to the blocking step (see step 42).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Gel filtration/western blots should be sequentially probed as above, followed by either GAPDH, tubulin, or NSE as loading controls and to monitor the column performance. For example, NSE is a known globular dimer under native extraction conditions, and therefore should elute off the column in a fraction that corresponds to ~90 kDa, however will migrate by SDS-PAGE at ~47 kDa. Technical issues during the extraction procedure may result in the breakdown of native structure, which should be evident from the analysis of these control proteins. Total protein levels can be used to control for loading in this step as well, by staining the gel after transfer or by using a total protein stain on the blot prior to the blocking step (see step 42).</div>
<ol start="42">
<li>Analysis:
<ol type="a">
<li>For sequential extraction/western blots, quantify the α-synuclein reactive species and normalize to total protein (from the Coomassie-stained gel) or a reliable loading control as mentioned above. As an alternative to using specific proteins for loading controls, the membrane can be stained with a total protein dye prior to the blocking step such as AzureRed Fluorescent Total Protein Satin from Azure biosystems (SKU: AC2124). The dye can then be imaged by either UV or green light (e.g., using the 520 nm channel of an Azure Sapphire imager). Li-Cor also makes a total protein stain called Revert 700 (Part No. 926-11011) that can be detected on the 700 nm channel, however this may interfere with subsequent antibody detection on this channel. Total protein normalization is often more accurate than using one particular protein, since the protein levels of housekeeping genes may change depending on the experimental conditions. α-Synuclein bands that migrate above 18 kDa monomer may be present, if pathogenic aggregates are cross-linked and stable to SDS and heat. In this case, these bands should be validated to react with other α-synuclein antibodies, and compared to an <i>SNCA</i> knock-out lysate to determine specificity.</li>
<li>For gel filtration/western blots, we determine α-synuclein oligomer-to-monomer ratios. Elevation in the proportion of oligomers normally indicates that pathogenic aggregation has occurred, however this requires further analysis of the oligomeric fraction (<a href="#bib15">Zunke et al., 2018</a>). Additionally, oligomers and monomers can be analyzed separately and normalized to total protein obtained from the Coomassie-stained gel or total protein stain on the membrane. Note that although control proteins such as GAPDH and NSE are analyzed, they should not be used for normalizing α-synuclein levels in particular fractions since they do not elute equally in each fraction.</li>

If a nuclear DAPI stain is used, the excitation, emission, and barrier filters should be set up to limit crossover between the DAPI excitation and Thioflavin S excitation, by using a narrow band filter for the DAPI channel (e.g., Olympus BP360-370, between 360 nm and 370 nm, Olympus cube U-MNU). If the bandwidth of the DAPI exciter is wide (e.g., 330–380 nm), it will excite thioflavin S more efficiently on this channel. In this case, DAPI cannot be used simultaneously with thioflavin S, and an alternative mounting media without DAPI can be used (Southern Biotech Cat # 0100-01).

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>In this protocol, we describe biochemical and immunocytological staining methods for detection of pathological forms of α-synuclein within models of Parkinson’s disease and related synucleinopathies. Most of the procedures described here can also be applied to frozen brain tissue from human or mouse models. Our recently published work demonstrates how these techniques can be applied to determine mechanisms of aggregation and discovery of novel therapeutic pathways (<a href="#bib1">Cuddy et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib9">Mazzulli et al., 2016a</a>; <a href="#bib10">Mazzulli et al., 2016b</a>; <a href="#bib15">Zunke et al., 2018</a>). While each individual method we describe here is suitable for detection of pathological forms of α-synuclein, it is best to use a combination of methods to reach conclusive results.</p>
<p>The protocol described here is optimized for detection of α-synuclein in iPSC-derived neurons or brain tissue. Other dividing cell lines may be used, however it should be noted that some rapidly dividing cell lines have a very different metabolic rate compared to post-mitotic neurons. Therefore, even though dramatic levels of α-synuclein can be overexpressed in cell lines such as 293T cells, it can be difficult to detect insoluble aggregates, since aggregates require time to polymerize, mature, and undergo post-aggregation stabilization such as oxidative cross links. If cells are dividing too rapidly, there will be insufficient time for insoluble polymers to form, and instead they will be diluted out during cell division. Therefore, the cell model used to study protein aggregation should be carefully considered. These issues have been discussed in detail in a recent review (<a href="#bib14">Zunke and Mazzulli, 2019</a>).</p>
<p>Sequential protein extraction followed by western blot analysis can distinguish between physiological and pathological forms of α-synuclein. It is important to note that α-synuclein solubility is operationally defined based on decades of work from labs that have previously characterized the biophysical and biochemical properties of pathogenic aggregates. The homogenization step in 1% Triton X-100 buffer will efficiently disrupt cell membranes and subcellular organelles, releasing soluble proteins into solution while larger polymers remain as particulates. The homogenate containing a mix of soluble and insoluble materials may therefore appear turbid. Clarification of the homogenate is done by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × <i>g</i> for 30 min, which previous studies have found is sufficient to pellet pathogenic aggregates of α-synuclein <i>in vivo</i> (<a href="#bib2">Duda et al., 2002</a>) as well as purified synthetic α-synuclein fibrils (<a href="#bib4">Giasson et al., 1999</a>). In addition to pathogenic aggregates, other large physiological polymers will also be present in the pellet fraction. These are most often structural proteins such as the intermediate filament protein vimentin, which can be used as a loading control.</p>
<p>Imaging inclusions in fixed cells is an important method to confirm biochemical assays. This can be achieved by staining for α-synuclein alone, or by co-staining with thioflavin S to detect amyloidogenic aggregates. Expectations for this analysis have been discussed above under step 60. Using a positive control, such as PFF-treated cultures, will help to train the experimenter’s eye for identifying aggregates, as well as to determine the optimal microscopy setup. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows representative examples of α-synuclein/thioflavin S colocalization in cultures that express A53T α-synuclein.</p>
<p>Since α-synuclein is normally a highly soluble protein under physiological conditions, increased detection of α-synuclein in the Triton-insoluble fraction would suggest that the protein is misfolded and aggregated into either amyloid-like fibrils or amorphous structures. Representative examples of soluble and insoluble α-synuclein western blots can be found in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1A</a> of <a href="#bib15">Zunke et al. (2018)</a>. Amyloidogenic inclusions can be confirmed by thioflavin S staining described above, or by immuno-electron microscopy (not described here, but utilized in <a href="#bib15">Zunke et al. (2018)</a>. Gel filtration analysis of soluble lysates can offer further insight into the aggregation state of the protein. Our previous studies indicated that physiological α-synuclein exists in equilibrium as a soluble monomer, as well as a soluble oligomer in human iPSC-derived midbrain neurons (<a href="#bib15">Zunke et al., 2018</a>). An elevation of the oligomer/monomer ratio usually indicates that the protein is forming pathogenic oligomers that are intermediates of amyloid fibrils. For a representative example of a gel filtration analysis of α-synuclein, please see Figure S2 of <a href="#bib15">Zunke et al. (2018)</a>. The oligomeric fraction can be further analyzed by a battery of assays that are described in detail elsewhere (<a href="#bib15">Zunke et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p>For all of the assays described above, we use multiple antibodies against α-synuclein that have been extensively characterized by us and other labs. Using a combination of antibodies that detect certain post-translational modifications associated with disease (e.g., nitration, oxidization, or phosphorylation) and epitopes that span the entire protein sequence can provide a more comprehensive view and insight into the mechanism of aggregation.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>A limitation of the sequential extraction protocol will likely be sensitivity at detecting insoluble, pathogenic α-synuclein in culture models. In brains of some transgenic mouse models that express aggressive α-synuclein mutations (e.g., <a href="#bib3">Giasson et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#bib11">Tsika et al., 2010</a>), it should be relatively easy to detect insoluble α-synuclein if starting with &gt;20 mg of tissue. However, tissue culture models do not accumulate the same levels of insoluble α-synuclein as what is typically found <i>in vivo</i>. This is likely due to the incubation/maturation time and different environment that occurs <i>in vitro</i>. For example, cultures undergo regular media changes which replenishes essential co-factors, vitamins, and other supplements that are found in neural basal/B27 media. Detection of aggregates is even more challenging in dividing cells lines as discussed above and elsewhere (<a href="#bib14">Zunke and Mazzulli, 2019</a>). However, some detection issues can be overcome by simply increasing the starting culture material and using a more sensitive antibody that preferentially detects pathological α-synuclein. It may be required to harvest a confluent 6-well or 10 cm-sized dish, and use a very small volume of SDS extraction buffer to the Triton-insoluble pellet (e.g., 50–100 μL). Loading up to 80 μg per gel lane is possible, if using a 10-well, 1.5 mm thick, tris-glycine system.</p>
<p>For gel filtration analysis, it is important to keep in mind that the protein size is an estimate that is based on the elution profile of protein standards that are all globular with well-defined structures. The size exclusion technique reports on a particular proteins’ adsorption and elution behavior in solution through the gel matrix. Monomers of α-synuclein are not globular in structure (<a href="#bib13">Weinreb et al., 1996</a>) but are an extended, rod-like shape. Therefore, although α-synuclein monomers are predicted to weigh 14,460 Da based on amino acid sequence and mass spectrometry, the extended shape causes it to elute off of a gel filtration column much earlier than expected, at around a MW of a 60 kDa globular protein. Therefore, it is more accurate to report the Stoke’s radius or elution volume instead of the MW, since the latter is an interpretation. In this case, the radius indicates how much space a particle or protein occupies in the gel matrix.</p>
<p>Another issue in gel chromatography of oligomeric species in complex cell lysates is the possibility of protein-protein interactions that may alter the elution profile. It may be necessary to perform further studies to characterize the protein. If α-synuclein extracted from a lysate elutes off of the column very early (e.g., 100 Å), it could be either a self-associated oligomer, or a monomer that is in a large complex with other proteins. We have previously used immuno-FRET assays, or dot-blots using antibodies that selectively bind oligomers, to help distinguish between these possibilities (<a href="#bib15">Zunke et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p>Thioflavin S is a commonly used dye for the detection of amyloidogenic inclusions because of its high binding affinity for the β-pleated sheet contents of proteins. However, one drawback of thioflavin S is that it is not protein specific and will detect any protein with a β-pleated sheet. Therefore, careful colocalization analysis needs to be performed when examining whether a protein has formed amyloidogenic inclusions. As with most fluorescence techniques, a significant limitation to immunofluorescence is sample photobleaching. Thioflavin S is not as robust as some fluorophores such as Alexa dyes, and rapid fading of thioflavin fluorescence intensity may occur. Therefore, using optimal concentrations of the dye, and rapidly imaging the samples may help in preventing signal fade. It should be noted that thioflavin T can also be used for staining cultures, which shifts its excitation maximum from 385 to 450 nm only upon binding to β-pleated sheets, and can be detected at 482 nm (FITC channel) (<a href="#bib7">LeVine, 1999</a>). Most labs use thioflavin S for histology or cell staining, however the reasons for using this dye over thioflavin T are not clear and likely to be for historical reasons.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>In section 1, the Triton-insoluble α-synuclein is not detectable.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Repeat the experiment by increasing the amount of starting material and dissolve the insoluble pellet in a smaller extraction volume to concentrate the sample. Increase the amount of protein loaded per lane. Also, increasing the concentration of the α-synuclein antibody and incubating the blots for several days should increase sensitivity. Some ECL-based reagents may also provide greater sensitivity, but should be used with caution since it is easy to obtain saturated, non-quantifiable signals.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>In section 1 or 3, there is protein carryover within the SDS fraction.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Excessive carry over of soluble α-synuclein into the insoluble pellet can generate misleading results and often occurs from inefficient removal of the supernatant fractions after ultracentrifugation. Carryover is detected by probing insoluble fractions with loading control proteins that are mainly soluble (GAPDH or NSE). Performing at least one pellet wash with Triton-containing extraction buffer is important prior to doing an SDS extraction. If carryover is significant, it may be necessary to wash and spin down the pellet 2–3 times.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>In section 3, there is very poor or no detection of α-synuclein via western blot analysis.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>α-Synuclein tends to easily detach from western blotting membranes. A mild fixation of the membrane with 0.4% PFA is necessary to prevent this detachment. Alternatively, increasing the concentration of the primary antibody or incubating the membranes with the primary for an additional night may be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>In section 4, there is high background when performing thioflavin S immunofluorescence imaging.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Be sure to extensively wash out the thioflavin S after removing it from cells. It is also critical to capture images at the appropriate exposure and to adjust the imaging scaling so that non-specific background signal is eliminated. Some images can appear positive when in fact they have simply been overexposed. Background levels are established by staining <i>SNCA</i> knock-out cells, control cells that do not demonstrate pathology, or disease cells with the thioflavin S dye omitted. In the case of amyloidogenic α-synuclein aggregates, it is required to co-stain the thioflavin signal by colocalization with α-synuclein antibodies and follow the guidelines noted above for identifying aggregates such as size and location within the cell. The addition of negative controls (e.g., <i>SNCA</i> knock-out) and positive controls (cultures where pre-formed fibrils are added) are essential in setting up the technique and training the observer’s eye so that an authentic signal can be identified with confidence.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>In section 4, there is sample bleaching when performing thioflavin S immunofluorescence imaging.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Thioflavin S is not as robust as some fluorophores used in immunofluorescence protocols such as Alexa dyes, and can bleach quickly. Therefore limiting the time of light exposure time is important. Additionally, images should be taken as quickly as possible to avoid loss of fluorescence intensity.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>In section 3, high back pressure in the gel filtration column occurs, or low detection of α-synuclein in fractions.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>High back pressures can be observed if particulates or insoluble materials are accidentally injected in the LC system or get into the column. This occurs more often in older, re-used columns that are not well maintained. It is critical to clean the gel filtration column every 10-to-20 separations with 1 column volume 0.1 M NaOH followed by water, to remove any aggregates that have retained in the column. Aggregates that are stuck in the column will not only increase the back pressure, but also will reduce the amount of α-synuclein that elutes from the column. It is also critical to change the top filter on the bed of the resin as required, usually when the pressure increases by 1–2 bar from its normal baseline value.</p>
