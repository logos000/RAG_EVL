<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Advanced-stage gynecologic cancer remains a life-threatening disease. Here, we present a protocol for establishment of stable <i>in vitro</i> 3D spheroid cells derived from human uterine endometrial and ovarian cancer tissues. The tumor-derived spheroid cells have cancer stem cell-related characteristics, including tumorigenesis, and can be used for biological and biochemical analyses and drug efficacy assays. Because these cells possess the biological characteristics of original human tumors, spheroid cells and spheroid-derived xenografts will have applications in personalized medicine in the future.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Ishiguro et al. (2016)</a> and <a href="#bib6">Mori et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This protocol focuses on tumor-derived spheroids, also known as tumorospheres, under floating culture conditions. As it is well established that normal neural and mammary stem cells can be propagated in sphere cultures (<a href="#bib2">Chakrabarti et al., 2018</a>), spheroid cultivation is, thus, suitable for <i>in vitro</i> cancer stem cell cultivation (<a href="#bib8">Pastrana et al., 2011</a>). As such, tumor-derived spheroids can enrich cancer stem cells or cells with stem cell-related characteristics, a feature distinct from that of other 3D cultivated cancer cells, including patient-derived organoids (<a href="#bib4">Ishiguro et al., 2017</a>). Evidently, spheroid culture is suitable for cancer stem cell-related studies. Additionally, spheroid culture requires relatively simple culture conditions and incurs lower costs compared to organoid culture.</div>
<ol>
<li>Perform all procedures under aseptic conditions in order to avoid exposure to bacteria.</li>
<li>Prepare the reagents in the <a href="#materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</a> section before tumor sample collection.</li>
<li>Cells are cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator.</li>
<li>It is essential to confirm the pathological diagnosis of the tumors and avoid isolating nearby nontumor regions, although a long-term culture of spheroid cells can only be established from uterine endometrial and ovarian malignant tissues and not from uterine endometrial hyperplasia, ovarian low potential malignant tumor, or normal tissue.</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min</div>
<p>Acquisition of good-quality tissue samples is one of the most important steps to establishing spheroid cells. In this step, we describe the points to which attention should be paid in collecting samples.</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect tumor tissue for cell cultivation, and extract DNA or RNA as soon as possible after surgical resection (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).

<p>The images correspond to the indicated procedural step. White scale bar, 1 cm; yellow scale bar, 100 μm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Tumor samples for cultivation are placed on ice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and transported to the laboratory. Samples for DNA or RNA extraction are washed with PBS, cut into small pieces, placed in cryopreserved tubes, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Cancer tissues always contain necrotic tissues. It is important to collect fresh and viable tissue samples for efficient cultivation and further analyses. To obtain high-quality samples, contact well-versed gynecologic oncologists or pathologists.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Because failure of spheroid cultivation can result from insufficient sample size, more than 1 cm<sup>3</sup> sample size, if available, is preferable for cell culture.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.2">Isolation of cancer cells from tissue samples</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 h</div>
<p>In this step, the procedure performed aims to make the collected tissue samples suitable for initial cultivation.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> This procedure should be started immediately after the surgical resection.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> When unable to immediately perform the procedure after the resection, store the sample at 4°C or on ice in DMEM/F12 and penicillin-streptomycin. Over-storage is not recommended, although viable cells can be obtained from tissue samples after 14–17 h storage.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Warm a bioshaker to 37°C.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The bioshaker for cell isolation should be discriminated from that for bacterial cultivation.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Wash the samples with PBS 2 to 3 times for a few seconds.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Uterine endometrial cancer tumor samples are sometimes contaminated with bacteria because of pyometra. In such cases, wash samples intensively with PBS to remove surface fragile tissue and liquid to prevent contamination.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Mechanically cut the tumor into small pieces (approximately ~0.5 cm in size) and mince with a disposable sterile scalpel or razor blade.</li>
<li>Transfer the all tumor to a 50-mL tube and add 10 mL tissue processing buffer, 500 μL collagenase/hyaluronidase (finally 0.5×), 100 μL penicillin/streptomycin (finally 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin), and 200 μL amphotericin B (finally 5.0 μg/mL).</li>
</ol>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> When a large sample can be obtained, the digestion solution should be proportionally increased.</div>
<p>We checked the adequate concentration of collagenase/hyaluronidase to dissociate ovarian and endometrial tumor samples, and similar effects were obtained with collagenase/hyaluronidase concentrations ranging from 0.25× to 1×.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Wrap the tube to prevent bacterial contamination.</li>
<li>Shake the tube in the bioshaker at 37°C at 200 rpm for 60 to 120 min</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> To avoid over dissociation, check the sample conditions at 60, 90, and 120 min after the commencement of shaking. Over dissociation is one of the causes of failure of spheroid cultivation. Therefore, when the over-dissociated sample solution appears more turbid and the tumor volume is decreased to approximately one-third of the initial volume, dissociation should be stopped.</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Sequentially filter the sample through 100-μm and 70-μm cell strainers, rinse the tube with tissue processing buffer, and filter the rinses through the same cell strainer.</li>

<li>Incubate at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified incubator.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Y-27632 can drastically improve the expansion of colon cancer spheroids (<a href="#bib7">Ohata et al., 2012</a>). Like colon cancer spheroid cells, it is important to add Y-27632 (final concentration of 20 μM) and insulin (10 μg/mL) to the cultivation medium for ovarian cancer spheroid cells (<a href="#bib3">Ishiguro et al., 2016</a>). In most cases, Y-27632 and insulin are not required for proliferation and maintenance of endometrial cancer spheroid cells (<a href="#bib6">Mori et al., 2019</a>).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Low cell density (i.e., &lt;1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL) is one of the causes of failure of spheroid cultivation. The appropriate size of culture dishes should be selected to maintain cellular concentration.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.3">Cultivation of spheroid cells</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> at least 1 month</div>
<p>After the above initial cultivation, cells should be carefully cultivated until a continuous spheroid cell growth is achieved. This step describes the important points to be noted for continuous cultivation.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>Tip the dish for 30 s, remove one-third of the volume of the medium, and add an equal volume of fresh medium every 2–3 days. Fresh medium containing Y-27632 and insulin should be used for ovarian cancer cells.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Transfer all cells and medium to a 10-mL tube, centrifuge at 267 × <i>g</i> for 5 min, remove one-third of the medium, and add an equal volume of fresh medium. We recommend step 22 rather than this alternative method to avoid stress to cells.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In most cases, all dissociated cells formed sphere-like structures within the first 1–2 weeks.</div>
<p>In cases where sphere-like structures are not formed within 2 weeks, cells generally cannot form spheroid structures even after extended cultivation.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>When large sphere-like structures are formed, mechanically dissociate them by gently pipetting up and down with a 1-mL pipette tip.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> In most cases, the formation and expansion of spheroids should be carefully observed for 1–3 months to confirm stable cell growth. Cell density should be maintained at approximately 1 × 10<sup>4</sup>–1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cell/mL. Enzymatic dissociation to single cells, which applies significant stress to cells, is not recommended at this initial stage of the spheroid expansion.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.4">Passage of spheroid cells with enzymatic dissociation</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min to 2 h</div>
<p>To maintain the spheroid cells, regular passaging is critical. In this step, the process for passaging the spheroid cells is described.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> When cells achieve continuous growth, test the possibility of passage with enzyme using some of the growing cells. For initial some passages, cells should be diluted at a ratio of 1:2 to 1:3. Verify the established spheroid cell lines when cells stably grow after enzymatic dissociation multiple times. Once cultivation is stable, change the medium every 2–3 days described as above (step 22) and passage the spheroid cells every 10–14 days. The dilution rate (1:2 to 1:5) is selected according to the cell condition.</div>
<ol start="24">
<li>Collect cells in 15 mL tube, centrifuge at 267 × <i>g</i> for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.</li>
<li>Add adequate dissociation reagent solution (approximately 1 mL per 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>–1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Because conditions required for cellular dissociation are different among spheroid cells, dissociation conditions (we use Accumax (Innovative cell technologies) and Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and only pipetting) should be determined for each spheroid at the initial passage. Accumax and Accutase are the most efficient reagents we have tried for our endometrial and ovarian cancer spheroid cells.</div>
<ol start="26">
<li>Pipette cells up and down 10–20 times with a 200-μL tip and incubate at 37°C for 5–10 min. Repeat this procedure until the cells are mostly dissociated.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> When the cell aliquot is over 200 μL, a 1000-μL or 5-mL pipette combined with a 200-μL tip is useful.</div>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Density gradient centrifugation (steps 10–18) is useful to remove non-viable cells after dissociation.</div>
<ol start="27">
<li>Add 3–5 volumes of PBS, centrifuge at 267 × <i>g</i> for 10 min, discard the supernatant, resuspend with new spheroid culture medium, and seed in a new cultivation dish (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).

<p>Established spheroid cells can be propagated <i>in vitro</i> for over 1 year with continuous passaging. To avoid changes of spheroid cell characteristics due to long-term cultivation, it is important to store cells at early-passage stages after establishment to monitor any morphological alterations and count passage numbers. It is imperative to not use the same cells for more than 6 months, that is, more than 20 passages. The growth rate of spheroid cells varies, and the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) is useful for determining cell growth quantitively <i>in vitro</i>.</p>
<p>Tumor-derived spheroid cells have cancer stem cell-related characteristics, including tumorigenesis (<a href="#bib4">Ishiguro et al., 2017</a>). After injecting the cells into immunodeficient mice, these cells can generate xenograft tumors, which are pathologically similar to the original clinical tumor. The growth rate of xenograft tumors <i>in vivo</i> is more varied than cell growth <i>in vitro</i>. Some spheroid cell lines can generate xenograft tumors over 6 months after injection. From about 3 to 7 days <i>in vitro</i> cultivation after passage, small-sized spheroid cells can generate xenograft tumors more rapidly than single cells after dissociation.</p>
<p>The established spheroid cells are used for various <i>in vitro</i> assays. Genomic DNA is extracted from spheroid cells and spheroid-derived xenograft tumors, as from the original clinical tumor for sequencing. Examination of cancer-related genes in spheroid cells, spheroid-derived xenograft tumors, and original clinical tumor cells indicate that these cells share similar mutation profiles. See Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 in our original report (<a href="#bib6">Mori et al., 2019</a>). In addition, RNA is extracted from the spheroids for microarray analysis, quantitative real-time PCR analyses, RNA-seq, and protein is extracted for Western blotting analyses. Moreover, the cells can be subjected to cell sorting using FACSAria II and III Cell Sorter (BD Bioscience) after staining of cell surface markers or ALDEFLUOR reagent (STEMCELL Technologies). See Figure 2 in our original report about ovarian cancer (<a href="#bib3">Ishiguro et al., 2016</a>) and Figures 1 and 6 in our original report about uterine endometrial cancer (<a href="#bib6">Mori et al., 2019</a>). Metabolic states of the cells are measured by using Seahorse XFe-24 extracellular flux analyzer (Agilent). See Figure 6 in our original report (<a href="#bib6">Mori et al., 2019</a>). The spheroid cells are also suitable for other applications, including examination of chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity assays using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). For the <i>in vitro</i> cell growth assays, cell samples should be extensively dissociated to single cells to measure accurate cell numbers.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The limitation of our protocol is a moderate success rate of establishment of spheroid cells (approximately 30%–40%). Tumor samples from high-grade tumors and advanced-stage disease cases tend to be capable of generating spheroid cells more easily than low-grade and early-stage disease cases. Hence, the spheroid experiments may be more suitable for examining advanced high-grade tumors, which is in contrast to an organoid culture that, in general, allows the cultivation of various stages of tumors (<a href="#bib1">Boretto et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib5">Maenhoudt et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Decreased cell viability and cell loss</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>For the purpose of passaging, complete dissociation to single cells is not recommended because the over-dissociation procedure causes decreased cell viability and cell loss. Additional Y-27632 (20 μM) in the dissociation reagent solution has a positive effect on the viability of some ovarian cancer spheroids. During dissociation by pipetting, the pipette tip should not be held directly against the tube or dish to avoid unnecessary mechanical stress to cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Contamination of non-cancer cells</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>During initial cultivation, non-cancer cells, especially macrophages, attach to the dish soon after cultivation. Collection of the unattached cells and multiple changes of the dish can facilitate the removal of the macrophages. Other non-cancer cells, especially fibroblasts, cannot propagate in the spheroid medium because they require a serum-containing medium. As a result, established spheroids over-propagate these non-cancer cells. Staining with an epithelial cell marker is useful to determine the purity of cancer cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Cell loss during preparation of spheroid cell block</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Small amounts of spheroid cells cause failure in the preparation of spheroid cell block. When it is difficult to embed the small cell pellet into a paraffin block, embed spheroids into iPGell (GenoStaff, Tokyo, Japan) before PFA-fixation, according to the manufacturer’s instruction.</p>
