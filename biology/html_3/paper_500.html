<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) phospholipids induces necrotic cell death through compromised cell membrane integrity during ferroptosis. We established assays to investigate oxidoreductase-mediated oxidative rupture, specifically via NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R1), of PUFA phospholipids in artificially generated protein-free liposomes. Liposome breakage was detected via Tb<sup>3+</sup> liposome release and electron microscopy liposome morphology imaging. This protocol was also applied to other oxidoreductases with analogous functions and investigation of ferroptotic membrane damage in cell-free systems.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib1">Yan et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>The protocol below describes a method for detecting lipid peroxidation induced liposome damage by oxidoreductases POR and CYB5R1; mediated through a series of redox reactions. Moreover, this method is applicable to liposome damage by other triggers, such as pore-forming mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL) proteins (<a href="#bib2">Wang et al., 2014</a>) and gasdermin proteins ( <a href="#bib3">Ding et al., 2016</a>) induced membrane leakage without any chemical reactions.</p>

<li>Generate recombinant vectors for the expression of oxidoreductases POR and CYB5R1 in the bacterium pET28c vector. Delete the transmembrane domains of POR (aa 2–42) and CYB5R1 (aa 2–28) to facilitate purification. The vectors are termed hereafter as pET28a-Δ2-42 POR and pET28a-Δ2-28 CYB5R1. Generate specific point mutations of POR variants (Y178D; A284P; R454H; V489E; C566Y; V605F) by site-directed mutagenesis. All vectors are available upon request from <a href="#bib1">Yan et al.

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min</div>
<p>This section describes how to prepare liposome which do not enclose Tb<sup>3+</sup> ions. These liposome was used as a substrate for POR mediated lipid peroxidation and the damage was detected by electron microscopy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dissolve the soy phospholipid mixture and bovine cardiolipins from heart in chloroform (10 mg/mL stock solution) under nitrogen and store them at −20°C. Add 80 μL of soy phospholipids and 20 μL bovine cardiolipins into 500 μL of chloroform in a round-bottomed flask (10 mL).</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The lipid should be carefully covered with nitrogen to protect from oxygen. Even a small amount of oxygen would cause oxidative damage to the lipids with time.</div>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Argon could also be used to protect phospholipids from oxygen.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> As this protocol is used for testing lipid peroxidation of PUFA phospholipids mediated membrane damage, it is critical to make sure PUFA phospholipids are included in the lipid mixtures. In this protocol, PUFA phospholipids were included in the soy phospholipid mixture and bovine cardiolipins. However, when using other phospholipids for example PUFA contained phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine are all optional. According to our previous research, when approximately 2% of membrane lipids are oxidatively damaged, the liposome membrane becomes permeabilized. Therefore, at least 2% of PUFA phospholipids should be incorporated into the liposomes. The higher the concentration of PUFA phospholipids, the more easily lipid peroxidation-mediated membrane damage occurred.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Evaporate the chloroform using a vacuum rotary evaporator (BUCHI) using gentle and continuous rotation (150 rpm) under a water bath at 30°C to form an evenly spaced phospholipid film.</li>

<li>The hydrated phospholipid was draw via syringe and subjected to extrusion through a polycarbonate membrane (100 nm) 30 times using a mini-extruder (Avanti) to generate morphologically uniform liposomes.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The extrusion process must be slow and gentle, with an approximate speed of 100 μL per second.</div>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>This section describes how to perform the POR and CYB5R1 catalyzed redox reactions on liposomes encapsulating Tb<sup>3+</sup>.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Dilute liposomes encapsulating Tb<sup>3+</sup> (100 μg/mL), oxidoreductase (100 nM), ferric chloride (120 μM), and DPA (50 μM) into 100 μL of buffer L. Pass oxygen (3 L/min) into the mixture via a thin needle for 10 s. Add nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (50 μM) into the mixture to initiate the reaction.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In the negative control groups, no oxidoreductase, NADPH, or ferric chloride were added. In some groups, WT or mutant POR proteins were included. When analyzing the additive effect of POR and CYB5R1, 100 nM each of the protein was added. In some groups, Fer-1 (1 μM) or Lip-1 (1 μM) were added.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> NADPH is an electron donor for POR, and NADH is an electron donor for CYB5R1. When analyzing the additive effect of POR and CYB5R1, both electron donors were included in the mixtures.</div>
<ol start="16">
<li>As soon as NADPH and/or NADH was added, the fluorescence signal (λ<sub>ex</sub>= 270/λ<sub>em</sub>=620 nm) was measured via microplate reader as Ft <sub>0</sub>. Then, the fluorescence signals were recorded at 20 s intervals for about 120 times (about 40 min), after which 1 μL of Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v) was added to the liposomes to completely release the Tb<sup>3+</sup> ions. The fluorescence signal value achieved by Triton X-100 was recorded as Ft<sub>100</sub>. At each time point (Ft), the percentage of liposome leakage was defined as: Leakage (t) % = [(Ft-Ft<sub>0</sub>) / (Ft<sub>100</sub>-Ft<sub>0</sub>)] × 100.</li>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Previous research (Wang et.al., 2014) used emission wavelength λ<sub>em</sub>=490 nm to detect the fluorescence signal of Tb<sup>3+</sup>/DPA chelates. NADPH has a strong signal under λ<sub>em</sub> 490 nm but is not detected under λ<sub>em</sub> 620 nm. Additionally, λ<sub>em</sub> 620 nm gives a higher signal for Tb<sup>3+</sup>/DPA than λ<sub>em</sub> 490 nm. Therefore we use λ <sub>em</sub> 620 nm in this assay.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>When observed by electron microscopy, liposomes will be a little heterogeneous, with sizes ranging from 50 to 200 nm in diameter. The morphology of liposomes will not always round, and “antenna” like structures are also common. The extent of “antenna” decorating liposomes varies depending on the different lipid compositions. In contrast with the intact liposomes in the control group (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> A left), any liposomes with ruptured membranes (top right in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A right), fragmented morphology (lower left in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A right), or holes (lower right in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A right) were categorized as damaged liposomes. POR, but not POR Y178D mutant, mediated oxidative damage of liposomes will rupture and fragment the liposome membrane. Fer-1 will block the POR mediated oxidative damage of liposomes (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>A and 1B).</p>

<p>When assessed by spectrophotometry, POR/CYB5R1 will induce liposome leakage by increasing Tb<sup>3+</sup>/DPA fluorescence. POR mutants or Fer-1/Lip-1 will block these processes. POR mediated increase of Tb <sup>3+</sup>/DPA fluorescence signal will occur when any PUFA are present (soy phospholipid mixture, bovine cardiolipins, or SAPE). POR will not cause leakage when liposomes are totally comprised from SFA (DPPC) (<a href="#bib1">Yan et al., 2020</a>) ( <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> ).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The proteins used in this protocol are purified from bacterium. It is unclear whether the enzymatic activity of POR/CYB5R1 would be different when they are purified from mammalian cells.</li>
<li>The proteins used in this protocol are deficient in their transmembrane domain. It is unclear whether the transmembrane domain of POR/CYB5R1 would affect their function in these <i>in vitro</i> assays.</li>
<li>Special instruments are required (i.e., PLASMA CLEANER and electron microscope) to observe POR mediated membrane damage.</li>
<li>The pore size formed by POR/CYB5R1 is not assessed. Fluorescent labeled dextran with different molecular weights could be used as an encapsulated substrate to reflect pore size during oxidative membrane damage.</li>
<li>The types, ratio, and composition of lipids in this assay may not fully reflect the membrane lipid composition.</li>
<li>The liposomes used in this protocol are membrane protein free. The potential impact of membrane proteins on lipid peroxidation-mediated membrane damage is an unknown.</li>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Enzyme-independent damage of liposomes in the presence of ferric chloride (step 1).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>PUFA phospholipids are easily oxidized when exposed to oxygen, and oxidative damage in phospholipids can be amplified by iron in a non-enzymatic catalyzed manner. Therefore, phospholipids resolved in chloroform need to be carefully protected from oxygen by inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, to lower the background.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Few liposomes attached into EM grid in the POR-free group (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Proteins in the reaction mixture facilitate the attachment of liposome to EM grid. In the blank control group where no POR protein is added, glycerol (1% v/v) or similar concentration of BSA (100 nM) can be added to increase the binding between the liposome and EM grid.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Insoluble of phospholipids during extrusion process (step 13).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Higher concentrations of phospholipids are not easy to fully solubilize. In particular, when only SFA DPPC is included it is extremely difficult to maintain solubility during extrusion. Pre-warming of the mini-extruder on a 65°C blocker greatly facilitates the solubility of DPPC. Moreover, lowering the concentration of DPPC (less than 2 mg/mL) facilitates the extrusion process.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>High fluorescence background in the spectrophotometry assay (step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Only a portion of the Tb<sup>3+</sup> ions are encapsulated into liposomes during the extrusion processes, a great deal of Tb<sup>3+</sup> ions remain outside of liposomes. It is important to ensure the external Tb<sup>3+</sup> ions are absolutely washed out. Regularly checking for Tb<sup>3+</sup> ions in the flowthrough fraction in the 100 KD cut-off concentrate tube by adding DPA is important. Ideally, the fluorescent signal of the flowthrough fraction is close to the value of buffer L plus DPA, indicating a low contamination of external Tb <sup>3+</sup>.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>High fluorescence background caused by NADPH (step 16).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>NADPH, or other components in your assay system, might give a high fluorescence background. Reducing the concentrations of contaminated fluorescence materials would decrease the background but sometimes this can cause inefficient enzymatic reactions. Another method is to re-scan the excitation and emission wavelength spectrum of the contaminated fluorescence material and the target, to achieve an optimal excitation and emission wavelength for the assay. A combination of these two methods is also viable.</p>
