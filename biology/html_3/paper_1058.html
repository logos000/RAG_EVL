<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Ectopic/overexpression systems are important for studying protein function, but care must be taken to avoid artifacts due to excessively high levels of overexpression. To study the function of YAP/TAZ in YAP/TAZ-deficient (YAP<sup>off</sup>) cancers, we developed a lentiviral system using weak, constitutive promoters to ectopically express YAP/TAZ to physiologically relevant levels. We detail this system along with protocols to assess YAP/TAZ expression by flow cytometry and quantitative western blotting. This system can also be easily adapted for the study of other proteins.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00576-1/sref5">Pearson et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol describes the use of a lentiviral system using weak, constitutive promoters to ectopically express YAP or TAZ (WWTR1) in YAP/TAZ-deficient (herein referred to as “YAP<sup>off</sup>”) cancer cell lines to physiologically relevant levels observed in YAP/TAZ-positive (“YAP<sup>on</sup>”) cancers. We outline the steps to prepare high-titer lentivirus and transduce cells to ectopically express YAP or TAZ along with a GFP reporter (linked through an IRES; e.g., YAP-IRES-GFP) in the YAP<sup>off</sup> NCI-H209 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line using this system. Plasmids expressing wild type YAP, a TEAD-binding mutant (Serine 94 mutated to Alanine; YAP<sup>S94A</sup>) (<a href="#bib7">Zhao et al., 2008</a>) and an overactive YAP mutant (all five LATS Serine phosphorylation sites mutated to Alanine; YAP<sup>5SA</sup>) (<a href="#bib6">Zhao et al., 2007</a>, <a href="#bib8">2010</a>) are described and can be obtained from Addgene. It further details the steps to assess the expression of YAP/TAZ/GFP by flow cytometry and quantitative western blotting to ensure expression to physiologically-relevant levels.</p>
<p>We have applied these same protocols to express YAP/TAZ in many other YAP<sup>off</sup> cell lines, although not all lines are appropriate for flow cytometry due to their clumpy growth characteristics. We used a modified pLKO.1-puro vector backbone driving YAP-IRES-GFP expression from an EF-1 alpha short promoter (EFSp) in NCI-H209 cells, as well as other SCLC and neuroendocrine cells, while a similar set of plasmids using the original phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGKp-GFP) is also available and was used in retinoblastoma cell lines. TAZ is expressed using the PGKp-GFP vector. We have also used these plasmids to express other genes by first digesting the YAP plasmid with EcoRI+BamHI restriction enzymes to remove the YAP cDNA and then cloning in a different expression construct.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> This protocol makes use of a 2<sup>nd</sup> generation lentiviral system. Although they are engineered to be replication defective, these agents pose a potential risk of infection through accidental injection or contact with mucous membranes. Use of these agents should have biosafety approval according to institutional guidelines and appropriate biosafety level 2 procedures should be followed.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparing plasmids</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 days for plasmid preps, variable time to obtain the plasmids</div>
<ol>
<li>Obtain the psPax2 and pMD2.G lentiviral packaging plasmids and the YAP/TAZ transfer plasmids described here from Addgene (see <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a>).</li>
<li>Prepare sufficient quantities of each plasmid. We recommend the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit from Qiagen according to the <a href="https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/plasmid-dna/endofree-plasmid-kits/?catno=12362">manufacturer’s protocol</a>, although other plasmid purification kits should also be appropriate. Resuspend the plasmid DNA in sterile TE buffer at a concentration of 0.5–1.0 μg/μL.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The pLKO-based YAP and TAZ plasmids should be propagated using a recombination-deficient <i>E. coli</i> strain, such as NEB Stable. We also recommend growing the <i>E. coli</i> in Terrific Broth, as opposed to LB media, for higher plasmid yields.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Culturing Lenti-X 293T lentiviral packaging cells</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> About 1 week</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Lenti-X 293T virus packaging cells are cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and are maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Always allow media to warm to at least 20°C–25°C prior to use.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Lenti-X 293T cells are weakly adherent, so it is important to gently dispense media/buffer onto cell monolayers.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Culturing NCI-H209 (YAP<sup>off</sup>) cells for viral transduction</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> At least 1 week</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>YAP<sup>off</sup> NCI-H209 SCLC cells are grown in RPMI-1640 with 7.5% FBS and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. NCI-H209 cells grow as floating clusters of cells and can be harvested by pipetting the cells from the tissue culture flask or dish.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If substantial numbers of dead cells are observed in the culture, you can perform a simple clean-up to remove most dead cells. Gently (ensuring not to break up the clusters) transfer cells to a conical tube, and then place the tube upright in a tissue culture incubator for ∼1hr until the clusters of cells settle to the bottom while single, dead cells stay suspended. Approximately 75% of the media can then be carefully removed ensuring the clusters of cells are not disturbed, and the live cells then passaged. Sometimes cells might be weakly “stuck” to the surface of the culture dish, but these can be easily dislodged by pipetting the culture media against the bottom of the dish 2–3 times.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.4">Culturing control NCI-H661 (YAP<sup>on</sup>) cells</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> Several days to weeks</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>YAP<sup>on</sup> NCI-H661 non-SCLC cells are cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10 mM HEPES and 10% FBS and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5 days to complete with hand-on time of ∼2 h for steps 1–3 and ∼4 h for step 4</div>
<p>This step describes the generation of YAP and TAZ-encoding lentiviruses, including transfection of packaging cells, viral collection, and concentrating the virus by high-speed centrifugation. Typically, 3 × 10 cm plates are transfected for each transfer plasmid (e.g., YAP or TAZ), but this can be increased or decreased if more or less virus is required for a given construct. Alternatively, an individual 15 cm culture dish can be used and is roughly equivalent to 3 × 10 cm plates. Each 10 cm plate will yield ∼10 mL of viral supernatant. The Avanti J-30I high-performance centrifuge with JS-24.38 rotor described here has six buckets, each of which holds ∼30 mL of supernatant, so it is ideal to generate a total of 180 mL (18 plates) of viral supernatant in multiples of 30 mL for each virus. For example, in a single batch you can prepare:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 mL (3 plates) of the EFSp-GFP-Empty virus (control for YAP viruses)</li>
<li>30 mL (3 plates) of the EFSp-GFP-YAP virus</li>
<li>30 mL (3 plates) of the EFSp-GFP-YAP<sup>S94A</sup> virus</li>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5–6 days total, with hands-on time of ∼1 h for steps 5 and 6, and ∼6 h for step 7</div>
<p>This section describes the steps to titrate the lentiviruses generated in previous steps. Here, we describe the procedure using the NCI-H209 SCLC cell line, but we use the same protocol for other YAP<sup>off</sup> cell lines. Titrations do not need to be performed using the exact cell numbers described here, but we recommend keeping the ratio of cell number:media volume consistent with what will be used in subsequent experiments. We also suggest initially titrating viruses separately for each different cell line to be used, as we have observed differences in transduction efficiency of some lines.</p>
<p>Days 1 and 2: Transduce NCI-H209 cells</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Prepare NCI-H209 cells for viral titration. Approximately 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells are required for each different virus plus 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells for a non-transduced (mock) control.
<ol type="a">
<li>Transfer “confluent” NCI-H209 cells (typically at a density of 0.5–1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) to a conical tube and centrifuge at 300 <i>g</i> for 5 min.</li>
<li>Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells back to their original volume in culture media. Pipette the cells vigorously to ensure a single cell suspension.</li>
<li>Count the cells using a hemocytometer (or other means) and dilute to a concentration of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL.</li>
<li>Add Polybrene to a final concentration of 4 μg/mL and transfer 500 μL of cell suspension (2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells) to separate wells of a 24-well tissue culture plate. We recommend starting with six wells per virus, plus one additional well as a non-transduced control. This may be decreased as experience is gained with each vector system.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Transduce H209 cells with lentivirus.
<ol type="a">
<li>Thaw an aliquot of each virus stock and prepare a series of five, 3-fold serial dilutions of each virus into PBS (i.e., 1/3, 1/9, 1/27, 1/81 and 1/243).</li>
<li>Add 2.5 μL from each dilution, as well as undiluted virus, to separate wells of the 24-well plate and incubate 14–18 h.</li>
<li>Collect cells using a P1000 pipette. Pipette up and down 2–3 times to remove any cells loosely attached to the plate and transfer to a sterile microfuge tube.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the cells 5min at 800 <i>g</i>, carefully remove the supernatant and resuspend in 750 μL of media. Transfer the cells to a new 24-well plate and incubate for 3–4 days.</li>

<li>After 3–4 days in culture (4–5 days after viral transduction), stain the cells for GFP expression using flow cytometry (see steps 10–11 below for a detailed protocol) (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A). GFP fluorescence can also be assessed using a fluorescent microscope, although accurately calculating the titer using this method is challenging due to the relatively weak GFP fluorescence and because NCI-H209 cells grow in large clusters.

<p class="chem">- particles/μL = (F × N × D)/V</p>
<p>where: F = the fraction of GFP-positive cellsN = number of cells initially transduced (e.g., 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup>) D = virus dilution factor that produced FV = volume of virus added (e.g., 2.5 μL)</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Using these vectors we have found that YAP/TAZ/GFP expression plateaus 4–5 days after lentiviral transduction in most YAP<sup>off</sup> cell line we have tested, so we typically examine expression at this point. For new cell lines we recommend following GFP expression over time using a fluorescent microscope to determine at which point GFP expression plateaus. Since YAP and TAZ suppress the growth of YAP<sup>off</sup> cells we recommend assessing YAP/TAZ/GFP expression as soon as it plateaus when titrating the virus.</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 6 days total, with hands-on time of ∼2 h</div>
<p>This section describes the steps to transduce NCI-H209 cells for downstream biological assays and molecular analysis. The number of cells initially transduced may vary depending on the downstream assays to be performed and the specific cell line being used, but for most assays we transduce 1–10 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells. Here, we describe the protocol for transduction of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> NCI-H209 cells, which will typically yield ∼5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells five days later. Amounts can be scaled up or down to accommodate specific experiments. We transduce cells so that &gt;90% are YAP/TAZ/GFP-positive, and have found that a MOI of ∼4 is sufficient to achieve this.</p>
<ol start="8">

<li>Collect cells and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge 300 <i>g</i> for 5 min, discard the supernatant and wash cells once in culture media.</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼6 h</div>
<p>This section describes the protocol for examining YAP/TAZ and GFP expression in transduced NCI-H209 cells using flow cytometry. This is a key step in accurately determining the proportion of cells transduced with the YAP/TAZ lentiviruses and in assessing the level of ectopic YAP/TAZ expression, although comparison between different cell lines can be misleading due to differences in instrument settings or background fluorescence of the different cell lines. We use a Beckman Coulter Gallios flow cytometer and Kaluza analysis software, although other flow cytometers capable of multicolor acquisition are also appropriate.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Non-transduced NCI-H209 cells function as an important negative control for both GFP and YAP/TAZ expression since they are negative for both, and the Empty vector cells function as a single-stained (GFP+/YAP-) control.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Steps 5–7: For virus titration, the proportion of transduced cells and GFP expression should increase as the amount of virus is increased, giving a roughly linear response until ∼30% of cells are transduced and then increasing the proportion and fluorescence intensity after that (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A). We typically obtain titers of 0.2–2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> particles/μL when the virus is concentrated 100-fold, with the GFP-Empty vector producing 2–5 fold higher titers compared to the YAP or TAZ viruses (Troubleshooting 5).</p>
<p>Steps 10–11: If the virus was titrated correctly, at least 90% of the YAP-transduced NCI-H209 cells should be GFP and YAP/TAZ-positive 5 days after transduction (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). GFP alone transduced cells (e.g., EFSp-GFP-Empty) should be positive for GFP (&gt;90% of cells), but negative for YAP/TAZ, while non-transduced cells should be negative for both GFP and YAP/TAZ (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B).</p>
<p>Steps 12–15: For western blots, the band for YAP should be visible at ∼75 kDa, whereas TAZ and TUBULIN both run at ∼55 kDa (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Normalized expression of YAP or TAZ should be within approximately 2-fold of the level observed in the NCI-H661 YAP<sup>on</sup> cell line (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Flow cytometry</h3>
<p>The proportion of YAP/TAZ/GFP-positive cells is determined by creating a histogram plot with YAP, TAZ or GFP as the value of the x-axis. A horizontal linear gate/marker is then added to the plot so that the left bound is placed where the non-transduced (mock) histogram ends (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The percentage of cells that fall within this gate as well as their mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) can then be calculated using the analysis software.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Quantitative western blotting</h3>
<p>Band intensities are quantified using the Li-Cor Odyssey software and then YAP or TAZ expression is normalized for protein loading by dividing the YAP/TAZ band intensity by the TUBULIN band intensity. The relative intensity of YAP/TAZ in the transduced YAP<sup>off</sup> cells is then compared relative to the expression in YAP<sup>on</sup> cells (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> and <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>We have used these vector systems successfully in 15 different YAP<sup>off</sup> cell lines and four YAP<sup>on</sup> cell lines. However, we tested two additional YAP<sup>off</sup> cell lines (NCI-H510A SCLC cells, and RB3823 retinoblastoma cells) in which the transduction efficiency and/or promoter activity was too low to drive significant YAP expression. Thus, these vectors may not be suitable for use in all cell lines.</p>
<p>Expression of YAP and TAZ causes cytostasis in YAP<sup>off</sup> cells, and we have observed that some cell lines strongly downregulate the ectopic YAP over a period of 2–3 weeks. This largely precludes using this system to generate stable YAP-expressing YAP<sup>off</sup> cell lines and they must be used for transient, shorter-term assays (&lt;2–3 weeks) in most cell lines.</p>
<p>YAP<sup>off</sup> cell lines often grow in large clumps. For some cells, these are easily dissociated to single cells by centrifugation followed by pipetting (e.g., NCI-H209 cells). However, some lines are much more difficult to dissociate to single cell, and still remain in small clumps of 3–4 cells, which are not suitable for flow cytometry analysis.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>No GFP fluorescence is observed in transfected 293T cells (step 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure plasmids were propagated in recombination-deficient <i>E. coli</i>. Confirm the identity and integrity of the transfer plasmids using restriction digest and DNA sequencing. Repeat future transfections with a different GFP-encoding plasmid to ensure all reagents are functioning properly.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Cells (especially YAP<sup>off</sup> cells) are gradually lost at each centrifugation step during flow cytometry staining (step 11).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure the cells were transferred to a fresh tube (after fixation) for permeabilization. Try increasing the speed of the microfuge by 100–200 <i>g</i> and remove supernatant from the cell pellet using a P1000 pipette (as opposed to aspiration) leaving 30–50 μL of liquid behind. If available, centrifuge the samples in a centrifuge equipped with a swinging bucket rotor. If this does not resolve the problem, start with more cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>High background staining in non-transduced cells during flow cytometry (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>) (step 11).</p>
<figure id="fig4"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1058-Fig4.jpg" alt="Fig4.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 4. Example of α-GFP antibody titration for flow cytometry</div>
<p>Staining of control (non-transduced) or GFP-expressing (PGKp-GFP-Empty) YAP<sup>off</sup> Y79 retinoblastoma cells with the anti-GFP primary antibody at a dilution of 1:200, 1:500 or 1:1000. The same, “no 1°Ab” sample is shown on each plot for reference. Note how the separation between non-transduced and GFP-expressing cells increases as the antibody concentration is reduced.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Try titrating the primary antibody to find a concentration that gives low background and the largest separation between non-transduced and YAP/GFP-transduced cells (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Increase the number of washes after antibody staining can also help reduce background.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>YAP expression is well below or above the expression in YAP<sup>on</sup> cells (steps 11 and 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Increase or decrease the amount of virus used. If this is unsuccessful, using the alternative YAP plasmids (e.g., PGKp <i>vs.</i> EFSp) is another option.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Viral titers are well below expected yields of 0.2–2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> particles/μL when the virus is concentrated 100-fold (Expected Outcomes, steps 5–7).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Collect a small amount of the viral supernatant before and after concentration and titrate these to test whether virus is being lost during the ultracentrifugation step.</p>
<p>If significant amounts of virus are found in the supernatant after concentration, increase centrifugation time. If significant viral titer is “lost” during the centrifugation, ensure that the centrifuge is pre-cooled to 4°C prior to beginning spin, and increase the amount of time for resuspending the virus. For example, after addition of PBS to the viral pellet, the tube can be sealed with Parafilm and incubated on ice with gentle agitation (e.g., on an orbital shaker) for 1–2 h.</p>
<p>If low titers are observed, but this does not appear to be a problem at the concentration step (i.e., the initial viral supernatant has low titers), confirm the identity and integrity of the packaging and transfer plasmids by DNA sequencing and restriction digest. One can also try using fresh Lenti-X packaging cells and confirm that these are free of mycoplasma contamination.</p>
