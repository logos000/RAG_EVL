<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Analyses of microtubule (MT) plus end dynamics at glutamatergic <i>en passant</i> boutons can be carried out in cultured primary neurons isolated from mouse or rat embryos or <i>ex vivo</i> in acute slices isolated from mice that had been electroporated <i>in utero</i>. Here, we describe a protocol for setting up and analyzing live image recordings of primary neurons and acute hippocampal slices expressing tagged versions of the MT plus end binding protein EB3 and the presynaptic vesicle markers vGlut1 or VAMP2.</p>
<p>For complete information on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib4">Qu et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Experimental considerations</h3>
<p>There are two potential starting points: primary neurons or acute slices.</p>
<p>Primary neurons have the following advantages: (1) less laborious; (2) the success rate does not depend on animal survival; (3) faster image acquisition (fewer z-stacks required) to capture all MT nucleation/rescue events; (4) easy for tracking both the proximal and distal portion of the axon; (5) lower chance of interfering with baseline MT dynamics by shorter EB3-EGFP expression. However, the disadvantages are: (1) the circuit is not intact; (2) embryonic neurons; (3) healthy cultures need to be maintained for several weeks <i>in vitro</i>; (4) no correlation with behavioral readouts.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To follow the protocol using primary neurons, follow steps 1–9 in <a href="#before-you-begin">Before you begin</a> and then proceed to 1–7 in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>.</div>
<p>Acute slices have several advantages: (1) spatial compartmentalization is maintained; (2) genetically engineered animals can be used; (3) acute slices are isolated from P21-P28 developed brains in contrast to cultured neurons that are derived from embryos; (4) no high-resolution live-imaging approach is available to perform optical studies in the hippocampus of live animals so acute slices offer a valuable alternative; (5) can be coupled with electrophysiological recordings of specific circuits. The disadvantages are: (1) more laborious and relies on the overexpression of wild-type or mutant genes that are hard to transfect or infect using viral particles <i>ex vivo</i>; (2) the success rate depends on mouse survival from electroporation <i>in utero</i>; (3) not easily adapted for high throughput studies or drug screenings; (4) no correlation with behavioral readouts.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To follow the protocol using acute slices, follow steps 10–28 in <a href="#before-you-begin">Before you begin</a> and then proceed to 8-13 in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Primary rat hippocampal neuronal cultures</h3>
<h4 id="sec1.2.1">Day 1</h4>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min</div>
<ol>
<li>Coat MatTek live-imaging dishes (35 mm Petri dish, 14 mm microwell) with 0.1 mg/mL poly-D-lysine (PDL) in 1× sterile borate buffer for 24–48 h at 37°C. The microwell holds ∼300 μL volume. PDL only needs to cover the microwell.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="sec1.2.8">Day 2</h4>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2–3 h</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Wash microwells 3 times with ddH<sub>2</sub>O.
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause Point:</span> If not seeding cells immediately, cover the microwells with culturing medium. Do not let them dry.</div>
Culture primary hippocampal neurons from E18 rats. Seed 50,000–70,000 cells into microwells of coated MatTek dishes. Spread the cells evenly in the center. After 2 h, add 2 mL of culturing medium.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="sec1.2.2">Days 3–18</h4>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min/medium change</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>To maintain the cultures, change medium every 3–4 days. If starting volume is ∼2 mL, take 300–400 μL out and add 500–600 μL of conditioned medium.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Using conditioned medium collected from dense cultures (100,000 neurons/cm<sup>2</sup>) is critical during the first 2 weeks of culturing. Conditioned medium is composed of growth medium from dense cultures at the same DIV and fresh growth medium at 1:1 volume ratio.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> When adding or removing volumes from the dish, pipette from the side. Do not pipette directly into the microwell.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Healthy neurons will be evenly spread in the imaging chamber with multiple extended and branched dendrites and high spine density (0.5–0.8 spine/μm). This is critical for transfection efficiency and expected EB3 puncta motility (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).

</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> If the neuronal culture does not appear homogenously healthy prior to transfection, trash the cells and do not proceed to the next step. Unhealthy neurons will have short or very few dendritic branches, aggregated neurites, or lift off from the bottom of the well.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Transfection of primary rat hippocampal neurons</h3>
<p>Using this protocol, the transfection efficiency of cultured neurons at 18 DIV is typically no higher than 1% regardless of density of plating, offering the advantage to readily identify single axons even in high density cultures.</p>
<h4 id="sec1.3.2">Day 19</h4>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2.5–3 h</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Hippocampal neurons are transfected at 18 DIV with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. For one dish, mix 0.5–2.5 μg of plasmid DNA with 300 μL of incomplete neurobasal medium (no B27, no glutaMAX, no antibiotics → critical for transfection efficiency). For co-transfection, mix the 2 plasmid DNAs together into incomplete neurobasal medium at this step.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> plasmid DNAs were made from low endotoxin maxiprep kit for example PureLink HiPure Plasmid Filter Maxiprep Kit and were titrated for each batch to make sure cells are expressing the proper level of proteins. Usually for EB3-EGFP (gift from Franck Polleux), use 1.2–1.5 μg /dish; VAMP2-mCherry (gift from Clarissa Waites) or vGlut1-mCherry (gift from Clarissa Waites), 0.5–0.8 μg/dish. EB3 expression should be bright enough to detect comets during live imaging, while having low cytosolic background. Similarly, for VAMP2 or vGlut1 expression, boutons should appear as bright puncta without interfering with the comet signals in the other channel.</div>
</li>
<li>For one dish, add 3 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 to the diluted plasmid DNA-media mix followed by vortexing. Incubate Lipofectamine-DNA mix at 20°C–25°C for 30 min.</li>
<li>Pipette original conditioned medium out from the dishes and save in conical tubes. Add lipofectamine-plasmid DNA mix dropwise to the microwells and make sure the microwells are well covered. Put dishes back into the incubator and the conditioned medium in conical tube in a 37°C water bath.</li>
<li>Incubate for 2 h.</li>
<li>Take dishes out of the incubator and aspirate out transfecting reagents. Tilt the dish so that the liquid is aspirated out completely and the pipette tip does not touch the cells. Add back 2 mL of conditioned medium immediately. Do not let the cells dry.</li>

<p>EB3 comets and vGlut1/VAMP2 puncta can be observed in axons of primary hippocampal neurons in culture and acute hippocampal slices (<a href="#bib4">Qu et al., 2019</a>). In proximal axons (up to 100 μm from the cell body) of cultured hippocampal neurons EB3 comets move distally from the cell body while 72.3% of vGlut1 or 68.6% of VAMP2 puncta are stationary. An EB3 comet can appear in between (arrowhead) or right at (arrow) vGlut1/VAMP2 puncta and move along the axon until it falls off the MT plus end (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> and <a href="#mmc1">Methods Video S1</a> and <a href="#mmc2">S2</a>).</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<ol>
<li>Tiff files can be opened by ImageJ software. To better visualize the comets and reduce background, the average intensity projection image of a time-lapse can be subtracted from each frame. Click Image → stacks → z projects, then choose average intensity. The average intensity projection image of the movie will show up. Click process → image calculator, then subtract the average intensity projection image from every frame of the movie. Save as a tiff file.</li>
<li>Kymographs are generated by drawing a region on the axon from the cell body to the most distal visible end of the neurite. Axons are identified based on morphology and uniform anterograde movement of EB3-labeled MT plus ends. Open the tiff file movie in MetaMorph software to generate kymographs. Draw a line along the neurite from the cell body to the most distal visible end of the axon. Click stack → kymograph. Click measure → calibrate distance to set pixel to μm conversion. Measure only comet tracks moving within 100 μm from the cell body. If doing the analysis in ImageJ, install KymoResliceWide plugin. Click Analyze → set scale to convert px to μm. Draw the line along axons from cell the body to the end of the neurite. Normally axons need 10–15 px wide lines. Click plugin → KymoResliceWide to generate a kymograph. Length of growth can be measured directly on the comet track as X-axis length. Comet lifetime is derived by the measured Y-axis length (Y μm) in the ratio of total kymograph width (D μm), which represents the total length of movie time. For example, in a 180 s movie, comet lifetime (seconds) = 180 × Y/D. Then the growth rate can be calculated by growth length/comet lifetime.</li>
<li>Generate kymographs and distinguish between two groups of MTs, intrabouton and interbouton MTs as illustrated in the Graphical Abstract and in (<a href="#bib4">Qu et al., 2019</a>). Presynaptic MTs are classified based on their plus end contacts with stable vGlut1 or VAMP2 labeled boutons. Intrabouton MTs consist of MTs that nucleate/rescue at, catastrophe at, or pass through stable vGlut1 or VAMP2 labeled boutons. Interbouton MTs are those with no contact with vGlut1 or VAMP2 labeled boutons during the recording. In our measurements of EB3 tracks starting or ending at boutons, we also include those that start or end at a bouton and pass through the next distal or proximal boutons. Kymographs from both channels are overlaid to observe relative location of the comet tracks to stable boutons.</li>
<li>All MT dynamics parameters are defined as in (<a href="#bib1">Qu et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib4">Qu et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib5">Stepanova et al., 2010</a>) and calculated separately for intrabouton MTs and interbouton MTs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Parameters describing MT dynamics are defined as follows:</p>
<table id="undtbl3">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>MT dynamics parameter</th>
<th>Definition</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Rescue/nucleation frequency</td>
<td>number of rescue or nucleation events per μm<sup>2</sup> per min</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<ol start="5">
<li>Import data to GraphPad Prism and plot. If there are less than 15 axons per group or the dataset does not pass normality test, non-parametric tests will be used. Parametric/non-parametric T tests or two-way ANOVA are applied based on number of axons for all parameters. Averages of growth length, comet lifetime, and growth rate are calculated for each axon and statistical analysis is performed on those averages.</li>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The limitations of using primary neuronal cultures are predominantly associated with the challenge of maintaining healthy cultures for several weeks <i>in vitro</i> prior to transfection and the restrictions imposed by the embryonic nature of the cultures and loss of an intact circuit upon dissociation. The acute hippocampal slice approach is more laborious, and hence not well suited for drug screening or high throughput studies, and its success rate greatly depends on mouse survival from <i>in utero</i> electroporation.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Very few EB3 comets per axon or EB3 puncta do not appear to move in transfected neurons (steps 1–3).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This problem is typically caused by poor neuronal health after transfection or during live imaging. Be careful when changing to conditioned media and avoid creating shear stress on the neurons while pipetting. Plasmid DNA should be prepared using endotoxin-free maxi prep kits. Live imaging should always be performed in controlled and steady atmospheric conditions at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and over 90% humidity.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>It is hard to visualize EB3 comets in the <i>in utero</i> electroporated acute brain slice if not used immediately after slicing (steps 5–7).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The duration between preparing the brain slices and live imaging should be kept at minimum. After cutting the slices, they should be immediately transferred into steady atmospheric conditions at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. These conditions must be maintained steady during the entire live-imaging session.</p>
