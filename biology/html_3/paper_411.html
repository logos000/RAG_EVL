<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Cardiac exophers are membrane-bound extracellular vesicles released by cardiomyocytes with varied content and an average diameter of 3.5 μm. Here, we provide a detailed protocol to enable the identification and purification of cardiomyocyte-derived exophers by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting for downstream cellular and molecular analysis. This protocol requires the use of mouse strains expressing fluorescent proteins in cardiomyocytes.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib4">Nicolás-Ávila et al. (2020</a>).</p>

<p>The purpose of this part of the protocol is to identify cardiac exophers in a flow cytometer, in combination with FACS or not, in order to perform downstream analysis on the exophers. The reduced size of these particles demands to increase laser potency and work at slower flow velocities than usual.

</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> a logarithmic view for FSC-A and SSC-A instead of Linear will be useful to discriminate cardiac exophers in this plot. Also, you can use clean sorting buffer to identify the “noise” threshold and avoid contamination from buffer. However, exophers are much larger than any particle coming from sorting buffer (Not shown).</div>
<ol start="32">
<li>Discard doublets by using FSC-H and FSC-W (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A).</li>
<li>Discard particles containing DNA (Draq5+) or endothelial markers (CD31+). This will help “cleaning” the final gate (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A).</li>
<li>Use the fluorescence signal from cardiomyocytes in your fluorescent reporter model to identify cardiac derived exophers from the rest of particles of similar size. Use wild-type or Cre-negative mice as a control to establish the gate (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B). In our case, we induced Tdtomato fluorescent protein expression specifically in cardiomyocytes by crossing mice with a Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse Myh6 promoter (myosin, heavy polypeptide 6, alpha isoform; αMHC<sup>CRE</sup>; <a href="#bib6">Oka et al., 2006</a>) with Rosa26<sup>Tdtom</sup> (<a href="#bib3">Madisen et al., 2010</a>). These mice were referred as Card<sup>RED</sup> in our original publication (<a href="#bib4">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020</a>), although similar results can be obtained with other reporter fluorescent proteins, such as GFP (Not shown). We have used animals from 1 to 50 weeks of age and from both sexes with similar results.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>A successful extraction process should routinely yield 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> or more cardiac exophers from one heart. Good quality cardiac exophers appear roundish and bright under the microscope (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D), and tdTomato signal that can be detected by fluorescent microscopy (<a href="#bib4">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020</a>). These exophers are suitable for flow cytometry, FACS, microscopy, proteomics or metabolic assays (<a href="#bib4">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020</a>). Note: we always use exophers 1–4 h after their isolation. For longer times each researcher must test the integrity of exophers at the needed time.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Due to the lack of knowledge in surface markers specifically expressed on Exophers or Cardiomyocytes by flow cytometry, we rely on mouse strains expressing fluorescent proteins (i.e., tdTomato or EGFP) under cardiomyocyte-restricted Cre lines, such as αMHC-Cre, as this allows identification of those particles after previous enrichment with differential centrifugation steps. By using this protocol in combination with other molecular probes we have described the presence of Mitochondria inside cardiac exophers and phosphatidylserine on their membrane (<a href="#bib4">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020</a>); however, these properties are shared with other extracellular vesicles and cannot be used as unique criteria for their definition. An important consideration is that we use regular FBS in the preparation of our buffers and this may contain exosomes that can influence cultured cell behavior and downstream analysis (<a href="#bib5">Ochieng et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib9">Shelke et al., 2014</a>). If this is important for the user, there are protocols available to deplete exosomes from FBS (<a href="#bib9">Shelke et al., 2014</a>) and specific commercial formats.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Cardiac exophers are less than 1% of the events found in the 1,000 × <i>g</i> pellet obtained in step 23. High SSC/FSC laser voltage, necessary to properly visualize this structures by FACS (steps 30 and 31), may heavily increase the number of events detected by the cytometer (event overflow) causing problems with data acquisition and sorting efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To overcome this problem, there are two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using exopher preparations only for cytometric analysis, an option is to use the sorting buffer to stablish a “noise” threshold in the SSC/FSC channels, so the number of events that the cytometer has to analyze by unit of time is strongly reduced. This helps significantly in terms of acquisition times and posterior data analysis.</li>
<li>In the case of exopher sorting, you may want to avoid debris contamination of your sorted samples. Thus, increase SSC/FSC threshold is not a good option since it will reduce the sorter ability to discard drops containing exophers in combination with undesired elements. In this case, the best option is to dilute samples in a large sorting buffer volume to increase sorting efficiency, in detriment of acquisition time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Rosa26<sup>Tdtom</sup> mice may not be available for some researchers or are not compatible with other fluorophores in the range of tdTomato fluorescence, i.e., phycoerythrin (PE), Keima, etc.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We have successfully used Rosa26<sup>EGFP</sup> in combination with αMHC<sup>CRE</sup> with the same results that those presented for αMHC<sup>CRE</sup> Rosa26<sup>Tdtom</sup>. Any other combination between cardiomyocyte-specific Cre and inducible fluorescent protein expression may work to detect cardiac exophers. If this is your case, you will have to modify the gating strategy and laser used accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Lack of criteria to distinguish between cardiac exophers and other subcellular particles (such as apoptotic bodies) of cardiomyocyte origin in our setup.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To overcome this problem, we have followed a series of steps to minimize the generation of artifacts caused by mechanical rupture of cardiomyocytes. Although these are specified in each respective part of the step-by-step protocol, we summarize them here:</p>
<ul>
<li>After incubation with digestion buffer (step 15), trim the tip to create a larger opening (2 mm is enough) to pass the digested tissue through the strainer. This is important to reduce the applied shear force and to avoid massive rupture of cardiomyocytes.</li>
<li>After transferring the digestion mixture to the strainer (steps 17 and 18), do not force the non-disaggregated pieces of tissue through, just discard them with the filter.</li>
<li>The 50 × <i>g</i> centrifugation in step 21 before the 300 × <i>g</i> centrifugation in step 22 is meant to sediment cardiomyocytes smoothly without causing rupture. Do not skip this step since centrifuging cardiomyocytes at 300 × <i>g</i> will generate a lot of unspecific cardiomyocyte-derived debris.</li>
