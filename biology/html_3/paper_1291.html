<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol describes the differentiation of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) in a microfluidic device containing a thin 3D matrix with two separate chambers, enabling a cleaner separation between axons and soma/bulk neurons. We have used this technique to study how mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) regulate the generation of somal and axonal amyloid β (Aβ) in FAD hNPCs, a cellular model of Alzheimer’s disease. This protocol also details the quantification of Aβ molecules and isolation of pure axons via axotomy.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol provides a detailed workflow to carry out microfluidic isolation of the axons or axonal microenvironments from bulk neurons or somal environments using two-chamber microfluidic devices. We have extensively used human neural progenitor cells overexpressing the FAD-mutant of APP (APP<sub>Swe/Lon</sub>), namely FAD hNPCs, in our studies because 10-day differentiated cells generated high levels of Aβ<sub>40</sub> not only from bulk neurons in the somal compartments, but also from the axons in axonal compartments. Use of microfluidic chamber slides to separate axonal environments from somal to measure axonal and somal Aβ is not unique. Several studies have reported fluidic separation between somal and axonal compartments of microfluidic devices containing differentiated neurons (<a href="#bib6">Niederst et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib2">Das et al., 2016</a>). However, the fluidic separation does not prevent the flow of cells from somal to the axonal compartments, thus contaminating the axonal compartments with bulk neurons. Here, we have introduced a thin-layer 3D matrix in the groove towards the somal compartment of the microfluidic devices to prevent contamination of bulk neurons in axonal compartments. This technique allowed us to more precisely determine axonal Aβ generation in differentiated FAD hNPCs in these microfluidic devices.</p>
<p>The protocol described here utilizes both commercially available as well as in-house two-chamber microfluidic devices. The commercially available (Xona) devices are primarily used to measure the number of Aβ molecules per axon or per cell body upon modulation of axonal MAMs (mitochondria-associated ER membranes) via sigma-1 receptor activation and inactivation. The in-house devices are designed and implemented to physically separate axons by axotomy to perform biochemical analysis to compare MAMs from axons versus soma/bulk neurons. The commercially available Xona devices are not ideal for biochemical assays because the devices are made with materials that are not appropriate for physically severing the axonal side from the somal side for axotomy. On the other hand, the in-house devices are not suitable for Aβ measurement because the somal and the axonal compartments only hold ∼50 μL condition media as opposed to large somal and axonal compartments in Xona microfluidic devices that hold ∼200 μL conditioned media. At least 100 μL axonal conditioned media is required to perform ELISA assays in duplicate for each sample. It is possible to design in-house devices containing large somal and axonal compartments. We are currently engaged in designing such devices.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Validation (24 h)</h3>
<p>There are several experimental factors that need to be perfected before beginning this protocol. Below, we have provided these experimental considerations in detail.</p>
<p>Before measuring somal and axonal Aβ, we first validated that Aβ from the somal compartment did not flow to the axonal compartment in our 3D microfluidic chambers. We also validated that the 3D matrix prepared on the somal side prevented any flow of bulk neurons to the axonal side.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Phase separation of somal and axonal compartments</h3>
<p>To prevent flow of Aβ from the somal compartments to the axonal compartments, in addition to generating a 3D matrix inside the somal groove, we also created a 30 μL phase separation by adding 180 μL media to each somal compartment, and 150 μL media to each axonal compartment (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A). To validate that Aβ did not flow from the somal compartments to the axonal compartments or vice versa, we made two types of chamber slides:</p>

<p>(A) Schematic diagram of a commercial (Xona) microfluidic chamber. The somal groove on the somal compartment is attached with the axonal groove on the axonal compartment by 120 capillaries of 150 μm length. 3D matrix is formed by adding 30 μL Matrigel (1:10) is in the somal groove to allow separation of the environments between the somal and the axonal compartments. In addition, use a phase separation by creating a 30 μL volume difference by adding 180 μL media each on the somal compartments and 150 μL media each on the axonal compartments.</p>
<p>(B) Representative Aβ ELISA assay validating that the phase separation effectively prevented any flow from the somal to the axonal side. Both Slide 1 and Slide 2 are microfluidic chamber slides containing 3D matrix (1:10 Matrigel) in the somal groove. Slide 1 contained 1pM synthetic Aβ<sub>40</sub> only in the somal compartments and no Aβ<sub>40</sub> in the axonal compartments. Slide 2 was created by adding 1 pM Aβ<sub>40</sub> only in the axonal compartments and no Aβ in the somal compartment. After 24 h, Aβ<sub>40</sub> levels were measured in both compartments from Slide 1 and Slide 2. Slide 1 somal compartment retained nearly all Aβ<sub>40</sub>, while Slide 2 retained nearly all Aβ<sub>40</sub> in its axonal compartments. (n=3).</p>
<p>(C) Representative image (20× objective) of GFP-expressing FAD hNPCs (Green fluorescence) seeded in 3D microfluidic chamber slide showing little or no contamination of the axonal compartment with bulk neurons (only 2 out of 30,000). Cells are also labeled with Hoechst (Blue fluorescence) to label nucleus.</p>

<p><i>Slide 1</i>: Here, we prepared a 3D matrix into the grooves on the somal side and added 180 μL media containing 1 μM synthetic Aβ<sub>40</sub> to each somal compartments. We added 150 μL blank media in the axonal compartments.</p>
<p><i>Slide 2</i>: In a separate microfluidic chamber, after making the 3D matrix in the groove on the somal side, we added 180 μL blank media to the somal compartment and 150 μL media containing 1 μM synthetic Aβ<sub>40</sub> to the axonal compartments.</p>
<p>After 24 h, we collected somal and axonal media to measure the Aβ<sub>40</sub> levels in each compartment using Wako Aβ ELISA assay kit based on the standard values (<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>, Raw data of standard, and the slope and intercept values). We measured 918.12±49.96 pM Aβ<sub>40</sub> in the somal compartment and undetectable amounts of Aβ in the axonal compartment from the <i>Slide 1</i> chamber slides (<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> and <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). On the other hand, the somal compartment of the <i>Slide 2</i> chamber slides contained no detectable Aβ<sub>40</sub>, while the axonal compartment contained 929.65±69.10 pM Aβ<sub>40</sub> (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B). This validated that our 3D chamber slides containing a 30 μL volume phase-separation between the somal and the axonal compartments effectively separated somal environment from the axonal environment.</p>

<h3 id="sec4.1">Plating 3D microfluidic chambers to measure somal and axonal Aβ</h3>
<p>In these steps, we have used cell culture and cellular differentiation methods to seed and differentiate FAD hNPCs in microfluidic chamber slides to isolate somal and axonal Aβ. For this, we have used commercially available microfluidic chambers from Xona Microfluidics. We used the microfluidic chambers containing 150 μm capillaries connecting the somal and the axonal compartments. We have seeded FAD hNPCs in 3D into the groove on the somal side prior to differentiating the cells to allow axons extending along the capillaries into the grooves towards the axonal compartments. The method allowed prevention of cells remaining concentrated in the somal compartments without contaminating the axonal compartments with bulk neurons. As an additional step, we created a small volume change between the somal and axonal compartments by adding 180 μL media in each of the somal compartments, while adding 150 μL media in the axonal compartment 24 h before collecting the conditioned media for Aβ analyses.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Change differentiation media every 3 days. For media changes, do not aspirate all media. Leave 20% of the media and replace the rest with fresh media to avoid cell death. For drug treatments, prepare the reagents at a concentration 1.25-fold than the required concentrations.</div>
<h4 id="sec4.1.1">Preparation of somal and axonal Aβ from FAD hNPCs differentiated in 3D microfluidic chambers</h4>
<p>The steps to prepare differentiated FAD hNPCs in microfluidic chambers to separate axons from bulk neurons are as follows:</p>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5 h</div>
<ol>
<li>Precoat the chambers as described in the manufacturer’s (Xona) protocol (<a href="https://xonamicrofluidics.com/protocols/">https://xonamicrofluidics.com/protocols/</a>) as follows (Refer to <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>): [2 h]
<ol type="a">
<li>Pipette 100 μL of precoat (provided by the manufacturer) into the top left well of the microfluidics chamber (facing away from the hole leading to the middle chamber to avoid bubbles) to allow it to flow through the middle chamber.</li>
<li>Wait 1 min then add another 100 μL into the bottom left chamber.</li>
<li>Wait 5 min then repeat steps a and b with the right side of the chamber.</li>
<li>Aspirate off.</li>
<li>Repeat steps a-d 2× only this time instead of using precoat use PBS to wash the chambers.</li>
<li>Repeat steps a and b. This time use Matrigel solution (1:100 Matrigel to DMEM/F12) to coat the chambers.</li>
<li>Incubate the slides at 37°C for 1 h for effective Matrigel-coating of the microfluidic chambers.</li>
<li>Gently aspirate the media using a pipette.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To avoid aspirating off Matrigel, do not use vacuum suction to aspirate.</div>
</li>
<li>If not immediately used, store the Matrigel-coated chambers inside a sealed container at 4°C. The chambers can be stored for maximum 1 month.</li>

<li>Aspirate media off a healthy plate of FAD hNPCs. (Note: we use FAD hNPCs. We plate cells (passage number 12 or less) in expansion media inside T-25 flasks and wait until the confluency reaches to 70%–80%.)</li>
<li>Wash cells with PBS as to remove any unwanted dead cells.</li>
<li>Aspirate off PBS and apply enough accutase to cover all the cells and place in 37°C CO<sub>2</sub> (5%) incubator until cells are fully detached from the plate (around 2–3 min).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> A T-25 flask only requires around 300 μL of accutase to detach cells. If cells stick you can lightly tap plates to help them fully detach.</div>

<li>Dislodge the cells from the bottom of the dishes by gentle taps and resuspend the cells in 3 mL expansion media.</li>
<li>Take 10 μL of the suspension and count the number of cells using a cell counter.</li>
<li>Take appropriate number of cells (∼30,000 for each microfluidic device) and centrifuge at 500×g for 3 min.</li>
<li>Discard supernatant and collect the cell pellet.</li>
<li>Resuspend cell pellets in 30 uL prechilled differentiation media containing Matrigel at 1:10 ratio of media to Matrigel.

<p>The key to measure Aβ from cell bodies and from axons is to calculate the number of axons generated from each capillary after 10-day differentiation of FAD hNPCs in the 3D-2D microfluidic chambers. We counted ∼300 axons per chambers from 30,000 cells seeded in the somal compartments (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>C–1G).

<li>To calculate Aβ from only cell bodies follow this formula:</li>
</ol>
<p>Concentration of Aβ (in pM) from cell bodies alone = the bulk Aβ concentration (from 30,000 bulk neurons) in pM minus the pM concentration of the axonal Aβ multiplied by 30,000 (total cells plated) /333 (average number of axons counted).</p>
<p>This will provide the concentration of Aβ (in pM) from cell bodies alone. In our case we obtained approx. 380 pM Aβ from the bulk neuron containing 30,000 cells (somal compartment) and approx. 3.5 pM Aβ from the axonal compartment containing 333 axons. Based on this we measured that the axons in the somal compartments would contribute to 3.5 × 30,000/300 pM amount of Aβ, which was subtracted from the bulk neuron Aβ (∼380 pM). This gave us 30–140 pM Aβ from cell bodies alone (<a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>).</p>

We only counted the number of axons sprouting from the tip of the capillaries. Use model cells similar to FAD hNPCs that produce significant level of Aβ so that would be sufficient to calculate axonal Aβ even by counting only the axons extending out of the capillaries separating the somal and the axonal compartments.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Using the 3D microfluidic chambers, we routinely obtain 10–12 × 10<sup>8</sup> molecules of Aβ from each cell bodies and about 2–3 × 10<sup>8</sup> Aβ from each axon from ∼30,000 FAD hNPCs seeded at the somal groove in 3D microfluidic chambers and differentiated for 10–14 days (<a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a> and <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D). The amount may vary depending on the detectable levels of Aβ. However, the key to the experiment is to observe little or no Aβ release in the axonal chambers when cells are treated with NE-100 that reduces axonal MAM levels ((<a href="#bib1">Bhattacharyya et al., 2021</a>) and <a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>E–1G).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Limitation 1</h3>
<p>Our protocol describes a detailed method to measure the number of Aβ molecules derived from axons or from cell bodies of a well-characterized neural cellular model of AD, namely FAD NPCs that were differentiated in 3D inside commercially (Xona) available microfluidic two-chamber devices.</p>
<p>Although our method was only applied to FAD hNPCs, we speculate that the protocol will be applicable for other neuronal cells such as naïve hNPCs or primary neurons. However, the major limitation of our method is that it can reliably detect axonal Aβ<sub>40</sub>, but not Aβ<sub>42</sub>, because the number of axons in the axonal chambers of the microfluidic devices was insufficient to obtain detectable level of Aβ<sub>42</sub>. It is important to detect Aβ<sub>42</sub> level along with Aβ<sub>40</sub> because the degree of dementia in AD largely corelates with the Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio. In unpublished data we have been able to detect axonal Aβ<sub>42</sub> levels by employing a single-cell-derived clonal hNPCs overexpressing FAD mutants of APP (APP<sub>Swe/Lon</sub>) and γ-secretase (PS1ΔE9), namely HRen-mGAP#A4H1 cells that generated high level of Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio when differentiated in 3D (<a href="#bib5">Kwak et al., 2020</a>). In addition to using HRen-mGAP#A4H1 cells, we also employed a more sensitive Aβ detection method namely MSD assay (Meso Scale Discovery, CA).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Limitation 2</h3>
<p>We have also described a versatile protocol of axotomy to isolate pure axons from FAD hNPCs differentiated in our in-house microfluidic two-chamber devices.</p>
<p>We have used this method and successfully detected a series of MAM-associated proteins namely IP3R3, VDAC1, and ACAT1 in the purified axons of FAD hNPCs. We have demonstrated that inactivation of MAM-associated sigma-1 receptor (S1R) downregulated axonal MAM-proteins (<a href="#bib1">Bhattacharyya et al., 2021</a>). We speculate that our protocol will be able to isolate pure axons and axonal proteins from other neuronal cells including naïve hNPCs and primary neurons. However, our protocol is limited to the isolation of axonal proteins, but not that of somal proteins because the somal compartments of microfluidic chambers contain bulk neurons. Thus, to compare the effect of axonal versus somal proteins on axonal and/or somal Aβ production, we will require more sophisticated microfluidic chambers. A prototype of such chamber is under preparation in our laboratory.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec8.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The Matrigel solution (1:10) for making 3D matrix starts to polymerize too early, or while transferring the Matrigel-containing cell suspension into the somal grooves (step 2h).</p>
<h3 id="sec8.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Keeping every solution and the tubes and the pipet tips chilled at 4°C can solve the problem (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>A–3C). If the gel solidifies, it creates bubbles inside the somal groove. Keeping the solutions and the materials cold and allowing a smooth flow of the cell suspension inside the grooves will prevent bubble formation. Even after taking all precautions bubbles may be formed (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D). We recommend discarding the microfluidic chamber and start afresh. This is the primary reason to use in-house microfluidic chambers over commercially available microfluidic chambers to keep the cost of the experiments reasonable.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="sec8.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The color of the differentiation media changes to yellow in 1–2 days in the somal chambers and the axons are not formed in the capillaries (step 2m).</p>
<h3 id="sec8.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Keeping the cell numbers ∼30,000 per microfluidic somal chamber may solve the problem. However, media color also changes due to evaporation of the media. Because the volume of media in the somal compartment is small (∼200 μL) evaporation of media is expected. Always keep the chambers inside a 100 mm culture dish with a lid. If the discoloration or drying of the media persists (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A), carefully add extra media around the chambers (this will preserve the media which is expensive) or flood the culture dish with media (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B). On the day of treatment, place the microfluidic chamber inside a fresh culture dish without flooding with media. Add exact volume of media to the somal and axonal chambers containing the appropriate concentration of drugs. For example, 180 μL 10 μM PRE-084/NE-100 in each somal chamber and 150 μL 10 μM PRE-084/NE-100 in each axonal chamber to test the effect of PRE-084/NE-100 on somal and axonal Aβ. Keep the treatment time no more than 24 h to avoid any evaporation or discoloration of the media.</p>

<h3 id="sec8.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Axonal chambers are contaminated with bulk neurons (step 2n).</p>
<h3 id="sec8.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This problem is more common with the commercial Xona microfluidic slides compared to the in-house devices because the capillaries of the Xona devices are thicker (accommodate ∼3 axons per capillary) than the capillaries of our custom-made in-house devices (accommodate 1 axon per capillary) (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). To solve this problem, carefully monitor under a light microscope that no cell enters the capillaries and the 3D matrix (1:10 Matrigel) is quickly formed inside the somal groove while adding the cell mixture to the microfluidic device (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B, c and d). It is also noteworthy that each lot of Matrigel has a different protein concentration, therefore every lot needs to be pretested. We use 1:10 dilution of Matrigel to make thin 3D matrix inside somal grooves. However, 1:15 or 1:20 dilutions may also be used as is described by <a href="#bib3">Kim et al. (2015)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec8.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Increasing the number of cells in the somal chambers does not increase axonal protein amounts after axotomy (step 26m).</p>
<h3 id="sec8.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>100,000 FAD hNPCs per microfluidic chamber is sufficient to isolate ∼30 μg of axonal protein after 10-day differentiation. However, more amount of axonal protein is required to study subcellular distribution of proteins of interest such as axonal MAM-distribution of APP, IP3R3 or VDAC1. Increasing cell numbers does not increase axonal protein amount after axotomy because the number of axons in the microfluidic chambers is dependent on the number of capillaries connecting the somal and the axonal compartments, which remains fixed for each microfluidic chamber (450 capillaries per in-house microfluidic chamber slides). To obtain more than 30 μg axonal proteins, the number of microfluidic chamber slides will have to be increased. We have isolated ∼200 μg axonal proteins from 5 in-house microfluidic chambers. Alternatively, more axonal proteins can be isolated by allowing longer differentiation time. We differentiate FAD hNPCs for 10 days prior to axotomy and extraction of axonal protein. More than 1 week differentiation is sufficient to study Aβ pathology in FAD hNPCs. However, to study tau-pathology, which is another hallmark of AD, FAD hNPCs has been differentiated for 3 weeks or longer without any adverse effect on cell viability (<a href="#bib5">Kwak et al., 2020</a>). Increasing the length of differentiation from 10 days to 3 weeks will generate ∼2-fold increase in the amount of total axonal proteins.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Even when axonal protein amount is high, Western blot does not detect protein of interest.</p>
<p>Axonal chambers are contaminated with bulk neurons (step 26n).</p>
<h3 id="sec8.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Matrigel is made of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The amount of protein from the Matrigel (1:10) in the somal chamber is negligible compared to significantly high level of proteins extracted from bulk neurons in the somal compartments. In contrast, the amount of axonal protein isolated from the capillaries and the axonal compartments is significantly low. If small amount of Matrigel enters the capillaries while adding cells (in 1:10 Matrigel) in the somal groove (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A) before differentiation, the proteins in the Matrigel may contaminate axonal proteins. Protein estimation will erroneously show higher amount due to Matrigel proteins, while the actual axonal protein level is low. To solve this problem, carefully monitor under a light microscope that the cell mixture (in 1:10 Matrigel) solidifies inside the somal groove and does not enter the capillaries of the microfluidic chamber slides.</p>
