<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Lectin histochemical analysis of tissues combined with immunohistochemistry is a valuable tool to characterize and correlate the spatial distribution of glycans with the presence of specific cell types or antigens of interest. The current protocol describes the application of monosaccharide motif specificity of lectin binding to glycan residues to different tissue types. In addition, we describe stereological methods to provide further quantification of the analyzed tissues.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib7">Mohd Isa et al. (2018)</a>, <a href="#bib3">Contessotto et al. (2020)</a>, and <a href="#bib11">Samal et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Experimental design considerations</h3>
<ol>
<li>Lectin/antibody staining with fluorescently tagged lectins or antibodies should be ideally performed in frozen (cryostat) tissue sections (either from human or animals), with a thickness that can vary between 5 and 10 μm to enable also high resolution imaging (maximum thickness of 10 μm would prevent super-imposition of histological features). In our experience, paraffin embedded tissue sections increase the non-specific binding of fluorescently labeled lectins, enhancing background staining. The use of permanently positively charged glass slides (SuperFrost Plus) is strongly recommended to avoid the detachment of the tissue sections during this procedure.</li>
<li>Throughout the whole staining procedure, tissue sections need to be protected from direct light exposure as fluorescently (e.g., FITC/TRITC-) labeled lectins quench more quickly than Alexa Fluor-labeled probes. Additionally, stained sections should be imaged within 4 days to ensure specific binding. Fluorescently labeled lectins should be stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stock solutions (after reconstitution, in case the lectin is purchased as a powder) should be aliquoted and kept at −20°C for long-term storage, or at 4°C for up to 1 month. Avoid freeze-thawing cycles and always protect fluorescently labeled lectins from direct light exposure.</li>
<li>An optimization of lectin concentration and incubation time should be done to ensure the optimal concentration will be used in the following analyses (suggested concentrations for the titration: 5 μg/mL, 10 μg/mL, 15 μg/mL, 20 μg/mL). Please note that optimal concentrations will depend on the lectin as well as on the tissue used. The optimal concentration of lectin to be used is achieved when an increase in concentration above the optimal concentration does not increase the degree of staining of the tissue.</li>
<li>While the optimal concentration is being determined, the specific negative (inhibitory) control needs to be performed in parallel. Specifically, the lectin should be incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the sugar it is specific for (haptenic sugar) before staining the tissue section (selection of relevant lectins as well as their respective haptenic sugars is described in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>). This will enable the binding of the lectin to the sugar, resulting in the reduced binding to the tissue and subsequent decreased signal intensity, confirming the lectin specificity. It is also important to perform a positive control in parallel during the optimization step to guarantee that in case there is no labeling, it is not due to technical errors. Additionally, both negative and positive controls should be included in every batch of lectin labeling to ensure successful and specific labeling.

</li>
<li>In parallel, perform haptenic sugar inhibition controls by pre- and co-incubating each lectin with 100 mM of the appropriate sugar in TBS-T at RT (~18°C–23°C) (<a href="#bib1">Akimoto and Kawakami, 2014</a>). See <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> for list of haptenic sugars to use with a selection of relevant lectins. Lectins should be prepared in the relevant sugar in TBS-T and pre-incubated for at least 30 min before adding to the tissue and continuing the sugar-lectin co-incubation on the tissue. A positive control should also be performed in parallel to ensure successful labeling. This could be done by using a tissue section that has been reported to display the glycan residues the lectin is specific to (<a href="#bib1">Akimoto and Kawakami, 2014</a>).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The specificity of a lectin is characterized by the sugar residue that inhibits the interaction between the lectin-binding site(s) and its respective glycan. This sugar (haptenic sugar) displays a competitive binding to the lectin-binding sites in relation to the carbohydrate motifs present in the tissue sample (<a href="#bib9">Marks and Rodnight, 1978</a>; <a href="#bib5">Gerlach et al., 2012</a>). Decreased binding in the presence of the haptenic sugar indicates the specificity of the lectin for the sugar. Complete inhibition (negative labeling) might also occur in some cases; however, this does not always happen and it is more common to expect a marked diminution in labeling intensity. No change in binding intensity indicates that lectin binding to the tissue was non-specific or mediated by a non-carbohydrate binding site on the lectin.</div>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Quantifying area of tissue fluorescence with ImageJ/FIJI</h3>
<p>Stereology quantification is one method that may be adopted to calculate the percentage (%) volume fraction of detectable lectin binding in each tissue sample. Lectin histochemical binding fluorescence should be obtained from eight to ten microscopic views of each slide with three technical and at least three biological replicates using FIJI/ ImageJ software version 1.51 (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). This is the recommended number of fields to acquire if magnification is 20×; however, if magnification used increases, then the number of fields acquired should increase as well. The use of z-stack image capture is recommended to reduce error in image focusing and perceived image intensity. Volume fraction (Vv) is calculated by quantifying the area fraction of the positively stained component divided by the total area of interest and converting into a percentage (%) as below:</p>
<p><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/353-Si1.jpg" alt="Si1.jpg"></p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Although lectin histochemistry is an easy, quick, and straightforward protocol to establish across research groups focused on different fields, it has some limitations associated to it. The most important one would be that even though lectins can be used to detect carbohydrates in both glycoproteins and glycolipids, they can only discriminate between the identity of the actual carbohydrate residues present and not the nature of the glycosylated molecule. Additionally, lectins detect mainly terminal residues (<a href="#bib12">Varki et al., 2009</a>), and cannot elucidate the sequence of the entire oligosaccharide chain. For further information on full glycan structures present or the nature of the glycosylation molecule, the sample may be enriched for the membrane or extracellular matrix portions for further analyses on the glycans (e.g., lectin microarrays and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS)). While highly informative in expert facilities, these investigative techniques remain highly challenging, with difficulty in interpretation and often require tissue-specific optimization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the use of fluorescently labeled lectins provides sharp and detailed images, and allows the co-staining with antibodies, it requires the imaging to be carried out within a short period of time post-staining, as their fluorescence fades within a few days.</p>
<p>The broad binding specificity of some lectins poses another significant limitation, since it might promote the binding of those lectins to structures that are not the ones of interest.</p>
<p>Moreover, the mostly qualitative (and only semi-quantitative) nature of this method presents some hurdles to an accurate quantification of the expression of each sugar residue in the tissue sample. This is due to the multivalent binding of lectins. Nonetheless, relevant stereological approaches can be further integrated in the analysis of the structures of interest (e.g., cellular membranes, extracellular matrix proteins). Quantification of lectin histochemistry images may be further validated using semi-quantitative western/lectin blotting techniques.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Sections detaching from charged glass slide (step 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>When performing vertical washes (in glass Coplin staining jars), it is possible that tissue sections start to detach. To prevent this, numerous approaches can be taken into consideration:
<ul>
<li>Solution 1: While cutting the sections in the cryostat and placing them onto the glass slides, they should be kept at room temperature for 30 min to 1 h to promote complete adherence of the tissue section to the glass.</li>
<li>Solution 2: Slides such as APES (aminopropyltriethoxysilane) treated glass slides may be used (instead of SuperFrost™ Plus slides) to increase tissue adherence (<a href="https://theolb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/molecular-biology/apes-treatment-of-slides.html">https://theolb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/molecular-biology/apes-treatment-of-slides.html</a>).</li>
<li>Solution 3: Before starting the staining, enough time should be given for the slides to be at room temperature, to ensure that the sections are completely attached to the glass slides.</li>
<li>Solution 4: If tissue is not already fixed, fix with PFA on slide to promote further adhesion.</li>
<li>Solution 5: While performing the staining, gently replace the buffer between washes and, when using shaking, select a low speed.</li>
<li>Solution 6: If the sections continue to detach, carry out all washes horizontally in a drop-wise fashion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>High fluorescence signal is detected in sections that were incubated with the haptenic sugar (inhibitory controls) (step 14 or 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If lectin binding is carbohydrate-mediated, by incubating a lectin with its haptenic sugar, the haptenic sugar will occupy the lectin-binding site and prevent the lectin from binding to the glycans in the tissue, leading to significantly decreased signal in those sections (complete abolition should not always be expected). Consult manufacturer’s instructions to confirm the most appropriate sugar to use. Additionally, it is worth noting that some lectins can only be inhibited by complex sugars and not monosaccharides, in which cases appropriately glycosylated glycoproteins should be employed (<a href="#bib2">Brooks and Hall, 2012</a>). If lectin binding is not significantly decreased in the presence of the haptenic sugar, lectin binding is either non-specific or mediated by the non-carbohydrate binding sites present in the lectin (<a href="#bib5">Gerlach, et al., 2012</a>). A different lectin with similar desired specificity should be selected in the latter case.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>High background staining/fluorescence signal (step 14 or 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>If a high background staining is detected, there are several steps that can be tried to reduce it. This can be due to several reasons:
<ul>
<li>Reason 1: Insufficient blocking of non-specific binding sites, which can be overcome by increasing the concentration of periodate-treated BSA or by extending the incubation period of the blocking step.</li>
<li>Reason 2: Excessive lectin concentration, incubation temperature, or incubation time. In these cases, it is advised to reduce the concentration of lectin and/or to incubate sections at 4°C instead of at room temperature and/or for a reduced period of time. Also, the lectin used could be potentially diluted in a buffer containing the blocking agent (e.g., 0.1% periodate-treated BSA in TBS-T or TBS). The use of other blocking agents (such as normal serum, which is frequently used in immunohistochemistry) is not appropriate as it possesses multiple glycosylated molecules, which might inhibit specific binding of lectins to the tissue or cause non-specific binding.</li>
<li>Reason 3: Number and duration of washes are too short. These can be increased to ensure that any lectin that is non-specifically bound is removed.</li>
<li>Reason 4: The tissue might have physiological structures/molecules that can cause auto fluorescence due to endogenous fluorophores (e.g., lipofuscin) (<a href="#bib4">Croce and Bottiroli, 2014</a>). To solve this problem, it is crucial to know the features and composition of the tissue and try to address them by finding a specific compound that can bind to these structures and reduce their auto fluorescence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>No fluorescence signal is detected in the stained tissue sections (step 14 or 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lack of fluorescence signal in the samples might be caused by multiple factors:
<ul>
<li>Factor 1: Not enough lectin is bound to glycans of interest, for which the recommended course of action would be to use a higher concentration of lectin, to incubate it during a longer period (e.g., 2 h or even 3 h) or to incubate it at a higher temperature (e.g., at 37°C).</li>
<li>Factor 2: The lectin might have been improperly stored (e.g., kept at room temperature for long periods or in an environment not protected from light), which could lead to quenching of its signal or loss of its function. To ensure that the lectin has kept its function and labeling, a positive control should be run in parallel in every staining experiment. This positive control should be a tissue known to express the glycosylation motif specific to that lectin as characterized by the literature or based on previous in-house experiments.</li>
<li>Factor 3: The specific glycosylation motif might not be present in the tissue sample. To confirm this, a positive control using a sample where this glycosylation motif has been reported to be found should always be run in parallel.</li>
<li>Factor 4: The fixation procedure may modify the glycan structure that is necessary for recognition by the lectin. To solve this issue, a shorter fixation period or a different fixation method are recommended.</li>
<li>Factor 5: TBS buffer might be contaminated with bacteria, which might alter its properties and compromise the staining and functions of the lectin. For this, it is advised to only use freshly prepared sterile-filtered or autoclaved TBS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The positive signal associated with the glycan distribution is not homogenous across the tissue section (step 14 or 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Consider the histological nature of the region of interest where the lectin binding is localized. Suppose the region of interest has an extended and multi-layered morphology (e.g., artery), suitable confocal high magnification imaging needs to be implemented to detect the different layers of these structures. Then, only the relative areas of interest in ImageJ should be selected for fluorescence intensity measurement.</p>
