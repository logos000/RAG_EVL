<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Many genetically encoded tools, including large collections of GAL4 transgenic lines, can be used to visualize neurons of the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> brain. However, identifying transgenic lines that are expressed sparsely enough to label individual neurons, or groups of neurons that innervate a particular brain region, remains technically challenging. Here, we provide a detailed procedure in which we used broadly expressed transgenic lines and two-photon microscopy to photo-label neurons with specificity, thereby permitting their morphological characterization.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib7">Li et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Experimental model and subject details</h3>
<p>Flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) were raised on standard cornmeal agar medium and maintained in an incubator set at 25°C, 60% humidity with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Crosses were set up and reared under the same conditions. Both male and female flies were used in all experiments. Details of genotypes used in this study and their sources are described in the <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Generate the transgenic flies necessary for the photo-labeling procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>This procedure requires <i>Drosophila</i> specimens that carry all the transgenes necessary to target the expression of a photo-activatable form of the green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP) — for instance SPA or C3PA (<a href="#bib4">Datta et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib10">Ruta et al., 2010</a>) — to the neurons of interest. Any of the available binary expression systems can be used (<a href="#bib6">Lai and Lee, 2006</a>; <a href="#bib8">Potter and Luo, 2011</a>). We used the GAL4/UAS binary expression system to drive expression of a combination of both SPA and C3PA. In particular, we used the <i>R19H07-GAL4</i> transgene — which is expressed in a large number of neurons, including the <sub>PLP</sub>PNs — as well as one copy of the <i>UAS-SPA</i> transgene and four copies of the <i>UAS-C3PA</i> transgene (<a href="#bib7">Li et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib10">Ruta et al., 2010</a>).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We found that increasing the number of copies of the <i>UAS-C3PA</i> and <i>UAS-SPA</i> transgenes yields better results, whereas increasing the number of copies of the <i>GAL4</i> transgene has little to no effect.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This protocol can be used to photo-label neurons in different <i>Drosophila</i> species. Here we used <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> but species for which similar transgenes are available, for instance <i>Drosophila sechellia</i> and <i>Drosophila simulans</i>, can also be used.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For better results, use adult flies that are 1 to 3 days old.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>When collecting images of the photo-labeled neuron using two-photon microscopy, make sure that its entire morphology of the selected neuron is clearly distinguishable from the background fluorescence. Morphological features — such as dendritic branches, axonal projections, and presynaptic boutons — should be clearly visible.</p>
<p><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C shows a photo-labeled neuron — in this case a <sub>PLP</sub>PN (white arrow) — among other neurons that also express PA-GFP but are not photo-labeled (gray arrows). The entire morphology of this photo-labeled neuron is clearly visible, including its dendrites, axonal projection, and presynaptic boutons (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C, yellow arrows). After imaging the neuron using two-photon microscopy, this sample was immuno-stained and imaged a second time using confocal microscopy (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E).</p>
<p><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D shows a group of photo-labeled neurons — here 13 <sub>PLP</sub>PNs (white arrows) — among other neurons that also express PA-GFP but are not photo-labeled. These neurons were recovered after photo-labeling the dorsal accessory calyx of the mushroom body (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D, white dashed outline), a region in which <sub>PLP</sub>PNs extend some of their axonal projections. After imaging the group of neurons using two-photon microscopy, the sample was immuno-stained and imaged a second time using confocal microscopy (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>F).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Although this protocol can be used to visualize most, if not all, neurons of the <i>Drosophila</i> brain, it has a few limitations. Successful photo-labeling largely depends on the number of PA-GFP molecules that are expressed in the neuron(s) of interest. This protocol is not suitable for transgenic lines that have very low expression levels. The position of the neuron(s) of interest within the brain can also affect results: neurons located in the center of the brain are typically more difficult to photo-label than neurons located in more superficial areas.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The pH and the osmolarity of the <i>Drosophila</i> adult hemolymph-like saline are not within the optimal range (step 8 of the <a href="#sec1.3">prepare the Drosophila adult hemolymph-like saline</a> section).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the pH of the saline is below 7.3, add 20 μL of the 10 M NaOH solution, one drop at a time, and measure the pH again. Repeat until the pH reaches around 7.3. If the pH of the saline if above 7.3, add Milli-Q system-treated water until the pH drops back around 7.3.</p>
<p>If the osmolarity is below the optimal range (265–275 mOsm), add 1–2 mL of 2 M trehalose solution and measure the osmolarity again. Repeat until the osmolarity reaches the optimal range. If the osmolarity is above the optimal range, add Milli-Q system-treated water until the osmolarity drops back to the optimal range.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The cell body of the neuron of interest cannot be located before starting the photo-labeling procedure (step 2 of the <a href="#sec3.1">photo-label individual neurons</a> section).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the cell body of the neuron of interest is located in the center of the brain, it may be difficult to image. A brief photo-labeling cycle that targets the dendritic branches or axonal projection of the neuron of interest can be used to facilitate the identification of its cell body. This brief photo-labeling cycle will lead to the photo-conversion of a small number of PA-GFP molecules within the neuron of interest, which will rapidly diffuse and increase its brightness.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>After performing several photo-labeling cycles, the targeted neuron, or group of neurons, is not clearly visible (step 7 and 29; <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>D).</p>
<figure id="fig6"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/508-Fig6.jpg" alt="Fig6.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 6. Examples of successful and unsuccessful photo-labeling</div>
<p>(A and B) A successfully photo-labeled single posterior lateral protocerebrum projection neuron (<sub>PLP</sub>PN) (A) and <sub>PLP</sub>PN population (B). The photo-labeled neurons are distinguishable from other neurons that also express photoactivatable GFP (PA-GFP) but are not photo-labeled.</p>
<p>(C) A photo-labeled <sub>PLP</sub>PN is dying due to damage incurred during the photo-labeling cycle, as evidenced by the degradation of the neuronal branches (white dashed box).</p>
<p>(D) Photo-labeled <sub>PLP</sub>PN populations driven by a weak transgenic line, as evidenced by neuronal branches that are barely visible after photo-labeling. The following genotypes were used in this figure: (A) <i>yw</i>/<i>yw</i>; <i>MB247-DsRed</i><sup>unknown</sup>, <i>UAS-C3PA-GFP</i><sup>unknown</sup><i>/UAS-SPA-GFP</i><sup>attP40</sup><i>; UAS-C3PA-GFP</i><sup>attP2</sup>, <i>UAS-C3PA-GFP</i><sup>VK00005</sup><i>, UAS-C3PA-GFP</i><sup>VK00027</sup><i>/R19H07-GAL4</i><sup>attP2</sup>; (B-C) <i>UAS-C3PA-GFP</i><sup>unknown</sup><i>/UAS-SPA-GFP</i><sup>attP40</sup>; <i>R19H07-GAL4</i><sup>attP2</sup><i>/R13F02-GAL4</i><sub>AD</sub><sup>VK00027</sup><i>, R85D07-GAL4</i><sub>DBD</sub><sup>attP2</sup>; (D) <i>UAS-C3PA-GFP</i><sup>unknown</sup><i>/CyO</i>; <i>R20G07-GAL4</i><sup>attP2</sup><i>/MKRS;</i>. Scale bar, 20 μm in all panels.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The targeted neuron could be dimly photo-labeled even after performing several photo-labeling cycles. This outcome most likely results from a low number of photo-converted PA-GFP molecules within the targeted neurons. The first solution is to increase the expression level of the PA-GFP molecules, namely by using different transgenic lines — either by selecting a promoter that expresses at higher levels in the neuron(s) of interest or by adding more copies of the <i>PA-GFP</i> transgenes. Alternatively, increasing the laser power that is used during the photo-labeling cycle, or increasing the number of photo-labeling cycles, can yield larger amounts of photo-converted PA-GFP molecules.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The targeted neuron is damaged and its axonal projection shows signs of degeneration (step 7 and 29; <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>C).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Signs of neuronal degeneration — such as fragmentation of the axonal projection — are detectable when the targeted neuron is injured (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>C). Such damage is irreversible. Exposure to high levels of laser power (&gt;30 mW) is the most likely cause for neuronal degeneration. Reducing the laser power that is used during photo-conversion of PA-GFP should yield better results.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Additional neurons are photo-labeled after running the photo-labeling procedure on the targeted neuron or brain region of interest (step 7 and 29).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Additional photo-labeled neurons primarily result from areas outside of the defined region of interest (ROI) also being photo-labeled. When defining the ROI for photo-labeling an individual neuron (step 3 of the <a href="#sec3.1">photo-label individual neurons</a> section), make sure the ROI sits well within the targeted neuron, make sure the ROI sits well within the targeted neuron (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). When defining the ROI for a particular brain region of interest (step 3 under the <a href="#sec3.3">photo-label a group of neurons</a> section), Make sure the ROI covers the region of interest only. In addition, set the laser power for the background (areas outside the defined ROI) to zero.</p>
