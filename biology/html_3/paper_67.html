<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The generation of homogeneous populations of subtype-specific cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is crucial in cardiovascular disease modeling as well as in drug discovery and cardiotoxicity screenings. This protocol describes a simple, robust, and efficient monolayer-based differentiation of hiPSCs into defined atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Cyganek et al., 2018</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have to be obtained and used according to the respective legal and ethical guidelines. hiPSCs and derivatives thereof are maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. All cell culture procedures are performed in a Class II biosafety cabinet using sterile conditions.</p>
<h3>Coating of Culture Plates</h3>
<p>For enhanced and homogeneous attachment of cells, culture plates must be coated with extracellular matrix proteins or protein mixtures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dilute Matrigel:</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>Thaw Matrigel (7-10 mg/ml) on ice at 4°C for 16-24 h.</li>
<li>Distribute Matrigel in 250 μl aliquots into 50 ml centrifuge tubes using ice-cold pipette tips and tubes, and directly freeze.</li>
<li>Store aliquots at -20°C for up to one year.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Coat cell culture-treated multi-well plates (e.g. 6-well plates):</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>Resuspend a frozen Matrigel aliquot in 29.75 ml cold PBS to obtain the working dilution of 1:120.</li>
<li>Add 1 ml of diluted Matrigel per well of a 6-well plate (approx. 6-9 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>) and ensure that the entire well surface is covered.</li>
<li>Incubate at 37°C for 60 min or at 4°C for 16-24 h.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Coated plates can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks, but should not be used if the Matrigel has dried up.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Instead of Matrigel, plates can also be coated with Geltrex (approx. 17 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>) or defined matrices such as recombinant Laminin-521 (approx. 0.9 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>).</div>

<h3>hiPSC Passaging and Maintenance</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10–20 min</div>
<p>hiPSCs are maintained under feeder-free conditions with daily medium changes and kept at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. When the cells reach 70-95% confluency, the cells can be passaged (approx. every 3-5 days).</p>
<ol>
<li>Prewarm Matrigel-coated plates, hiPSC Culture Medium and EDTA Dissociation Buffer to 20-25°C.</li>
<li>Aspirate Matrigel from the precoated culture plates and add hiPSC Culture Medium (2 ml per well of a 6-well plate).</li>
<li>Aspirate medium of hiPSCs. Cover the cells carefully with EDTA Dissociation Buffer (e.g. 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate) and directly aspirate again.</li>
<li>Cover the cells carefully with EDTA Dissociation Buffer (e.g. 1 ml per well of a 6-well plate) and incubate with minimal movement for 3-5 min.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The longer the incubation, the smaller the cell clumps will be. The optimal incubation time should be determined for each cell line; however, 3 min are sufficient for most cell lines.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Carefully aspirate solution and rapidly wash the cells off the well with 1 ml hiPSC Culture Medium (for 6-well), but avoid excessive pipetting to keep small clumps intact. The colonies will reattach quickly when not taken off the plate.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If overtreated with EDTA and already detached from the plate, the cells could be collected, diluted in medium (e.g. 1:1), centrifuged at 200 × <i>g</i> for 5 min, and resuspended in fresh medium.</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Plate the desired amount onto the prepared Matrigel-coated plates with medium (e.g. 1:6-1:10 or count and plate defined cell number). Add 1 μl/ml of 2 mM Thiazovivin (final concentration 2 μM) for the first 24 h.</li>
<li>Shake the plate carefully to distribute the cells evenly and incubate at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>.</li>
<li>Change the medium every day to 2 ml hiPSC Culture Medium per well of a 6-well plate.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> On one day per week (when the cells are less than 50% confluent), the medium change can be skipped. For this, add 3 ml of hiPSC Culture Medium per well of a 6-well plate the day before and then return to daily medium changes after 48 h.</div>
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause Point:</span> For differentiation of hiPSCs into cardiomyocytes, continue with step 22 (see ‘Subtype-Directed Differentiation of hiPSCs into Atrial and Ventricular Cardiomyocytes’). If hiPSCs are not intended to be differentiated shortly, they can be cryopreserved when they have reached a confluency of 70-95% (see ‘hiPSC Cryopreservation’, steps 9-14) and recovered for culture when needed (see ‘hiPSC Recovery’, steps 15-21).</div>
<h3>hiPSC Cryopreservation</h3>
<div class="timing">

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10–20 min</div>

<li>Aspirate Matrigel from the precoated culture plates and add hiPSC Culture Medium (2 ml per well of a 6-well plate).</li>
<li>Add 9 ml of hiPSC Culture Medium to a 15 ml centrifuge tube.</li>
<li>Directly transfer the cryogenic vial to a 37°C water bath and observe the thawing process. When most the content of the tube is thawed and only a small chunk of ice remains, quickly take it out and clean thoroughly with 70% ethanol.</li>
<li>Carefully transfer the cells in a dropwise manner to the prepared 15 ml centrifuge tube with medium. Centrifuge at 200 × <i>g</i> for 5 min.</li>
<li>Carefully aspirate the supernatant. Resuspend the pellet in hiPSC Culture Medium (e.g. 1 ml) and plate on the prepared Matrigel-coated plates with medium. Add 1 μl/ml of 2 mM Thiazovivin (final concentration 2 μM) for the first 24 h.</li>
<li>If the cells are well attached after 24 h, perform medium change with hiPSC Culture Medium. In case of low attachment, add 1 μl/ml of 2 mM Thiazovivin (final concentration 2 μM) for another 24 h. From the next day onwards, change the medium daily to 2 ml of hiPSC Culture Medium per well (6-well). Continue with ‘hiPSC passaging and maintenance’, steps 1-8.</li>

<h3>Subtype-Directed Differentiation of hiPSCs into Atrial and Ventricular Cardiomyocytes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10–12 days</div>
<p>The cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs can be conducted along the atrial or the ventricular lineage. Both protocols comprise a series of medium changes as illustrated in the graphical abstract, in between which the cells are kept at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Although atrial and ventricular hiPSC-cardiomyocytes exhibit similar changes in morphology during differentiation (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), cultures of atrial cardiomyocytes typically contract significantly faster than ventricular cardiomyocyte cultures (see <a href="#mmc1">Videos S1</a> and <a href="#mmc2">S2</a>).</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Subtype-Directed Differentiation of hiPSCs into Atrial and Ventricular Cardiomyocytes</div>
<p>hiPSCs undergoing ventricular cardiac differentiation. By day 8-10, the cells typically start to beat and develop a characteristic ‘net-like’ morphology. Atrial cells exhibit similar morphological changes, but can be distinguished from ventricular cells by their higher beating frequency (see <a href="#mmc1">Videos S1 </a> and <a href="#mmc2">S2</a>). Consistent field of view over time is shown. Scale bar represents 100 μm.</p>

<h3>Digestion of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30–45 min</div>

<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Instead of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, you can use 10× TrypLE Select or Accutase.</div>
<h3>Metabolic Selection of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3–7 days</div>
<p>Metabolic selection can be performed in order to purify hiPSC-derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes after the differentiation. Provision of lactate as the only energy source is permissive of the survival of cells with cardiac-like metabolism only. To enhance selection efficiency and prevent detachment of cardiomyocytes, replate the cells at a lower density, ideally around day 15. The optimal time point for selection is between days 15-30, due to the cells’ high sensitivity to lactate associated with their proliferative state at this age; however, selection is possible until day 60.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Digest the differentiated cells as described in ‘Digestion of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes’ (steps 31-36). After resuspending the cells, count them using an automated cell counter or a hemocytometer, and plate in a lower density, e.g. at a ratio of 1:3 or at a defined cell number of 1-2×10<sup>6</sup> cells per well (6-well).</li>
<li>Allow cells to regenerate in Cardio Culture Medium for 3-5 days before starting the selection. Change the medium every 2-3 days.</li>
<li>Start the selection process by aspirating the spent medium and adding 2 ml per well (6-well) of Cardio Selection Medium.</li>
<li>Change the medium to 2 or 3 ml Cardio Selection Medium every 2 or 3 days, respectively, for the duration of the selection process (e.g. 2 ml on Monday and Wednesday, 3 ml on Friday).</li>
<li>To stop the selection, switch to Cardio Culture Medium. Change the medium to 2 ml of Cardio Culture Medium and change this medium every 2 or 3 days thereafter (e.g. 2 ml on Monday and Wednesday, 3 ml on Friday).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The incubation time in Cardio Selection Medium is dependent on the age of the cardiomyocytes: 3-5 days before day 30, and 5-7 days for cells between days 30 and 60 (see Troubleshooting Problem 4).</div>
<h3>Cryopreservation of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 h</div>
<p>hiPSC-derived atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes can be cryopreserved for long-term storage. To ensure pure populations, the cells should ideally be frozen after having passed through a digestion and selection process. Cryopreservation can be performed from day 15 after the start of differentiation onwards.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected Outcomes</h2>
<p>The protocol for the differentiation of hiPSCs towards atrial or ventricular cardiomyocytes described here has been adapted from and modified based on previously published protocols (<a href="#bib6">Zhang et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib3">Lian et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib5">Tohyama et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib1">Burridge et al., 2014</a>). It has been applied successfully to more than 50 hiPSC lines in our hands, and robustly yields 80-90% of cTNT<sup>+</sup> cardiomyocytes without significant differences between atrial and ventricular specification. Upon metabolic selection, the purity can be further increased. Within the cardiomyocyte population, this protocol generates approximately 90-95% of the desired atrial or ventricular subtype. At day 30 after the start of differentiation, approximately 1-3×10<sup>6</sup> atrial or ventricular cardiomyocytes can be obtained per well of a 6-well plate, into which 150,000-260,000 iPS cells have initially been plated 2-4 days before the start of differentiation, i.e. for every iPS cell plated, approximately 10 cardiomyocytes can be generated.</p>
<p>At ages of 20-90 days after start of differentiation (or even older), the cells can be applied in experiments or analyzed for cardiac characteristics, such as the expression of general cardiac markers (e.g. α-actinin, cTNT, RYR2) or subtype-specific markers (e.g. MLC2v and MLC2a for ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes, respectively). However, regarding the choice of experimentation time point it should be noted that the maturity of the cells will likely improve with prolonged culture time. The assembly of hiPSC-derived atrial or ventricular cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts into engineered heart muscle will further mature the cardiac cells and enables their investigation in a three-dimensional context (<a href="#bib2">Cyganek et al., 2018</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Our subtype-directed differentiation protocol provides relatively homogeneous cell populations for most hiPSC lines tested in our hands. However, differentiation efficiencies can vary significantly between cell lines. Although the protocol yields atrial/ventricular cardiomyocytes with purities of approximately 80-90%, a minimum of 10% cardiomyocytes of different lineages as well as non-cardiomyocytes can be found in the samples.</p>
<p>The hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes generated using this protocol display embryonic- or fetal-like properties when compared to adult cardiac tissue, as evaluated by functional, transcriptomic and proteomic phenotyping (<a href="#bib2">Cyganek et al., 2018</a>). However, the generation of three-dimensional tissue has been shown to increase the maturity of the two-dimensional cell populations and already more closely reflects the <i>in vivo</i> situation (<a href="#bib4">Tiburcy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>The hiPSCs differentiate on their own already in maintenance culture OR the hiPSCs do not differentiate well into cardiac cells upon application of the directed differentiation protocol.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Check for pluripotency of the starting hiPSC population, e.g. by assessing marker expression and trilineage differentiation potential. Verify that the hiPSC line displays a normal karyotype.</p>
<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>Excessive cell death and detachment happens during/after CHIR99021 treatment.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>A substantial loss of cells is expected at this point. However, if most of the cells are lost, the differentiation will fail. Try to optimize the CHIR99021 concentration applied on day 0 of differentiation between 3-8 μM – this can vary between cell lines. Alternatively, try to optimize the starting cell density for the differentiation.</p>
<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>During long-term culture of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, clusters of beating cells start to detach.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>The differentiated cells can be digested and replated in a lower cell density (if they were too dense) onto new coated plates.</p>
<h3>Problem 4</h3>
<p>Cardiac cells detach in whole clusters during metabolic selection.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate dead cells from the cell cultures during the selection process and therefore save the cardiac cells, carefully collect the medium (including the clusters in suspension) and flush it through a 40 μm mesh. Then turn the filter and carefully wash off the collected clusters into fresh Cardio Selection Medium. Transfer the cell suspension into a new coated well.</p>
