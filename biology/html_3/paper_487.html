<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Animal models of liver cancer are instrumental in the study of hepatocarcinogenesis and development of novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we describe steps to establish liver cancer in a rat model, via chronic administration of diethylnitrosamine. This causes liver tumors with a sequential progression of hepatitis, cirrhosis, and tumor formation, which closely mimics the development of human liver cancer. This protocol was optimized to significantly increase the incidence of liver tumor formation and reduce the duration of the procedure.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Chen et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</h2>
<p>Most models of experimental liver carcinogenesis use mice. However, they common lack the typical features of chronic human liver disease that promote HCC development such as chronic injury, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. In humans, HCC develops in a chronically injured liver in 80% of the cases. In addition, mice develop HCCs with a low incidence when treated with DEN (<a href="#bib3">Heindryckx et al., 2009</a>).</p>
<p>Chronic administration of DEN in rats causes liver tumors with a sequential progression of hepatitis, cirrhosis, and tumor formation. Comparing to the 34% of induction rate for mice, recent studies demonstrated that Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats treated with 10 weekly doses of DEN (70 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) develop HCC with up to 80% (<a href="#bib1">CavigLia and Schwabe, 2014</a>). This DEN-induced rat HCC model closely mimics the development of human liver cancer, which typically involve sequential stimuli for initiation and progression (<a href="#bib4">Magee and Barnes, 1956</a>). This protocol is aimed to generate a genotoxic hepatocarcinogenesis model in rats (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The rat model of DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis has helped in our understanding of molecular events in HCC. Importantly, this model closely mirrors human liver cancer development, which undergoes a sequential progression of toxic hepatitis, fibrosis or cirrhosis, and ultimately HCC. So it allow us to further identify key cell populations involved in this process and define genetic drivers of human HCC. Here, we used a well-established protocol to generate a genotoxic hepatocarcinogenesis (<a href="#bib8">Solt et al., 1977</a>; <a href="#bib7">Solt et al., 1983</a>; <a href="#bib6">Scherer and Emmelot, 1976</a>).</p>
<p>In this experimental model, 36 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered 10 once-weekly doses of DEN for 10 weeks. Twelve rats were sacrificed at 5<sup>th</sup> weeks, 13<sup>th</sup>/14<sup>th</sup> weeks, and 23<sup>rd</sup>/24<sup>th</sup> weeks, respectively.</p>
<p>At the 5<sup>th</sup> week after the first DEN administration, inflammatory infiltration occurred in 9 of 12 rats (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Pathological histology in livers from this group showed hepatocyte swelling, expansion of some portal areas, and inflammatory cell infiltrating in portal duct areas (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). At the 14<sup>th</sup> week, liver cirrhosis occurred in 10 of 12 rats, and one of 12 rats developed HCC (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Results of pathological sections showed fibrous tissue hyperplasia, fibrous bands, and significant portal-to-portal and portal-to-central bridging with pseudolobular formation in livers from this group (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). At the 24<sup>th</sup> week, 7 of 12 rats developed multiple, macroscopically identifiable tumors, and among which 6 developed HCC (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Tumor nodule from livers showed tumor cells arranged irregularly, small cell change with high cell density and cytological atypia (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). Furthermore, livers contained not only HCC but also adenocarcinoma histologically at the 24<sup>th</sup> week.</p>

Pathological histology in livers from hepatitis group showed hepatocyte swelling, expansion of some portal areas, and inflammatory cell infiltrating in portal duct areas.

Pathological histology in livers showed tumor cells arranged irregularly, small cell change with high cell density and cytological atypia.

</figure>
<p>The pathologic changes to the liver in rats treated with DEN resembled those associated with human hepatocarcinogenesis. A comparison of carcinogen-induced rat mutations by using whole-exome sequencing with TCGA liver HCC revealed substantial overlap in the enrichment of signaling pathway genes harboring consequential mutations. The somatic mutational landscape of DEN-induced rat HCC reflects the tumor architecture in human HCC (<a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, the evaluation of HCC by advanced molecular biological methods, such as the second generation, third generation sequencing technology, will allow a better and more sensitive characterization of tumor development. This model may also be useful for preclinical testing of cancer therapeutics.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>It is essential to ensure that the appropriate dose of DEN solution is completely injected into abdominal cavity. Ensure the position of the rat before inserting the insulin syringe. When inserting the syringe into the abdominal cavity, the rats will struggle. Make sure that the needle remains at the right position in the abdominal cavity while injecting the DEN solution.</p>
<p>In addition, to get reproducible results, determining the body weight of the rats and watching for signs of distress are frequently important in estimating the disease severity. In most cases, experimental rats should have increased the weight slowly after the first injection. However, if the weight is &lt;90% of the initial weight, rats should be omitted from further experimentation, or dose of DEN for this rat may be decreased in subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>Generally, it is difficult to distinguish fibrosis and cirrhosis strictly. They always occur simultaneously.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>No or very few tumors.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is one of the most common reasons for failure of the protocol. Try to switch to a rat strain with higher susceptibility. F344 rats are more susceptible to DEN-induced carcinogenesis than Wistar or Brown Norway rats.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>High variability within experimental groups</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is essential to ensure that the appropriate dose of DEN solution is completely injected into the abdominal cavity. Ensure precise injection technique. Tightly hold the rat in a vertical position, and place the body of the rat straight. While holding the rat with one hand, apply with the other hand. Ensuring that the needle remains at the right position in the abdominal cavity while injecting the DEN solution. This procedure should be performed by well-trained personnel.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Rats become weak or show signs of compromised health status.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Carefully monitor the animals, performing daily determination of weight and watching for signs of distress. If the weight is &lt;90% of the initial weight, rat should be omitted from further experimentation, or dose of DEN for this rat may be decreased in subsequent experiments.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Hard to confirm the progression state of the liver based on the number of weeks after DEN treatment.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Usually, inflammatory infiltration occurred at the 5<sup>th</sup> week after the first DEN administration. Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis occurred at the 14<sup>th</sup> week after DEN administration. However, the time of when the rats display hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis depend on the sensitivity to DEN treatment. For example, rats, which are too low in body weight or highly susceptible to DEN, may develop fibrosis within 5 weeks. So when you establish the HCC model for the first time, include an additional subgroup of rats in order to confirm the sequential progression state of the liver. Three weeks after the first injection, sacrifice one or two rats every week to assess hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis state.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Low incidence of tumor formation.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If less than 60% of the animals develop liver carcinoma, try to extend the experiment time. Try to sacrifice the rats at 32 weeks after the first injection. The incidence of tumor formation may optionally be noninvasively monitored by <i>in vivo</i> imaging of tumor using an IVIS Spectrum CT system.</p>
