<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We recently established a simple and versatile adeno-associated virus (AAV) induction approach that enables dense (&gt;90% labeled neurons) and cortical-wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor expression. Here, we describe the stepwise protocol for neonatal AAV injection of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor. We also detail the steps for subsequent craniotomy to generate a chronic cranial window, followed by wide-field two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in an awake mouse. This protocol serves as an alternative to the use of transgenic animals and offers translatable options for cortical-wide experiments.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00713-9/sref7">Ota et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines and were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee at RIKEN. C57BL/6 mice (Japan SLC, Inc., Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan) were bred in our colony at RIKEN and maintained on a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (lights on 8 am to 8 pm) with <i>ad libitum</i> access to food and water. Pregnant mother mice were bred individually in each cage. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection protocol can be initiated once the pups are born (postnatal day 0, P0).</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Mating</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min (approximately 3 weeks before the experiment)</div>
<ol>
<li>Mate the mice of your interest at least 3 weeks before the experiment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In our laboratory, we set up a breeding cage by adding two or three healthy females with a single resident male.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>When the pregnancy is confirmed, isolate the pregnant female by placing her in a clean cage with fresh nesting material and a covered shelter where she can hide.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> By setting up a covered shelter in the home cage, the mother mouse can feel safe and take better care of the pups, which increases their survival rate.</div>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Pregnant mother mice may be purchased from the breeder.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of glass pipettes for injection</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Prepare appropriate quartz glass pipettes using a laser puller.
<ol type="a">
<li>The laser puller settings are presented in a table in the <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The shape of the glass pipettes is critical for successful injection. A thin, straight, long taper on the pipette helps with successful injection (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). In this protocol, the tip of the pipette must pierce the skull and the skin of the neonatal pup. Thus, a quartz capillary was selected. It is necessary to use a laser puller because the melting point of quartz glasses is higher than that of borosilicate glasses. Although borosilicate glass pipettes can be used, quartz glass pipettes reduce the possibility of breakage during insertion. A conventional micropipette puller can be used if borosilicate glass pipettes are used.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Cut and polish the tip of glass pipettes for injection.
<ol type="a">
<li>Cut the tip of the glass pipette to obtain an outer diameter of 50 μm and an inner diameter of 20 μm using forceps and a microforge.</li>
<li>Polish the tip of the glass pipette using a micro grinder, so it is beveled at 45°.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Mark the glass pipette at 2.82 cm intervals with a pen.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We used a 4 μL injection volume per animal in this study (step 2). A capillary length of 1.41 cm was used for a 1 μL volume because the inner diameter of the quartz capillary used in this study was 0.3 mm. To obtain a volume of 4 μL, a length of 5.68 cm was used.</div>

<ol type="a">
<li>Clean the coverslips by soaking them in ethanol and drying them on a clean piece of paper.</li>
<li>Place the cleaned coverslips on a piece of aluminum foil using forceps.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Apply a small drop of a UV-curing resin (NOA81) to the center of the larger coverslip (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A, ii).</li>
<li>Place the smaller coverslip onto the center of the larger coverslip (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A, iii) and gently push it. Ensure that there are no air bubbles.</li>
<li>Apply UV light for 1 h (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B).</li>
<li>Store the prepared double coverslips in an enclosed container at 20°C–25°C to avoid dust until use.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In this study, we used double-coverslip slides for the cranial window for wide-field two-photon imaging. To obtain a field-of-view (FOV) of 3 × 3 mm<sup>2</sup>, the imaging area of our wide-field two-photon imaging system, FASHIO-2PM, a coverslip of at least φ4.5 mm in diameter must be used. Making such a large cranial window is relatively difficult because of the curvature of the brain tissue. If a single coverslip is instead used for the cranial window, it may accidentally fall into the cranial hole when it is pushed to fully adhere to the brain tissue. The double coverslip makes it easier to form the cranial window because the edge of the larger coverslip remains on the edge of the cranial hole. This also helps fix the cranial window well with dental cement (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C). Moreover, as the experimenter does not have to worry about the cranial window falling during this procedure, the cranial window can be successfully pushed to be fully attached to the brain tissue, thus reducing tissue movement during two-photon imaging.</div>

The tip of the glass pipette stops in the middle of the cortical layer, so that the dye (shown in green) slowly spreads throughout the cortex. (C, iii) Coronal view of a failed injection: too deep injection depth. The pipette tip reaches the lateral ventricles (LV), so the dye quickly spreads in LV. (C, iv) Coronal view of a failed injection: too shallow injection depth. The pipette tip does not penetrate the cortical layer, so the dye accumulates between the skin and the brain tissue.</p>
<p>(D) Examples of successful injection. The dye spreads throughout the hemisphere and does not leak to the opposite hemisphere after the injection. Red circles indicate the injection point for each pup.</p>
<p>(E and F) Examples of failed injection. (E) The dye did not spread throughout the hemisphere. Red circles indicate the injection point for each pup. (F, i) An example of an injection point that was too deep. The dye was observed at three locations: (a) near the injection point, (b) at the right hemisphere forming a crescent shape, and (c) at the left hemisphere forming a crescent shape. The crescent formation is often observed when the pipette tip reaches the LV. Inset is the magnified view. Dashed line indicates the crescent shape, which is the result of the loaded dye accumulating in LV. (F, ii) An example of an injection point that was too shallow. The tip of the glass pipette did not reach the cortex layer and stayed beneath the skin, causing the AAV solution to accumulate between the skull and the skin, leading to skin swelling. (F, iii) An example of an injection using a pipette with a thick tip. Although the dye spreads throughout the hemisphere, the AAV solution overflows under the skin when the injection pipette is withdrawn because the tip used was too thick.</p>

If the depth is too shallow, the tip of the pipette will not reach the cortex and stay just below the skin, causing the AAV solution to accumulate between the skull and the skin, leading to skin swelling (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>C, iv and 3F, ii).</div>
</li>
<li>Manually inject 4 μL of AAV solution into the cortex at a speed of 4 μL/min by slowly pushing the syringe. If the injection is successful, the green dye slowly spreads throughout the hemisphere (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>C, ii and 3D).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The manual injection consists of two shots: the first shot is the injection of a small amount (∼300 nL), and the second shot is the injection of ∼ 3.7 μL of AAV solution (i.e., 100–200 nL solution is left in the pipette). The purpose of the first shot is to check whether the injection depth is correct. When it is correct, the dye is observed as a small dot at the injection site after the administration of the first shot (within 10 seconds after the start of injection, 00:09–00:10 in <a href="#mmc1">Methods video S1</a>). When a small dot is not observed, slight adjustments should be made to find a better depth at which a small dot of the dye appears following the injection of a small amount of the AAV solution. After confirmation, a second shot with higher volume (3–4 μL) is performed. When the injection is successful, the dye will slowly spread throughout the hemisphere and will not leak into the opposite hemisphere (00:20–00:24 in <a href="#mmc1">Methods video S1</a>, <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The area and brightness of sensor expression across the cortex depend on the volume of AAV solution injected (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>C). We found that the injection of 4 μL AAV solution per animal achieved consistent results for cortical-wide expression. We did not find any developmental differences between the pups injected with 4 μL of AAV solution and those without. In addition, the injection of the 4 μL AAV solution was effective even at different injection depths. In step 2d-iii, if the initial spread of the injected dye appears to be different, the experimenter can adjust the depth of the injection to find the correct depth.</div>

</li>
<li>Drill a groove along the mark made in step 11-g using a drill.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To avoid heat damage to the brain tissue, we recommend using a drill speed of 1000–5000 rpm. It takes roughly 30–60 min to complete drilling along the large mark (diameter 4.5 mm) of the cranial window. Remove small bone fragments or dust generated during drilling using air duster or suction. We recommend opening the cranial window very gently. The groove for a craniotomy of φ4.5 mm may overlap with the cranium joint, and this can easily cause bleeding if the groove is drilled roughly. Thus, gentle drilling is recommended to prevent bleeding during a large craniotomy.</div>
</li>
<li>Apply NRR to the groove, gently remove the island of the grooved skull by lifting it with fine forceps, and expose the dura mater.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It takes approximately 10–20 min to completely remove the skull with no bleeding. Apply NRR constantly so that when removing the skull, the dura mater can be easily detached. If the skull is removed before the dura mater is detached, bleeding from the dura will occur. If bleeding occurs, rinse the surface of the dura with the NRR solution until it stops.</div>

<li>Remove the exposed dura mater with fine forceps (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>B).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is better to leave the dura mater intact because its removal may cause microglial activation in some cases. In our study, transient activation of microglia was observed by removing the dura. This activation peaked at 2 weeks post-surgery and returned to the normal level after up to 6 weeks post-surgery (<a href="#bib7">Ota et al., 2021</a>; Figures S13A–S13C). We usually wait for more than six weeks to conduct chronic two-photon imaging experiments (<a href="#bib7">Ota et al., 2021</a>).</div>
In general, the presence of the dura mater interferes with the efficiency of the two-photon excitation and the collection of emission light from the specimens, which reduces the SNR. Moreover, the excitation time per pixel (called dwell time) is shorter in wide-field and high-speed imaging systems than in conventional two-photon systems. This shortening of dwell time also decreases the SNR. Therefore, the dura mater was removed in our study to improve the SNR.</li>

<p>The sensor expression area in the cortex in the “<a href="#sec3.3">transcranial expression check</a>” (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>) was quantified using ImageJ software (<a href="#bib8">Schneider et al., 2012</a>). The normalized expression area was calculated as follows: E<sub>A</sub>/C, where E<sub>A</sub> is the number of pixels of the expression area and C is the number of pixels of the cortex region in each experimental condition. The expression area was selected with fluorescence intensity above a certain threshold (set as the same value for all the conditions) using the “Threshold” tool. The cortex region was selected manually using the “Freehand selection” tool.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol describes a quick AAV injection procedure in neonatal mice to express the gene of interest with high density throughout the cortex. It offers an alternative method to the use of transgenic animals. It also saves time because many experimental conditions, such as the types of AAVs and sensors, can be tested in a high-throughput manner because of the quick injections. However, because gene expression approximately takes 2 weeks, our protocol is not suitable to study neural activity during the developmental stage.</p>
<p>Although extra work is required compared with methods using transgenic animals, our protocol provides various options for functional and anatomical imaging studies, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging focusing on specific cell types by combining several transgenic mouse lines and Cre-dependent viral vectors, voltage imaging using AAVs to express voltage indicators, imaging with optogenetic manipulation by combining AAVs for Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors and optogenetic tools, or imaging with anatomical tracing proteins or dyes.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Fast green dyes with AAV solution did not spread throughout the hemisphere. The AAV solution overflowed when the injection pipette was withdrawn from the brain (Step 2).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The injection depth was not appropriate. When the injection depth is too deep, you can observe dye spread in a crescent formation (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>F, i). Contrarily, when the depth is too shallow, the dye spreads around the injection point only, and the solution accumulates between the skull and the skin (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>F, ii). Check the appearance of the dye after the first shot (injection of ∼300 nL) and adjust the depth slightly to find a better depth where a small dot of the dye will appear when a small amount of the AAV solution is injected.</p>
<p>If the injected solution overflows from the skin when the glass pipette is withdrawn, this could be due to one of these reasons: the tip of the pipette was thick, the tip has been broken during repeated injections for the littermates, or the pup’s head has moved during the injection. In the first and second cases, use a new glass pipette. In the third case, increase the level of anesthesia. Prolong the time for anesthesia administration in the next pup. If these two options do not work, wait for 1–2 min before withdrawing the glass pipette.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Pups’ survival rate is low (Step 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The pups might not have fully recovered after the injection before returning them to their mother. In general, mother mice stop caring for pups when they smell different or when their body temperature is low. Put some bedding from the home cage into the recovery box to retain the mother’s smell. Ensure that the pups’ body temperature has returned to normal by confirming their temperature with your hand before returning the pups to the mother’s cage.</p>
<p>C57BL/6 mother mice sometimes do not care for their babies. In this case, you can either take the pups to a foster mouse such as the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mouse or provide a covered shelter in the home cage to make the mother mouse feel safe and ensure that she takes good care of the pups.</p>
<p>If the survival rate does not improve after taking the abovementioned solutions, the AAV titer used might be too high for the mice; try a lower titer.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Strange features in AAV-injected mice, such as hyperactivity, bristled fur, or bad growth, are observed on monitoring (Step 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The AAV titer or the sensor that you chose may be toxic to mice. We systematically tested several combinations of promoters, sensors, and titers before determining the final conditions. We found that AAV with the synapsin promoter, G-CaMP7.09, and a working titer of 1.0 × 10<sup>11</sup> to 1.0 × 10<sup>13</sup> GC/mL resulted in a dense expression for two-photon imaging and did not cause toxicity in mice. Because an ideal condition will depend on the sensors and promoters you want to use, we recommend testing several conditions.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The expression of G-CaMP results in sparse labeling of cortical neurons and/or in local labeling (Step 6 or Expected outcomes).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, increase the titer of the AAV used. If this does not work, change the serotype because it may not be appropriate to yield a dense and wide expression. We found that AAV-DJ, AAV8, or AAV9 works well.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The cranial window becomes fogged before performing two-photon imaging, which reduces the SNR in the labeled neurons (Expected outcomes).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Rinse the surface of the brain tissue well with NRR before placing the double coverslip. If pieces of shaved bone are left in the cranial hole, they will damage the brain tissue and cause bleeding or inflammation, resulting in the fogging of the cranial window.</p>
