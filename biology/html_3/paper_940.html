<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Determining the antigen specificities of the endogenous T-cell repertoire is important for screening naturally occurring or therapy-induced T-cell immunity and may help identify novel targets for T-cell-based therapies. Here, we describe a rapid, sensitive, and high-throughput protocol for expanding antigen-specific T cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells <i>in vitro</i> following peptide stimulation and detecting antigen-specific effector cytokine formation by flow cytometry. Our approach can be applied to examining specific T-cell subsets from various tissues.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00464-0/sref10">Roudko et al. (2020)</a> and <a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00464-0/sref2">Cimen Bozkus et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The protocol below describes the specific steps for evaluating antigen-specific T cell responses following their expansion from human PBMCs. However, we have also successfully used this protocol with single cell suspensions isolated from human tumor tissues.</p>
<p>While the protocol we describe here is performed using bulk T cells in PBMCs, the same protocol can be used to evaluate antigen-reactivity within individual T cell subsets of interest by co-culturing sorted T cells with autologous or major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched antigen-presenting cells (APCs) at desired ratios. We have successfully performed such co-cultures with T cells and APCs seeded at 1:1 ratio. However, investigators should test varying ratios to determine the optimal T:APC ratio in their experiments.</p>
<p>All sterile procedures are performed in a Class II biological safety cabinet with standard aseptic technique. Cells are cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.</p>
<p>Please ensure that the investigators have access to a flow cytometer with multi-parameter capabilities. Alternatively, other methods, such as the enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) assay, can be utilized to detect T cell responses.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Peptide preparation</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–3 h</div>
<p>This protocol uses synthetic peptides to stimulate T cells, thereby enabling antigen-specific T cell proliferation and detection of antigen-induced effector cytokine production by T cells. Therefore, peptides spanning the entire protein sequence being tested should be synthesized prior to experiment start.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dissolve lyophilized peptides in an appropriate solvent and dilute to a desired concentration.
<ol type="a">
<li>Assure that the peptides are completely dissolved, and no aggregates are formed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for how to dissolve peptides and the duration of storage.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The final concentration of the peptide stock can be determined by the investigator. The solvent should not promote peptide degradation and be compatible with the experimental application. In general, we recommend DMSO as the initial solvent and a stock peptide concentration of 2–10 mM.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> It is important to limit the volume of DMSO used in peptide stocks. We recommend not exceeding a maximum final concentration of 0.1% DMSO in cell cultures.</div>
<ol start="2">

<p>Timing will change based on the number of the antigens being tested.</p>
<p>The following steps are performed on “Day 1”, using sterile reagents and aseptic technique. Here the goals are to induce the activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and to stimulate antigen-specific T cells. Adjuvants, namely Toll-like receptor agonists lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and R848, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, are used to induce APC activation, thereby enhancing their capacity to stimulate T cells (<a href="#bib8">Lovgren et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib11">Wesa and Galy, 2001</a>). Antigen-specific T cell expansion is achieved through stimulation of T cells by synthetic peptides. A single peptide or pooled peptides can be used depending on the experimental design. We have successfully used both short (8–12mers) and long (14-25mers) peptides. Routinely, we use pools of overlapping 15mers spanning the protein sequences of interest, which can elicit both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting the feasibility of antigen cross-presentation in this assay system (<a href="#bib2">Cimen Bozkus et al., 2019</a>). In general, we pool less than 20 peptides in order to avoid potential peptide competition. However, we have successfully detected antigen-specific T cell responses with pools containing up to 125 peptides.</p>

<p>The steps below are performed on “Day 9” using sterile reagents and aseptic technique. In this section expanded T cells are re-stimulated with peptides they were initially stimulated with to induce effector cytokine production, which enables the identification and enumeration of antigen-specific T cells. If pooled peptides were used for the initial stimulation, here pools can be deconvoluted by re-stimulating the cells with the individual peptides constituting each pool, thereby demonstrating the immunogenic peptides within pools. For example, if on “Day 1” cells were stimulated with a peptide pool containing peptides a, b, and c, to deconvolute on “Day 9”, we re-stimulate these expanded cells with the individual a, b or c peptides in separate wells to evaluate the individual contribution of each peptide to elicited T cell responses. Furthermore, these steps can be leveraged to study cross-reactivity of T cells, for example T cells expanded following initial stimulation with mutant peptides can be re-stimulated with corresponding wild type peptides.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Here we describe a rapid T cell assay protocol for the expansion of antigen-specific T cells from unfractionated human PBMCs. The use of unfractionated PBMCs in this robust and sensitive assay provides multiple advantages. It enables the testing of antigen-specific T cell responses even when the starting material is limited. We have successfully detected antigen-specific T cell responses by this assay using only 10<sup>5</sup> PBMCs. Furthermore, PBMCs include multiple antigen-presenting cell (APC) populations, such as monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), including conventional (cDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) subsets (<a href="#bib3">Collin and Bigley, 2018</a>). Although, their frequencies vary across individuals, monocytes and DCs make up 10%–20% and 1%–2% of PBMCs, respectively (<a href="#bib6">Kleiveland, 2015</a>). The presence of multiple APC populations within PBMCs is leveraged in this assay by treating PBMCs with a cytokine cocktail (GM-CSF, IL-4, and Flt3-L) that supports the development of distinct dendritic cell subsets (<a href="#bib9">Parajuli et al., 2001</a>), and maintains myeloid cell viability (Flt3-L), which together with adjuvants (LPS, R848, and IL-1β) helps elicit a greater magnitude of antigen-specific T cell responses compared to standard T cell assays lacking such components (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig1"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/940-Fig1.jpg" alt="Fig1.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Role of cytokine and adjuvant addition</div>
<p>PBMCs from HLA-A∗02+ healthy donors (n=4) were expanded following stimulation with MART-1 (ELAGIGILTV) or CEFT peptides with or without the addition of cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-4, Flt3-L) and adjuvants (LPS, R848, IL-1β) on Day 0 and Day 1, respectively. Percentage of IFN-γ+ CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry on Day 10.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Following peptide stimulation and feeding with IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, T cells start proliferating. Typically, we observe a reduction in pellet size around day 2–5 of culture, likely due a reduction in non-T cells within PBMCs, followed by an increase in pellet size thereafter. Although the rate of expansion varies between donors, by day 10 the cultures predominantly consist of T cells (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>), which are enriched for antigen-specific T cells of interest. Antigen-specific reactive T cells can be identified by flow cytometric detection of antigen-induced effector cytokine production (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A). As antigen-specific T cell populations reach to sufficient levels detectable by flow cytometry, we typically perform functional analysis on day 10 (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B). Another study that expanded CD8+ T cells from antigen-specific naïve precursors, which utilized a similar culture system involving dendritic cell mobilization prior to peptide stimulation, also found that antigen-specific T cell frequency peaked on day 10 of culture (<a href="#bib7">Lissina et al., 2016</a>). To detect antigen-specific T cells on day 10, we re-stimulate expanded cells with antigens to induce cytokine secretion. We expect that reactive T cells will produce effector cytokines, namely IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2. Reactive T cells typically produce a combination of these cytokines, but it is possible they will produce a single cytokine. Reactive T cells can also be identified using other activation markers, such as CD137, CD154, and CD107a. To ensure that cytokine formation is antigen-specific, we use multiple negative controls. DMSO stimulation serves as the background or non-specific activation control and may be subtracted from test groups to normalize responses across multiple donors. Re-stimulation with irrelevant peptides can serve as a negative control too. Since cells were not expanded with these peptides, detection of irrelevant peptide-specific T cells is not expected. Alternatively, self-peptides, which should not induce immune responses, such as myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), can be utilized. Peptides with known immunogenicity, such as viral epitope pool CEFT, can control for assay conditions and antigen-specific T cell expansion. Additionally, stimulation with PMA and ionomycin can be used to confirm the capacity of T cells to produce effector cytokines and serves as positive control for flow cytometry staining.</p>

<p>(B) Representative results demonstrating detection of reactive T cells following expansion using the described T cell assay protocol. PBMCs from a healthy donor were expanded following stimulation with the vehicle control DMSO, CEFT, which contains known viral epitopes, and test peptides, a pool of five 15mer overlapping peptides spanning mutated SLC35F5 (AKISFFFALCGFWQICHIKKHFQTHKLL) as follows: 1) AKISFFFALCGFWQI, 2) FFFALCGFWQICHIK, 3) LCGFWQICHIKKHFQ, 4) FWQICHIKKHFQTHK, 5) QICHIKKHFQTHKLL (as reported in <a href="#bib10">Roudko et al., 2020</a>). Expanded cells were re-stimulated as indicated with either DMSO, myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), which is a self-protein and used as a negative control, test peptides, CEFT, and PMA/Ionomycin, used as positive controls. Percentage of IFN-γ+ CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry. Data were represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is a highly versatile and scalable T cell assay protocol that can be easily modified to study various aspects of T cell biology. For example, the re-stimulation step enables the testing of T cell cross-reactivity. Moreover, numerous peptides can be tested in the same assay with limited material through the use of pooled peptides followed by deconvolution. The role of checkpoint inhibition can be studied by adding specific blocking antibodies during the initial peptide stimulation (<a href="#bib2">Cimen Bozkus et al., 2019</a>). Similarly, MHC class I and class II blocking antibodies can be utilized by pre-treating cells prior to peptide stimulation. Notably, in addition to expanding memory T cells, this protocol allows priming of naïve T cells (<a href="#bib2">Cimen Bozkus et al., 2019</a>). Therefore, disease-specific antigens, such as neoantigens, can be studied using healthy donor cells without the bias of disease-associated factors such as an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Furthermore, this assay can also be utilized to monitor Th2 and Th17 cell responses, as well as Th1 cells. Finally, in addition to being a beneficial screening tool to evaluate the immunogenicity of antigens and to characterize antigen-specific T cells, this protocol may be modified to yield large scale expansions of reactive T cells under GMP-grade culture conditions, which can be utilized in adoptive T cell therapies.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>FlowJo v10.7.1 was used to analyze flow cytometry data. Reactive T cells were presented as the percentage of CD8+ or CD4+ T cells that express IFN-γ, TNF-α or IL-2. T cells are identified according to the gating strategy shown in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<p>Statistical significance was evaluated using a t test to compare the frequency of T cells that expressed cytokines upon peptide stimulation vs background, no peptide controls. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v9.1.0 and p values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This assay is optimized for the use of peptides while determining antigen-specific T cell responses. If using other sources of antigens, such as full-length proteins, further optimizations will likely be necessary.</p>
<p>As an <i>in vitro</i> assay, this protocol may not reflect the complexity of antigen-presentation and T cell activation that occur <i>in vivo.</i> This assay utilizes external addition of synthetic peptides. Therefore, it relies on cross-presentation to elicit CD8+ T cell responses, whereas <i>in vivo</i> CD8+ T cell responses can also be generated by direct presentation through endogenous route. Moreover, processing of folded full-length proteins and shorter peptide fragments may differ, leading to differential antigen presentation. To overcome these problems, other sources of antigens may be utilized instead of peptides, such as minigenes encoding the antigens of interest.</p>
<p>Since naïve T cell precursors can be primed and activated <i>in vitro</i>, the detection of reactive T cells after expansion does not inform the presence of pre-existing memory responses due to <i>in vivo</i> T cell priming. This could be addressed by setting up the assay with sorted memory and naïve T cell populations instead of PBMCs. We anticipate that while working with memory T cells, shortened culture times may be sufficient to detect reactive T cells.</p>
<p>It is important to consider MHC-restricted antigen recognition while interpreting the immunogenicity of test antigens. Lack of reactive T cells may be due to low binding affinity of the test peptides to the donors’ MHC alleles. It may be necessary to perform MHC allele typing for appropriate selection of donors while testing antigens with known MHC-restrictions. Furthermore, detection of reactive cells may be limited by low precursor T cell frequencies, thereby requiring additional steps to enrich target T cell populations.</p>
<p>Heterogeneity between donors in response to test antigens is commonly observed, likely due to biology as donors have diverse MHC alleles and varying frequencies of precursor T cells and APCs, as well as differences in antigen processing. The biology is further complicated in patients due to the presence of immunosuppressive mechanisms, such as T cell exhaustion and the immune modulatory effects of the treatments they are receiving. Technical factors may also contribute to heterogeneity in response, such as the quality, e.g., viability, of cryopreserved PBMCs upon thawing. Additionally, the timing of each step, especially the expansion and re-stimulation may lead to fluctuations in the percentage of reactive T cells detected.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Insufficient number of PBMCs to test all desired conditions</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Obtaining enough PBMCs to test various peptides may be challenging, especially with the patient samples. In such cases, we recommend stimulating PBMCs with pooled peptides, which can be prepared as an equimolar mixture of desired numbers of peptides. DMSO levels added to the cell culture should be monitored not to exceed 0.1%, especially when pooling many peptides. Pooled peptides can be deconvoluted in the re-stimulation step to evaluate the individual contribution of each peptide to elicited T cell responses, as detailed before step 11.</p>
<p>If the available PBMCs are limited even to test pooled peptides, it is possible to expand APCs and T cells prior to assay start using standard cultures, such as <i>in vitro</i> cultures of hematopoietic stem cells generating high yields of DCs (<a href="#bib1">Balan et al., 2018</a>) and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation and expansion of T cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Inadequate cell numbers after expansion</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There may be several reasons underlying low cell numbers after expansion. 1) The rate of cell expansion varies considerably between different donors. Hence, multiple donors should be tested. 2) Cells may be lost during media exchanges. Noted to be critical after step 8, media removal should be performed carefully to avoid introducing any liquid turbulence. We recommend tilting the plates and slowly aspirating the media from the side of the wells using a multichannel pipette. 3) Excessive cell death may limit the number of live cells. Although we do not typically split the cells during the 10-day culture period, fast growth rates may result in a high cell density leading to increased cell death. In such cases, cells can be split to reduce density. If excessive cell death is observed in the absence of cell growth, cryopreservation methods may need to be optimized. Alternatively, fresh cells may be used. Furthermore, cell death may occur during re-stimulation (steps 13–16), yielding a high dead to live cell ratio. To this end, incubation times following re-stimulation should be optimized by the users. We found that longer incubation times are associated with a greater dead:live cell ratio. Elongated incubations with monensin and BFA can be toxic to cells. It is not recommended to culture cells with these reagents longer than 12 h. If longer incubation times are necessary, monensin and BFA concentrations may be reduced.</p>
<p>If cells did not expand well by day 10, yielding inadequate numbers for downstream functional analysis, the assay can be continued past day 10 with additional feeding steps. Furthermore, instead of 2×10<sup>5</sup> cells per well (step 12), lower numbers, such as 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well, can be seeded for downstream functional analysis. We recommend working with equal numbers of cells between groups for accurate comparisons. Alternatively, ELISpot assays may be performed as they require a smaller number of cells than flow cytometry to analyze effector cytokine formation.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Non-specific background activation</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To eliminate the possibility that cytokine detection in negative control groups is caused by technical issues during flow cytometry analysis, fluorescent minus one (FMO) controls should be utilized, which will help correct compensation-related problems and improve the accuracy of gating to allow successful discrimination of negative and positive populations.</p>
<p>It is possible that the background cytokine detection is not due to technical issues. Although very rarely, we detected cytokine formation by up to 5% of T cells treated with vehicle control. This observation was donor-dependent and in such cases a positive peptide stimulation still yielded significantly greater cytokine formation in test groups compared to the control. As noted after step 9, we recommend avoiding cytokine addition in the last feeding prior to re-stimulation to reduce background activation. We also found that resting cells after harvesting and seeding (steps 11 and 12), prior to re-stimulation, may reduce background activation. Finally, to further minimize background cytokine formation, IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 addition during feedings can be eliminated. Of note, eliminating IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 will reduce growth rates and yield lower total cell numbers at harvest.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Cytokine formation is not detected</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A lack of cytokine detection may be due to that the test peptides are not immunogenic, the donors lack the MHC alleles binding to the antigenic epitopes with high affinity, or the precursor T cells are of low frequency. If the test peptide has a known MHC-restriction, donors should be confirmed to carry the specific MHC allele. For detecting low-level T cell responses, ELISpot assays may perform better than flow cytometry (<a href="#bib5">Karlsson et al., 2003</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>MHC-restriction of immunogenic peptides cannot be determined</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the goal is to identify the restricting MHC alleles for the test peptides, we recommend working with PBMCs from MHC-typed donors. After expansion, tetramer experiments can be conducted to identify the restricting MHCs. Alternatively, at re-stimulation (step 13), instead of directly supplementing peptides, expanded cells can be co-cultured with engineered monoallelic cells that are pulsed with the antigen of interest. <i>In silico</i> MHC-peptide binding affinity predictions can be utilized to narrow down potential MHC-peptide pairs.</p>
