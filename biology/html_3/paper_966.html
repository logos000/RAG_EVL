<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Animal models for MI are useful for studying the pathophysiology and developing therapies. Here, we describe a surgical protocol for permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in mice, which mimics human acute coronary syndrome. This protocol includes descriptive step-by-step surgical procedures and high-quality surgical videos, which are useful for performing stable and highly reproducible operations.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102305">Maruyama et al. (2021)</a></p>

<p>We monitored the heart with cardiac echocardiography in short-and long-axis views before surgery, on postoperative day 2, and every 7 days until 28 days after surgery (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>A and 5B, and <a href="#mmc1">Methods video S3</a>). Left ventricular dimension at end-diastole (LVDd) and end-systole (LVDs) increased after LAD ligation (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). The ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) were decreased (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). These data indicate left ventricular remodeling and subsequent cardiac dysfunction. Additionally, we generated heart sections 28 days after surgery. The sections were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson’s trichrome staining to determine the fibrotic area after LAD ligation (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>D and 5E). In the MI heart, the fibrotic area stained blue with Masson’s trichrome staining was increased compared to sham-operated hearts (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D). The survival probability is shown in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>F.</p>

<p>The extent of fibrosis in sections was quantified as the relative area of positive Masson’s trichrome-stained area (blue fibrosis) normalized to the total section area using ImageJ software. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Mann-Whitney’s <i>u</i>-tests were applied to two-group comparisons. p<i>-</i>values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>LAD ligation is a key determinant of the success and reproducibility of the operation. Collectively, the size of the injured area and survival rate were also highly influenced by the ligation point. For example, it is assumed that if the ligation point is at a higher position, the infarct size will became larger and the mortality rate will increase. This is one of the limitations for beginners. To address this problem, we adapted ECG monitoring and checked ST changes (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>B and 4C), which is useful for confirming the proper ligation. When ST change is not observed in ECG, another ligation should be added adjacent to the position 1–2 mm away from the original ligation point.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Bleeding could be one of the most common causes of death during operation (related to steps 13–29).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To avoid bleeding, you should use blunt-ended instruments when the operation field has low visibility. When there is bleeding, press the bleeding point using rolled Kimwipes.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Pneumothorax is another potential cause of death during or after surgery (related to steps 13–29).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To avoid pneumothorax, you should use blunt-ended instruments as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Operated mice died because of deep anesthesia (related to step 32).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The effective dose and median lethal dose (LD50) of pentobarbital are both around 50 mg/kg of body weight. Therefore, we recommend the use of combined anesthesia with 30 mg pentobarbital /kg of body weight and 1–4% isoflurane. The depth of anesthesia should be adjusted by isoflurane inhalation.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Esophageal intubation is another potential cause of death during surgery due to hypoxia (related to step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To avoid esophageal intubation, you should confirm the epiglottis as a landmark of endotracheal intubation and the thorax movement when you connect the endotracheal intubation tube with the anesthesia apparatus. When the abdomen is swollen, esophageal intubation is highly suspected and you should repeat intubation step.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Lethal arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) are another potential cause of death during or after surgery (related to steps 22–24 and <a href="#limitations">limitations</a> section).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To prevent this problem, it is important to have a fixed place to ligate the LAD coronary artery. Higher point of ligation will lead to larger infarction size and cause lethal arrythmias, which are difficult to deal with when it is happened.</p>
