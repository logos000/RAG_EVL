<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Endothelial tip cells (ETCs) located at growing blood vessels display high morphological dynamics and associated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities with different spatiotemporal patterns during migration. Examining the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and morphological dynamics of ETCs will provide an insight for understanding the mechanism of vascular development in organs, including the brain. Here, we describe a method for simultaneous monitoring and relevant analysis of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and morphology of growing brain ETCs in larval zebrafish.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The expansion of the brain vasculature in zebrafish begins at 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), and becomes robust at 3 dpf, remarkable by numerous growing vessels tipped with endothelial tip cells (ETCs) budding from the choroidal vascular plexus (CVP) located peripherally in the midbrain and migrating into the midbrain. Thus, ETCs budding from the CVP of 3-dpf zebrafish larvae are selected for imaging.</p>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4 days</div>
<p>Double transgenic zebrafish <i>Tg(kdrl:GCaMP5,kdrl:HRAS-mCherry)</i> larvae are used for imaging, in which the GCaMP5 (a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator) and mCherry (a cell membrane-bound red fluorescent protein) are specifically expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) including ETCs, to visualize Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and morphology of ETCs, respectively (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The parental transgenic zebrafish <i>Tg(kdrl:GCaMP5)</i> line was generated by our lab as described in <a href="#bib10">Liu et al. (2020)</a>, and the <i>Tg(kdrl:HRAS-mCherry)</i> line was a gift from Dr. Didier Stainier’s lab (<a href="#bib6">Chi et al., 2008</a>).</p>

<li>Day 1 (0 dpf). Collect fertilized eggs produced and maintain them under a 14 h/10 h light/dark cycle in Hank’s solution (<a href="#bib16">Westerfield, 2000</a>). 6 h later, remove dead eggs and refresh the incubation medium.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The motility of zebrafish larvae at 3 dpf is usually low, making it possible to place free-moving larvae under the microscope for sorting. For zebrafish larvae exhibiting high locomotion activity, the larva should be immobilized with low-melting point agarose beforehand. In addition, when picking up larvae carrying the expression of GCaMP5 and mCherry under the fluorescence microscope, the wide expression of GCaMP5 in endothelial cells of the brain vasculature should be confirmed under both low (10×) and high (40×) magnification fields of view, as the GCaMP5 fluorescence is relatively weak.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Do not use Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS222) for anesthesia in this experiment. The anesthetic effect of MS222 acts through inhibiting the entrance of sodium ions into the cell, thus inhibiting action potentials in neurons (<a href="#bib5">Carter et al., 2011</a>). Previous evidence has shown the expression of sodium channels in ECs and these channels are required for angiogenesis (<a href="#bib2">Andrikopoulos et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib8">Gordienko and Tsukahara, 1994</a>). Furthermore, we found that treatment of MS222 largely affects the morphology of ETCs, with obvious retraction of ETC filopodia and branches.</div>

<li>Immobilize the larvae with 1.2% low-melting point agarose in a self-designed 35-mm plastic dish with a glass coverslip-filled well.

<h3 id="sec3.2">Imaging for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and morphology of ETCs</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3–6 h</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Prepare the Nikon FN1 confocal microscope equipped with a 25× (NA 1.1) or 40× (NA 0.8) water-immersion objective and a heating system with the incubation temperature of 28°C.</li>
<li>Open the NIS-Elements Viewer imaging software, and set parameters for the time-lapse imaging. Use lasers of 488 nm and 561 nm to excite GCaMP5 (for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity) and mCherry (for morphology) of ETCs, respectively.</li>
<li>Identify ETCs for imaging. Place the larva-contained dish under the objective lens of the microscope, find the field of the brain using bright field. Perform a XYZ image of the brain vascular network with GCaMP5 and mCherry at the Z-axis resolution of 4 μm to identify CVP located peripherally in the midbrain. Then identify the ETCs budding from the CVP and extending into the midbrain with several sub-cellular branches and numerous filopodia in the image (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>B and 1C). Finally, move the confocal plane in Z-axis to the identified ETC for the following imaging process.</li>
<li>Perform time-lapse imaging for the selected ETC for 3 – 6 h (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The spatial resolution for images is 0.2–0.4 μm per pixel, the Z-axis resolution is 4 μm, and the interval for Z-projected time-lapse images is ∼ 6 s. During the imaging process, include separated imaging cassettes with time length of 30 min. At the beginning of each imaging cassette, refresh ES solution in the dish through removing old solution and supplementing fresh solution to maintain the larva in a good condition, and reset the bottom-/up- imaging boundary in Z-axis to cover the complete morphology of the ETC.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The interval for Z-projected time-lapse images is an important parameter in this imaging experiment, and too long imaging interval (e.g., larger than half time of the duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients) should be avoided, as it could miss Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients with relative small duration. Based on our imaging data, the average duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ETCs is 40.4 ± 2.3 s. We used the interval of ∼ 6 s in our experiments, which is just enough for capturing Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ETCs. Consistently, <i>Yokota et al</i> used 5 s as the interval for monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations of ECs in larval zebrafish (<a href="#bib14">Yokota et al., 2015</a>). Some ETCs engage the widely distributed morphology in the Z-axis, and more optical sections in Z-axis are required to cover the complete morphology of the ETC, and a longer imaging interval is needed as a result. For this condition, these ETCs should be avoided for imaging.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To avoid large fluctuation of the imaging region in Z-axis during time-lapse imaging, it is important to include separated imaging cassettes according to the imaging time length with reset of bottom-/up- imaging boundary in Z-axis for each imaging cassette.</div>

<li>To correct movement of images within the same time-lapse image series, all images should be aligned with the reference image. Choose one image with obvious Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and relatively least movement at X-Y plane as the reference image in the GCaMP5 image series (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B), then align the analyzed images series with the reference image along X-Y plane using the Translation Transformation plugin (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C).

<li>Iterate the two steps until convergence: first, calculate a smoothed baseline from a baseline set; second, update the baseline set by removing potential Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from the smoothed baseline.

The three parameters in the script can be adjusted if necessary (the baseline smooth window, the number of standard deviation that defines the threshold of potential transients, and the minimal duration that defines the actual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients). In addition, for errors caused by identified artificial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients because of large movements of images instead of actual Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of ETCs, it should be corrected manually in the process of quantification for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, through removing the calculation for these Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients including the area, amplitude, and number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> For the kinetics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ETCs, we collected our imaging data and performed analysis on 79 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of branches from 22 ETCs, and 32 Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients of somata from 11 ETCs. It shows that heterogeneity exist among these Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, with the exhibition of both single-peaked events and accumulated-fired multiple-peaked events (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A). To further analyze the timing property of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ETCs, including the duration, rise time, and decay time of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in branches or somata of ETCs, we generated a MATLAB script for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients fitting via modeling the rise and decay phases of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients as linear and exponential, respectively. Through defining the threshold as 90% decay of the peak of the fitted Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, the duration (with ΔR/R<sub>0</sub> above the threshold), rise time (time between the threshold and the peak in the rise phase), and decay time (time between the threshold and the peak in the decay phase) were then calculated (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B). For the duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, it shows no significant difference between the branches and somata of ETCs (branch versus soma, 40.3 ± 2.6 s versus 40.5 ± 4.9 s, p = 0.6, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Furthermore, there is no significant difference for the rise and decay time between the branches and somata of ETCs, respectively (rise time, branch versus soma, 16.0 ± 1.5 s versus 15.5 ± 2.3 s, p = 0.6; decay time, branch versus soma, 24.3 ± 2.0 s versus 25.0 ± 3.6 s, p = 0.2, two-tailed Mann-Whitney test). Meanwhile, the rise time is significantly shorter than the decay time of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in both branches and somata of ETCs (branch, rise versus decay, 16.0 ± 1.5 s versus 24.3 ± 2.0 s, p &lt; 0.0001; soma, rise versus decay, 15.5 ± 2.3 s versus 25.0 ± 3.6 s, p = 0.01; two-tailed Mann-Whitney test) (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B).</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol demonstrates a feasible method for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and morphology imaging of ETCs in larval zebrafish. This method enables us to have an in-depth understanding on ETC behaviors via combining the spatiotemporal pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in ETCs (e.g., global/sub-cellular local Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities and relative high-frequency/low-frequency/silent Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities) (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a> and <a href="#fig3">3</a>B), and the growing state of ETCs (e.g., retraction/extension of ETC branches or filopodia, growing path selection of ETCs, or fusion between ETCs and targeting vessels) in intact larval zebrafish (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Furthermore, using Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities and morphological dynamics of ETCs as a readout, we are able to explore the involved regulation mechanism of ETC growth by intrinsic/extrinsic chemical or mechanical signals during vascular development.</p>
<p>For the source machinery of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities, both extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> store contributes to the generation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and these two components can further interact to amplify the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<a href="#bib3">Berridge et al, 2003</a>). For example, the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> store opening mediated by inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are sensitive to the concentration of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and they are identified to release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum/sarcoplasmic reticulum in a bell-shaped Ca<sup>2+</sup>-response in response to the concentration of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href="#bib4">Bezprozvanny et al., 1991</a>). Relative low concentration of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> at nanomolar promotes the opening of IP3Rs and RyRs, leading to further increased content of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is the process known as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-store release. However, with the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevates, the relative high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at micromolar instead inhibits the opening of IP3Rs and RyRs. On the other hand, the emptying Ca<sup>2+</sup> store activates the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to replenish Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the endoplasmic reticulum, a process known as store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) (<a href="#bib11">Oike et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#bib15">Vaca and Kunze, 1994</a>). In endothelial cells, it has been reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-store release and SOCE are required for the regulation of endothelial permeability or proliferation (<a href="#bib1">Abdullaev et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib11">Oike et al., 1994</a>; <a href="#bib13">Sun et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib15">Vaca and Kunze, 1994</a>), further some Ca<sup>2+</sup>store-related channels or transmembrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum are identified for the regulation of EC migration during vascular morphogenesis (e.g., two-pore channels, TMEM33) (<a href="#bib7">Favia et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib12">Savage et al., 2019</a>). In parallel, previous study has shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in ECs is required for EC proliferation or vessel invasion (<a href="#bib9">Kohn et al., 1995</a>), and our previous evidence also shows that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in ETCs mediated by the mechanosensitive cationic channel Piezo1 plays a crucial role in vascular pathfinding (<a href="#bib10">Liu et al., 2020</a>). For the future study, it is intriguing to investigate the working mechanism and integration machinery of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> components inside ETCs in response to various upstream inputs during vascular development.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol is applicable for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of ETCs with morphology mainly distributed in the X-Y plane due to the scan speed limitation. For ETCs with very long growing path and large sub-cellular branches/filopodia expending along the Z plane, the coverage of relatively increased number of frames spanned in the Z-axis may sacrifice the interval of time-lapse images to some extent for the current microscope parameters, thus optimized equipment setup for the confocal microscopy or the light-sheet imaging should be alternatively used.</p>
<p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP5 of the transgenic zebrafish <i>Tg(kdrl:GCaMP5)</i> line used in this protocol is expressed in ETCs, including the soma and branches. We did not find the expression of GCaMP5 in the filopodia of ETCs, neither Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity inside. For monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the filopodia of ETCs in larval zebrafish, other optimized transgenic lines for GCaMPs should be used. For this purpose, we tried the GCaMP6s indicator expressed in ECs of the transgenic <i>Tg(kdrl:GCaMP6s-CAAX)</i> zebrafish larvae, and found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients occurring in both filopodia and the mother branch of ETCs could be visualized when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are relative strong.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Poor fertilized egg production (production and maintenance of transgenic zebrafish larvae, step 2)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To get enough fertilized egg for the imaging experiment, the healthy state of adult male and female parental fish should be considered. Usually adult fish with the age younger than 2 years are used for egg production. Furthermore, to maintain a stable egg-producing ability of the adult fish, it is helpful to regularly mate the adult fish with the wild type fish (e.g., every 3 months). Alternatively, artificial insemination for adult fish could be used, while it may lead to disturbed healthy state for the adult fish.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>For one batch of harvested zebrafish larvae used for imaging, some larvae display malformation or hemorrhage in the brain (production and maintenance of transgenic zebrafish larvae, steps 3–5).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Embryonic malformation or hemorrhage may happen with handling problems when transferring the larvae during maintaining. Always transfer the larvae gently using an appropriate clean and soft plastic straw with a smooth tip surface to avoid injury for the skin tissue of larvae. A new batch of larvae should be prepared if the percentage of malformation is relatively high.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Blood flow and heart beating of the imaged zebrafish larvae drop in the speed during the imaging process (imaging for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and morphology of ETCs, step 5).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>For long-term imaging on immobilized zebrafish larvae, the stress caused by accumulated metabolic waste and growing body-produced mechanical restriction may affect the healthy state of the larva and further the growing state of ETCs. To avoid this problem during imaging, it is helpful to keep an appropriate concentration of the lowing-melting point agarose (1.2%) when immobilizing the larvae, remove the agarose around the mouth and tail of the imaged larva to leave free space for growing, maintain an appropriate incubation temperature (28°C) for the larvae, and refresh the incubation medium every 30 min.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>How to correct the motion artifacts at the X-Y plane in the image series (analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data, step 6b)?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To correct motion artifacts at the X-Y plane within the same time-lapse image series, we align the image series with the selected reference image along X-Y plane using the Translation Transformation plugin in ImageJ (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>B and 2C). The reference image selected within the image series should display obvious Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and relatively least movement at X-Y plane in the GCaMP5 series. For the selection of mCherry reference images, the image with the same sequential number with the GcaMP5 reference image should be used in the same time-lapse image series. For large motion artifact in the image series that cannot be corrected using the alignment procedure, we usually remove the largely moved images before analysis or remove data points of these images plotted in the ΔR/R<sub>0</sub> dataset. On the other hand, our ratiometric analysis method using the fluorescence ratio of GcaMP5 to mCherry for ΔR/R<sub>0</sub> calculation helps to reduce the effects of motion artifacts, as the mCherry fluorescence also serves as a reference signal for GcaMP5 besides as a morphological indicator of ETCs.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Fluorophore bleaching of images occurred in the long-term confocal imaging experiment (imaging for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and morphology of ETCs, step 5).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Based on our experience, the problem of fluorophore bleaching could be avoided through optimized laser scanning parameters. We usually capture images with spatial resolution of 0.2 – 0.4 μm per pixel, which is enough for achieving clear morphology of ETCs, including the branches and filopodia. When capturing images using the confocal microscope, on the basis of ensuring acceptable spatial resolution of the images, it is helpful to avoid the bleaching problem through appropriately (1) increasing the pinhole size and voltage of the photomultiplier tube (PMT); (2) decreasing the laser power/intensity, laser pixel dwell time, and scan magnification. In addition, it also helps to save the scan time for 3-dimensional time-lapse imaging through reducing the range of captured fields via the “crop” element in the imaging software combining with relative low scan magnification.</p>
<p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data contains obvious fluorophore bleaching, the declining tendency in Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> – Time (s)) could be corrected via applying adaptive F<sub>0</sub> values corresponding to each data point at each time point. In this protocol, our Ca<sup>2+</sup> analysis script for excluding fluctuations in the baseline could overcome the problem in Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace caused by fluorophore bleaching.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Artificial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are included in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace during analysis (analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data, step 7).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>For dataset containing sharp fluctuations in the baseline, the sharp fluctuations may be misclassified as Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients by the script. To overcome this problem, dataset before and after the sharp fluctuation point of baseline should be separately analyzed. In addition, it is always recommended to perform Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity analysis with this program using separated dataset cassettes according to the time length of the time-lapse dataset (e.g., for 10 – 30 min), as small cassette makes it more reliable to discriminate data points in the baseline or in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the dataset, and easier to visually confirm the final-baseline removed Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace and quantified Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Finally, errors in identified Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients because of large movements of images rather than Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity of ETCs should be corrected manually.</p>
