<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We recently established an <i>in vitro</i> culture system in which mammary gland organoid undergoes directional migration in response to an FGF10 concentration gradient. Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol for preparing organoids, the setup of the 3D culture system, and the image acquisition approach. The technical difficulties in conducting the 3D migration assay are choosing epithelial organoids of appropriate sizes and manually paring organoids and beads pre-soaked in FGF10 within a desirable distance (∼100 μm).</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108246">Lu et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>Increasing evidence shows that vertebrate epithelia are more motile than historically believed. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which vertebrate epithelia migrate is essential for understanding organ development and etiologies that cause disease conditions. We recently established a culture system in which mammary gland organoid undergoes directional migration (<a href="#bib2">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>) (<a href="#bib3">Zhang et al., 2014b</a>) (<a href="#bib1">Lu et al., 2020</a>). Here, we present a detailed protocol that tackles several challenging aspects of the technique so that the assay can be reliably and successfully conducted by scientists not familiar with the system.</p>
<p>Because of Matrigel’s unique physical properties, where it is liquid at ∼ 4°C–10˚C but solidifies once it is warmed up to the room temperature, one must work relatively fast and be able to complete pairing epithelial organoids and beads before Matrigel solidifies. This requires that the experimenters be familiar with the protocol and have all the reagents prepared in advance before the day of the experiment.</p>
<ol>
<li>Soak heparin beads with FGF10
<ol type="a">
<li>Prepare reference beads Reference beads serve two purposes: first, they assist the experimenters in choosing beads of relatively uniform sizes, which, at least in theory, can pre-soak a similar amount of FGF10 proteins; second, they help the experimenters readily determine under the stereoscope the distance between the FGF10-beads and organoids, and the FGF10 concentration gradient hereby created, and help keep the distances relatively uniform between each bead-organoid pair.
<ol type="i">
<li>Transfer 20 μL beads into a 35 mm tissue culture dish containing 2 mL of PBS.</li>
<li>Pick several beads (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B) of different sizes and put them in a 96-well culture plate containing 100 μL of PBS per well, and limit one bead in each well.

</li>
<li>Take pictures and check the size of each bead under a microscope.</li>
<li>Transfer two beads, one 100 μm and the other 150 μm in diameter, into a 35 mm dish containing 2 mL of PBS (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>D and 1D′).</li>
<li>Seal the dish with parafilm (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E). These two beads will be used as references for checking the sizes and distances of beads and organoids.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The beads are stored in a 50% slurry. Thus, 20 μL of slurry contains ∼ 10 μL of beads and ∼ 10 μL of PBS. Mix the tube first before transferring the mixture. Three brands of heparin beads have been compared (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>A–1A’’). In our hands, there are no noticeable differences when they are used to stimulate organoid migration. We prefer using the Sigma beads (Sigma, #H5263, <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A) because they are opaque and more noticeable than the other two brands, both of which are transparent. However, the sigma beads have been discontinued. The zoom knob was set at 3 for all steps (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C).</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Pick the beads between 100 - 150 μm in diameter, based on their comparison with the reference beads, under a stereo microscope. Use a tally counter to count the number of beads that you will have.</li>
<li>Soak the picked beads with FGF10
<ol type="i">
<li>Transfer ∼ 30 beads (&lt;40 beads so that each has been saturated by FGF10 proteins after soaking) into a 0.2 mL tube.</li>
<li>Add 200 μL of 0.1% BSA in PBS (see recipe in <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>), mix gently, and then spin briefly.</li>
<li>Remove supernatant, add 10 μL of FGF10 stock solution (see recipe in <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>), rotate at 18 rpm at 4°C overnight on a rocker (Kylin-Bell, BE-1100) (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>H). The beads should be used within one week.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The unused beads can be saved in 200 μL of 0.1% BSA in PBS in a 35 mm dish or a 0.2 mL tube, and stored at 4°C up to a week without a noticeable decrease in performance.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure that there is no liquid on the tube wall to ensure that the beads are suspended in the liquid while on the rocker (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>F–1H).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Rather than weigh collagenase and take a small amount (0.02 g) each time, we find it is more convenient to weigh it once and store multiple aliquots (0.02 g/tube) at −20°C until future use.</li>
<li>The day before or on the day of the experiment, warm 9.3 mL of DMEM/F12 medium in a tissue culture incubator or a 37°C water bath to make the collagenase digestion solution.</li>
<li>Place Matrigel in the refrigerator one night ahead so that it thaws overnight.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, thaw the Matrigel on the day of the experiment in a 4°C–10°C water bath or running tap water. However, once melted, Matrigel should be put on the ice so that it does not solidify as it would when over-heated to the RT.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Prepare two fine needles for pairing organoids and beads: first, break a 10 cm capillary tube in the middle. Use a Bunsen burner to seal the sharp end. Then apply one drop of superglue to the open end of the broken capillary tube, to which insert an insect pin. Leave the needle on the benchtop one day for the glue to dry (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>I). Needles can be stored in 75% EtOH and washed in cold PBS before use.</li>
<li>Make sure that there are enough reagents listed in the <a href="#key-resources-table">key resource table</a> for the experiments.</li>

<div class="timing">

<p>Preparation of properly-sized organoids.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, this migration assay works the best when the size of the organoids is between 100 and 200 μm. Mincing of mammary glands (MGs) at around 300–400 times per mouse is optimal for getting enough properly-sized organoids. Moreover, minimizing the number of dead cells and maximizing the vitality of the organoids is essential for the success of the migration assay. Thus, the entire organoid preparation procedures, which are shortened when compared to the most commonly used organoid preparation protocols, need to complete as fast as one possibly can.</p>
<ol>
<li>To harvest mammary glands, first put two 10 cm Petri dishes and surgery tools on the surgery table and turn on the dry glass bead sterilizer.</li>
<li>Turn on 37°C heat block and 37°C shaker in tissue culture room.</li>
<li>Warm-up DMEM/F12 bottle to room temperature in tissue culture hood.</li>
<li>Prepare collagenase digestion solution:</li>
</ol>
<p>Add 0.02 g collagenase to a 15 mL tube containing warm 9.3 mL of DMEM/F12, and put it on a 37°C shaker.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Before mincing the mammary glands: add 0.5 mL of FBS, 200 μL of 100 mg/mL trypsin, 10 μL of 50 mg/mL gentamicin, 25 μL of 2 mg/mL insulin. Sterilize the solution by running it through a 0.22 μm vacuum filter.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Collagenase does not dissolve well. So add it to the medium early to allow more time for it to dissolve. Add the trypsin stock solution last, i.e., right before the filtration step, to minimize collagenase digestion by trypsin. Collagenase digestion solution should be freshly prepared each time.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Prepare to harvest the MGs from a mature virgin female mouse of 6–10 weeks of age.<br> Sterile techniques should be used on an open bench during mammary gland harvest.
<ol type="a">
<li>Wipe down the dissection station with 70% ethanol.</li>
<li>Disinfect the dissecting tools by heat in a glass bead sterilizer at 280°C for 1 min. Cool the surgical tools on an open Petri dish.</li>
<li>Sterilize all the surgical supplies, a surgical board (a Styrofoam board covered in an aluminum foil ), and pins with 70% alcohol. Use sterilized cotton swabs during mammary gland harvest.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Euthanize the mouse in a CO<sub>2</sub>-saturated chamber for 3–5 min, followed by cervical dislocation.</li>
<li>With the carcass on its back, pin it to the surgical board. Then spray with 70% ethanol until the fur is soaking wet.</li>
<li>To harvest the #3, 4, and 5 MGs from the mouse, identify the midline between the two hind legs. Pinch a small piece of the skin with a tweezer (JZ, Cat# JD1080), and make a small incision on the abdominal skin with sharp scissors (SCRC, Cat# 92360147), then extend the cut along the ventral midline up to the neck (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>A and 2B). Be careful to cut only the skin and not the peritoneum underneath.

<p>(E) Use scissors and tweezers to remove gland #5 below the thigh. The solid yellow line represents the approximate area of gland #5.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Extend the cuts laterally towards the legs and arms. Use the tweezer and a cotton swab to release the skin from the peritoneum. Pull the skin away and stretch it tight before pinning it down (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B'). Remove the lymph nodes (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C) located at the intersection of three blood vessels in gland #4 (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C'). Then harvest the remaining #4 MGs similarly as the #5 MGs using forceps (JZ, Cat# JD1050) and scissors to grasp and cut them from the skin (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>E). For harvesting the #3 MGs (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D), pull up a thin layer of muscle located on top of gland #3 to expose the mammary gland (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D’), and use a cotton swab to push the #3 MG together (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D''). This will reduce the contamination by muscle tissue.</li>
<li>Collect and pool the MG tissues on the lid of a Petri dish (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A). The edge of the lid is shallow, thus making the tissues more accessible to the blades and easy to mince.</li>
<li>Bring the dissected MG tissue to a tissue culture hood.</li>
<li>Prepare collagenase solution as mentioned in step 4.</li>
<li>Mince the glands in the Petri dish lid using two surgical blades (Jinhuan, surgical blade #22, Cat# V500620, scalpel knife handle, Cat# K6-20). Rotate the lid after mincing every ten times so that the tissues will be chopped again in a different orientation. The MGs will have been finely minced after chopping with two scalpels for ∼300–400 times per mouse (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A′).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The mincing conditions have been optimized for this assay. For harvesting organoids, fibroblast cells for FGF2 induced branching assay, chopping should be less than 120 times. If over-chopped or under-chopped, the organoids might be too small or too big, either of which will negatively affect the performance of the assay.</div>
<ol start="14">
<li>Transfer the minced tissue into the collagenase solution, mix well (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B). Place it horizontally in a 37°C shaker to ensure even mixing. Shake for 22 min.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> While waiting for digestion, warm 4 mL of the medium for the DNase solution (see recipe in <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>). Coat the inner surfaces of a 15 mL tube (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A) and two 35 mm dishes (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B) with 2.5% BSA (see recipe in <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>). Without the coating, organoids tend to stick on the plastic surfaces. So all serological pipettes (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D) and pipette tips (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C) must be coated with the BSA solution. To coat the tubes, mix BSA solution thoroughly to cover the inner walls, then it can be removed. A short coating with BSA works well enough, though more prolonged exposure does not seem to pose adverse effects either.</div>

<p>Pairing organoids with FGF10-coated beads.</p>
<p>Manually juxtapose the organoids with the FGF10-coated beads under a stereo microscope. The goal is to arrange five pairs in each well.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>Wash FGF10-coated beads three times with 0.1% BSA in PBS, 200 μL per wash, spin 15 s on a mini centrifuge. Transfer washed beads into a 35 mm dish containing 2 mL of 0.1% BSA in PBS. Let the samples sit on ice.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="24">
<li>Juxtapose a bead with an organoid in 80% Matrigel (see recipe in <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Before starting the experiment, prepare the working station (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>A and 5B).</div>
Before handling the Matrigel, pipette tips should be cooled by soaking in ice-cold PBS for 20 s. Before handling organoids, pipette tips should be coated with 2.5% BSA in PBS.<br> Both 60% and 80% Matrigel works for this assay. However, in 60% Matrigel, there is a higher chance that the organoid may settle and touch the glass bottom, at which point it will spread on the bottom surface rather than directionally migrate toward FGF10 beads. This assay is sensitive to Matrigel concentration. When the concentration of Matrigel is too high, organoid migration may be hindered.<br> When opening a new vial of Matrigel, record the concentration of the gel. The Matrigel protein concentration between 5.7 mg/mL to 7.6 mg/mL works well for this assay. The calculation is based on the protein concentration of different lot numbers provided by the manufacturer.

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The proper size is about 50 μm diameter × 100–200 μm length (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>F, 4G, and 4G′). When an organoid length is less than 50 μm, its morphology tends to look defective. Organoids first undergo a sealing process to form a cyst (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B’). If the organoid length is longer than 200 μm, the area center of the cyst will be more than 150 μm away from the bead. Such organoids often respond poorly to FGF10 stimulation and do not migrate well toward the bead.</div>

Different lot numbers of Matrigel might have different concentrations of protein. This will also influence the gel stability in the PFA solution.

The magnification is 40×. Image resolution is 1,024 × 1,024 square pixels, with a calibration factor 0.098 μm/pixel (<a href="#fig7">Figures 7</a>C and 7D), 0.117 μm/pixel (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>C’), and 0.125 μm/pixel (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>D’). Red-green-blue (RGB) images can be assembled using Fiji software (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>H, <a href="#fig7">7</a>C, 7C′, 7D, and 7D′). For imaging CD49f, a laser line with a 631 nm of wavelength, 32% of intensity, 132% of HyD detector gain is used, and the image processing threshold range is 200–2000. For imaging SMA, a laser line with a 498 nm of wavelength, 2% of intensity, 146% of HyD detector gain is used, and image processing threshold range is 100–3000. For imaging DAPI, a laser line with a 405 nm of wavelength, 4% of intensity, 100% of HyD detector gain, and image processing threshold range is 100–3000.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Heparan beads pre-soaked in FGF10 but not in bovine serum albumin attracted organoid migration (<a href="#fig7">Figures 7</a>A’’’ and 7B’’’). The organoid first underwent a sealing process to form a cyst (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B'). By the time the organoid was about to migrate at ∼36 h, the side of the organoid closer to the FGF10 bead, which we refer to as the “organoid front,” was noticeably thicker than the opposite, or rear, side (<a href="#fig7">Figures 7</a>B'', 7C', and 7D′). Directional migration from FGF10 stimulation is a multi-stage process by which a simple epithelium forms a polarized cyst, which then undergoes epithelial sealing, differential cell proliferation and stratification, and subsequent migration (<a href="#bib1">Lu et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>One limitation of the current protocol is that it has only been optimized for mammary gland epithelium, and not for other vertebrate epithelia. Conditions, e.g., growth factors used, will need to be changed/optimized depending on the epithelia of interest.</p>
<p>Likewise, another limitation is that the heparin beads, which are useful for soaking and then delivering FGF10, might not be suitable for other growth factors. Users will need to find the best method to deliver their proteins/growth factors of interest.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Organoid floating on the Matrigel, at step 24: i.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When pairing organoids with beads, if organoids are found floating on Matrigel’s surface, use a fine needle to gently push them into the gel. Once they enter the Matrigel, they will slowly sink to the bottom.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>It is challenging to manually arrange the distance of 100 μm between beads and organoids, at step 24: i.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, to determine the distance under a stereo microscope relatively accurately, a reference bead of 100 μm in diameter is required (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D, D' and E). A distance less than 100 μm but greater than 50 μm between the bead and the organoid is acceptable. Furthermore, try to keep the beads and organoids in as the middle of the Matrigel drop and away from the edges as possible. The length from the first pair to the fifth pair should be half of the diameter of the entire coating gel (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>E). Finally, each organoid-bead pair should be at least 300 μm apart to minimize the impact between each pair.</p>
<p>When using the needle to adjust the bead and organoids in the Matrigel, the needle does not need to touch them directly. Let the needle flick the Matrigel that is directly above or by the side of the bead or organoid. If the needle touches them directly, it tends to scratch the solidifying coating gel or the organoids and cause unnecessary damages to them. Practice will until you are skilled at these manual operations. Start from working one well each time. Once you are familiar with the procedure, then you can start working on four wells each time.</p>
<p>If the room temperature is higher than 25 Celsius or the operation time is too long, Matrigel will solidify. If the bead or organoid cannot be pushed around in Matrigel, it is because the gel has solidified. If so, discard this well and start over.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Beads and organoids are initially well arranged, but become scattered or misarranged once the Matrigel has solidified, at step 24: m.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This annoyance could happen when working with multiple wells of samples at once. Any vibrations to the wells could cause the samples to move and become misarranged in the unsolidified Matrigel. When moving the icebox and the 24-well plate together, the black disk on the stereo microscope might interfere with smooth movement (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5D'</a>). Thus, we find it helpful to remove the black disk when working with the icebox (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>D'' and 5D’’’). Moreover, water condensation on the cold block could also cause noticeable vibrations when moving the 24-well plate. Wipe clean any water condensation before putting the 24-well plate on the block (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>E and 5E′).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Organoids touch the glass bottom of the culture plate, at step 26.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the coating gel is not well solidified, the organoid will tend to touch the culture plate bottom, which causes the organoid to spread, rather than to directionally migration. If the ambient temperature is lower than 20<sup>o</sup>C, the step of placing the plate on a cold block for 1 min can be omitted (step 24: b, <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>B).</p>
<p>Alternatively, leave the coated plate on the 37°C heat block for up to 3 min. Be careful, however, that leaving it on the heat block for too long may cause excessive drying of the gel, thus changing gel concentration and compromise organoid migration.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Organoids do not migrate towards FGF10-coated beads, at steps 26 and 27.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, the organoids should not be too big or too small. Their lengths, when derived from mammary gland ductal epithelium, should be between 100 to 200 μm. Second, the organoid front, which refers to the side closer to the FGF10 bead, should be 50–100 μm apart from the bead. This means that the area center of the organoid should be 100–150 μm apart from the bead. Third, multiple (three to five) pairs of juxtaposed organoid-bead should be used to determine the migration efficiency. If the above conditions have all been met, but the conclusion still is that there is no migration, then the possible solution is to look at the critical reagents one by one, especially the Matrigel and FGF10.</p>
<p>Regarding Matrigel, make sure you know the lot# of the Matrigel and that it has been stored at -20°C. Moreover, the freeze-thaw cycle of leftover Matrigel should be less than five times. According to the experimental requirements, usually the aliquot volume of Matrigel is 250 or 500 μL per tube. It is best to use the newly aliquoted Matrigel when performing the 3D migration assay for the first time, which will reduce the difficulty of troubleshooting. We only used Corning's Matrigel (Corning, Cat#354230) in this experiment and haven't tried any other company's basement membrane extracts. When you use other company's products, it is a good practice to use Corning's Matrigel as a positive control to ensure that other brands can provide the same migration results.</p>
<p>Regarding FGF10, buying a large quantity of FGF10 is not recommended. Store lyophilized FGF10 at −80°C until use. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to reconstitute it. Make small aliquots, 5 or 10 μL per tube, so that one aliquot is used up each time if possible. Store at −80°C. Upon reconstitution, the aliquots should be used within six months. We have compared FGF10 provided by different manufacturers and have found that rmFGF10 (GenScript, Cat#Z03155) worked well.</p>
<p>Organoids should be used within 7 h. For a skilled experimenter, it usually takes 1.5 h to arrange a well containing five organoid-bead pairs. Most of the steps of this protocol have been optimized, although we recognize there is still room for improvement.</p>
