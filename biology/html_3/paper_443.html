<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Auto <i>in silico</i> ligand directing evolution (AILDE) is an effective approach to rapidly explore the structure-activity relationship for H2L optimization (<a href="#bib11">Wu et al., 2020</a>). AILDE is utilized to optimize a hit compound by minor chemical modifications on its scaffold. Minimal increases or losses for the binding efficiency of ligand could be obtained by these modifications. Hence, this method can help us for the exploration of the chemical space around a hit compound and promote the optimization of the hit compound into more drug-like lead compounds. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows the workflow of AILDE. AILDE is based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation complemented with one-step free energy perturbation (FEP) (<a href="#bib2">Hao et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib10">Wu et al., 2018</a>). MD simulation is firstly performed on the protein-hit complex. The equilibrated conformational ensemble is then collected. The hit ligand in each conformation is modified to new ligand with substitution using the fragment library. The binding free energy changes between protein-hit and hit analogs are calculated. New leads are finally determined based on the rank of the binding affinity changes.</p>
<figure id="fig1"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/443-Fig1.jpg" alt="Fig1.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Workflow of the AILDE method</div>
<p>Once an initial protein-hit complex structure is provided, AILDE will conduct the hit-to-lead optimization according to the following steps: (1) molecular dynamics simulation: this allow to simulate the structural flexibility of the protein-hit complex; (2) collecting the conformational ensemble: adequately collect the representative conformations of a protein-hit complex; (3) generating the hit analogues: a fragment growing based method is utilized to convert a hit to analogue compounds. The conformations of protein-analogues complex are obtained from the representative conformations of the protein-hit complex; (4) binding free energy change: comparing the binding free energy of protein-hit and protein-analogues complexes. Identifying the potential lead compounds according to the rank of the binding free energy changes.</p>

<p>We should provide a productive computational environment for the usage of AILDE. We need a high performance computer with a Unix-based operating system to perform this protocol. A graphics processing unit (GPU) equipment is advised to be used to accelerate the process of molecular dynamics simulation. The prerequisite software (in the <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section) is freely available on the corresponding websites. The detail introduction about the installation is provided in their user manuals. These software are utilized in different procedures. We download the source code of AILDE at <a href="https://github.com/fwangccnu/AILDE">https://github.com/fwangccnu/AILDE</a>. After configuration of the computational environment, we prepare the input data according to the following steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the structure file of our interest protein complex with a hit ligand from RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) (<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">https://www.rcsb.org/</a>). For example, search the PDB ID of 2P3B in PDB database, and obtain the result of the crystal structure of the subtype B wild type HIV protease complexes with TL-3 inhibitor. And save the PDB format structure file.</li>
<li>Open the structure file by Chimera software, keep the hit ligand and its direct interacting protein chain and delete all the irrelative molecules, and save as a processed PDB format structure file. <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A shows the example of deleting the irrelative atoms by Chimera software.

<h3 id="sec3.1">A fragment library construction</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼3 h</div>
<ol>
<li>Create the three-dimensional structures of all fragments by Chimera software (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). The fragments are used to link with the hit compound to generate the hit analogs (<a href="#bib3">Hoffer et al., 2018</a>). All the hydrogen atoms should be deleted in the fragment molecules, except the hydrogen atoms located at the linking point.

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 3. Construction of stereoscopic conformation of a fragment molecule</div>
<p>The Build Structure module in Chimera provides several ways to manipulate a molecular structure. This snapshot shows the procedure for building a benzene molecule.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the fixed format of a PDB file, it is easy to do these by the scripts in batch mode. We can delete all the hydrogen atoms in a PDB file except the linking point of a hydrogen atom (serial number: <i>id</i>) by a line of bash command:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>awk '{if ($NF == "H" &amp;&amp; $2 != id) {} else {print}}' fragment_H.pdb &gt; fragment_noH.pdb</li>
</ul>
<p>where <i>id</i> is the serial number of a hydrogen atom as the linking point, <i>fragment_H.pdb</i> is the pdb file of a fragment molecule with all hydrogen atoms, <i>fragment_noH.pdb</i> is the fragment molecule with only a hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>For a large number of fragments, we just need to use the loop function to deal with each individual repeatedly:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>for i in $(ls ∗.pdb)</li>
<li>do
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>fragname=$(basename ${i} .pdb)</li>
<li>for j in $( awk '{if ($NF == "H") {print $2}}' ${i})</li>
<li>do
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>awk '{if ($NF == "H" &amp;&amp; $2 != “‘${j}’”) {} else {print}}' ${i} &gt; ${fragname}_${j}.pdb</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>done</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>done</li>
</ul>
<p>We can save the above bash codes in a text file (for example: a file named <i>del_H.sh</i>) in the same directory as the fragment PDB files. And run the scripts by type the following in the command line:</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>bash del_H.sh</li>
</ul>
<p>The processed PDB files of fragments are generated in the directory.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.3">Molecular dynamics simulation of the protein-hit complex</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼3 h</div>
<p>In this stage, conformational sampling on the protein complex with hit ligand is conducted by molecular dynamics simulation (<a href="#bib5">Maximova et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>The topology and coordinate file for the solvated protein-hit complex is generated by <i>tleap</i> module in Amber program. Protein was parameterized by Amber ff14SB force filed and the hit compound molecule by the general Amber force field (GAFF). AM1-BCC charge was assigned for the hit compound by <i>antechamber</i> module in Amber. The complex system was then solvated in the cube box of the TIP3P water model with a distance of 10 Å between the solute and box. The counter-ions (Cl<sup>−</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>) were then added to neutralize the solvated protein-hit system.</li>
<li>Three cycles of energy minimization are performed on the system by <i>sander</i> module in Amber program. Each cycle includes 5,000 steps of steepest descent, followed by 5,000 steps of conjugated gradient minimization with a final convergence criterion of 0.2 kcal∙mol<sup>−1</sup>. The following shows a brief description about three cycles of energy minimization:
<ol type="a">
<li>Cycle 1: the heavy atoms in protein and hit compound are restrained with an elastic constant of 50 kcal∙mol<sup>−1</sup>∙Å<sup>−2</sup>. The water molecules, ions, and hydrogen atoms are allowed to move for relaxation.</li>
<li>Cycle 2: protein side-chains are also allowed to relax in this step. Only the heavy atoms in the backbone of the protein are restrained with an elastic constant of 50 kcal∙mol<sup>−1</sup>∙Å<sup>−2</sup>.</li>
<li>Cycle 3: the whole system is minimized.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Molecular dynamics simulation is then performed on the protein-hit complex with the periodic boundary condition in the NPT ensemble. The detail steps are described as the following:
<ol type="a">
<li>The solvated system is heated gradually from 0 to 298 K in the NVT ensemble during a period of 500 ps.</li>
<li>The heated system is equilibrated in the NPT ensemble during a period of 1 ns.</li>
<li>Production simulation at the temperature of 298 K and the pressure of 1 atm. The SHAKE algorithm is used to constrain all covalent bonds involving hydrogens. The particle mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm is used to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions and the short-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions is handled with a cutoff distance of 10 Å. The integration of the equations of motion is conducted at a time step of 2 fs. Finally, 1 ns production simulation is performed and the structure snapshots are collected every 1 ps (<a href="#sec6.3">Troubleshooting 2</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The fluctuations of the protein and hit compound are measured by root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) against their initial structures. The stability of the MD simulation is reflected by their RMSD values, which reveal the conformational changes during the time period of MD simulation. A plateau RMSD value means that the protein-hit complex is in the equilibration state, and that the simulation moves toward the stability status.</li>

<li>When the parameter “md_request” is set to “NO,” structural relaxation without molecular dynamics simulation will be performed. First, all the backbone atoms of protein and the ligand are restrained with an elastic constant of 50 kcal∙mol<sup>−1</sup>∙Å<sup>−2</sup>. Then the whole system is minimized. Each of the two minimization steps includes 5,000 cycles of steepest descent and 5,000 cycles of conjugated gradient optimization with a convergence criterion of 0.2 kcal∙mol<sup>−1</sup>.</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼2 h</div>
<p>In this stage, we calculate the binding affinity (ΔG<sub>bind</sub>) of protein-hit and protein-analogs complexes, then compare the differences of binding free energy change (ΔΔG) between protein-hit and protein-analogs complexes.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>The binding affinity ΔG<sub>bind</sub> can be decomposed into three main energy terms, including the molecular mechanical gas-phase interaction energy (ΔE<sub>MM</sub>), desolvation energy (ΔG<sub>sol</sub>) and the change of conformational entropy (–TΔS). ΔE<sub>MM</sub> and ΔG<sub>sol</sub> are calculated by the MMPBSA module in Amber program. –TΔS is calculated using our in-house scripts. The entropy contribution is temperature-dependent and can be divided to two contributions: solvation entropy (<i>ΔS</i><sub>solv</sub>) and conformational entropy (<i>ΔS</i><sub>conf</sub>). The solvation entropy consists of the apolar and polar solvation entropy, which is typically given by an empirical formula that is proportional to the apolar and polar solvent accessible surface area differences. We use the <i>molsurf</i> and <i>surf</i> modules in Amber program to calculate the solvent accessible surface area. The conformational entropy is related to the change of the number of rotatable bonds during the binding process. The change of the conformational entropy is proportional to the number of the lost rotatable bonds during the binding process. The <i>conf</i> module in Amber is used to calculate the number of the rotatable bonds. More details can be found in the previous work (<a href="#bib7">Pan et al., 2008</a>). The binding affinity ΔG<sub>bind</sub> for a complex is the average value of 50 structural snapshots.</li>
<li>The binding affinity differences ΔΔG between the protein-hit and protein-analogs complexes are then obtained as ΔΔG = ΔG<sub>bind</sub> (Analogs) – ΔG<sub>bind</sub> (Hit).</li>

<p>We obtain a series of hit analogs from the initial hit molecule. The binding affinity of each analog compound interacting with the protein has been evaluated. Then the binding affinity changes between the protein-analogs and protein-hit complexes are calculated. A negative change of binding free energy indicates an increase in the binding affinity, while a positive change of binding free energy indicates a decrease in the binding affinity. Potential lead compounds are identified based on the rank of the changes of binding free energy. <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>A shows the results of the binding affinity changes, which contain the information about the analog compound structures, fragment molecules, substituent positions, and binding affinity changes. In addition, a heatmap is plotted to graphically display the relationship between the generated analog compounds and their binding affinity changes (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>B). The horizontal axis represents fragment molecules, and the vertical axis represents hydrogen atoms where the fragment molecules are linked. The darker the red, the more active the compound is. The darker the blue, the less active the compound is. AILDE not only generates the analog compounds, also predict their binding poses in the protein. The binding modes of the compounds interacting with the protein are explored by analyze the complex structures (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>C).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>AILDE is based on an assumption that there are no substantial changes in the binding modes between protein-hit and protein-analogs complexes. AILDE could not achieve a good performance in a complicated situation of activity cliffs. This is caused by the compounds with similar structures, but have large differences in binding affinity (<a href="#bib8">Stumpfe and Bajorath, 2012</a>). In this protocol, a small fragment library is applied to generate the potential lead compounds. It is suggested to utilize larger chemical space to search and predict more possible lead compounds. The molecular weight of a fragment molecule is recommend to be less than 90 g/mol for a good performance.</p>

<p>All the input files for AILDE are identified in the parameter file. We should prepare a suitable parameter file according to the example file provided in AILDE source code. We recommend changing the paths of the necessary data file in the example file.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The molecular dynamics simulation terminates abnormally.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We recommend using the protein complex with only one ligand compound as the initial structure to perform the molecular dynamics simulation. In preparing the input structure file of the protein complex with a hit ligand, we could remove the unconcerned chemical compounds in the complex structure.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The structures of the hit analogs generated by fragment growing are weird.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We recommend that the conformational optimization should be performed for the fragment molecules in the step of a fragment library construction. Chimera software could be used to conduct the optimization.</p>
