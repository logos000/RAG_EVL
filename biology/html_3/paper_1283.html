<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Here, we present a step-by-step protocol to target, record, and manipulate the activity of oxytocin neurons in awake rats. The protocol includes a procedure to record the activity of oxytocin neurons from awake and socially interacting rats using opto-electrodes for simultaneous electrophysiological recording and virally based cell-type-specific opto-tagging with Channelrhodopsin 2. Furthermore, we illustrate a procedure for optically guided implantation of optic fiber and imaging of oxytocin neuron population activity expressing calcium indicator GCaMP6s with the fiber photometry technique.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00738-3/sref8">Tang et al., 2020</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) is involved in the regulation of behaviors essential to life, including socialization, and is produced by specialized endocrine neurons in the hypothalamus, mostly localized in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei. Recording the activity of OT-producing neurons during naturalistic behaviors is critical to understanding their circuit-specific functions in a living brain.</p>
<p>Selective recording of OT neuronal activity during social behavior has only recently been made possible (<a href="#bib1">Carcea et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib7">Resendez et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib8">Tang et al., 2020</a>) thanks to the employment of recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAVs) vectors that achieve specific expression of transgenes in OT neurons, in combination with electrophysiology or calcium imaging techniques. The two methods that we use for cell-type specific recording in freely moving animals are extracellular recordings of action potentials combined with optogenetic tagging (opto-tagging) (<a href="#bib5">Lima et al., 2009</a>) and imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) (<a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2013</a>), such as GCaMP6s, with fiber photometry.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We have used this protocol in wild type female Wistar rats (age 8–16 weeks), but it could likely be generalized to other strains, sex, or age without major modifications.</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–1.5 h (3–4 weeks before the recording experiment)</div>
<p>The goal of this preparation is to deliver 300 nL of rAAV solution (titer 10<sup>9</sup>–10<sup>10</sup> vg/mL, dissolved in saline) into the PVN and SON to express transgenes specifically in OT neurons via a small OT promoter sequence incorporated into the vector (for details, see <a href="#bib4">Knobloch et al., 2012</a>).</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To ensure minimal tissue damage, glass pipettes should be at least 10 mm long with a tip diameter between 20 and 50 μm that enlarge up to 150–200 μm at their “shoulder” (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D). In this protocol we use 10 μL glass pipettes (IntraMARK, BRAND) and a P-97 pipette puller with the following parameters: TEMP 650; PULL 30; VEL 70; TIME 200. We then cut the pipette tip with fine scissors and check the tip diameter under the microscope. Optimal parameters may vary between pullers and pipette type.</div>
<ol>
<li>Induce general anesthesia by inhalation of isoflurane gas at 3% concentration and progressively lower the concentration to 1–2% (0.2 L/min).
<ol type="a">
<li>To achieve full analgesia, administer a subcutaneous injection of both bupivacaïne (2 mg/kg) and an NSAID drug, such as meloxicam (2 mg/kg) following veterinary recommendations.</li>
<li>Periodically monitor the animal’s respiration rate throughout the surgery and adjust the isoflurane concentration accordingly.</li>
<li>24 h after surgery, supplement the water with meloxicam (2 mg/kg) for <i>ad libitum</i> use during the recovery process.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Appropriate regulations for experiments with rats must be followed. The procedure must comply with animal surgery guidelines, including the use of aseptic surgical techniques to prevent possible infection as well as the use of appropriate anesthesia and analgesia to minimize pain. The present experiments were approved by the Committee on Animal Health and Care of the government of Baden-Württemberg in Karlsruhe under the licenses 35-9185.81/G-102/17 and 35.9185.81/G-193/20.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Place the rat on a heating pad to maintain a constant body temperature of 37°C. Shave the fur from the scalp and then fix the head in the stereotaxic frame with two ear bars and a nose clamp equipped with an inhalation mask (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>F1).</li>
<li>Before starting the surgery:
<ol type="a">
<li>Apply eye ointment to prevent the animal’s eyes from drying out.</li>
<li>Clean the scalp with betadine.</li>
<li>Check for the absence of the withdrawal reflex to a foot pinch.</li>
<li>Make sure to use sterilized surgery tools (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Make an incision (1–1.5 cm) with a surgical blade along the midline of the scalp.
<ol type="a">
<li>Remove the periosteal soft tissue within the incised area.</li>
<li>Clean the surface of the skull with sterilized 0.9% saline solution.</li>
<li>Bregma and Lambda should be clearly visible after cleaning.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Ensure that Bregma and Lambda are level in the horizontal plane. The dorsal/ventral difference should be less than 70 μm. For optimal accuracy, also verify that the dorsal/ventral difference between two symmetrical points on the skull (e.g. ±2 mm lateral from the midline) is minimal.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Mark the position of the center of the craniotomy with a thin marker pen (1.8 mm posterior to Bregma and 0.35 mm lateral for the PVN, 1.2 mm posterior to Bregma and 1.8 mm lateral for the SON) (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>F4).</li>
<li>Perform the craniotomy (0.5 mm circular shaped hole) above the target region using a high-speed drill and a 0.6 mm drill tip with ball nose. If excessive bleeding occurs, please refer to ‘<a href="#sec6.1">problem 1</a>’ for potential solutions.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Cautious drilling should be used when targeting the PVN to avoid piercing the numerous blood vessels located near the midline. In case of bleeding, gently apply pressure to the hole using a hemostat and a cotton tip until it stops flowing. Apply sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution or sterile saline to clean the excess blood and prevent further bleeding.</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Fix the glass pipette to the stereotaxic arm and secure the small tube onto the top-end of the glass pipette to create an airtight seal. This seal will allow for accurate aspiration or dispensation of the viral solution using negative or positive pressure, respectively.
<ol type="a">
<li>Place a sterile square of Parafilm onto the head of the rat and use a standard laboratory pipette to transfer the required volume of viral solution (plus extra) onto it.</li>
<li>Avoid aspirating air while transferring the viral solution to the parafilm square (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>F2).</li>
<li>Load the glass pipette with the viral solution while being careful not to damage the tip or aspirate air.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Move the glass pipette tip to the appropriate coordinates relative to bregma.
<ol type="a">
<li>Insert the glass pipette into the brain through the previously drilled hole until reaching the desired depth (DV = −8.0 for PVN and −9.25 for SON).</li>
<li>Slowly inject 300 nL of the virus (100 nL/min) followed by a 3 min wait period to allow for adequate diffusion.</li>
<li>Retract the pipette very slowly for the first 500 μm (10 μm/s) and then increase to a normal speed (100 μm/s) until the pipette is clear of the skull (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>F3 and 1F4).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> For the PVN, the glass pipette might bend before going through the dura and the vein. This is especially true when using longer, more flexible pipette tips (below the shoulder of the glass pipette). Therefore, in order to successfully insert the pipette without breaking the tip, the length of the pipette tip should be shortened to the point at which it will go through without breaking while still being long enough to reach the target site. We recommend injecting the SON first, as it requires longer pipettes. The pipette tip might get clotted, in this case lift up the tip a bit and apply a strong pressure in the syringe, sometimes it helps to unblock the clot. Alternatively, you can use a cotton swab soaked in warm saline to apply warmth to the pipette tip as this will often cause the blood to release. Use another dry cotton swab to absorb the excess saline and release blood. Otherwise, it should be cut with small scissors and the zero-point has to be readjusted to Bregma.</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Protect the virus injection holes with silicone elastomers (Kwik-SilKS, a bio-compatible surgical adhesive) to avoid tissue hyperplasia. This step is essential for the facilitation of opto-electrode implantation after 3 weeks.</li>
<li>Close the wound using surgical sutures, apply lidocaine and disinfect the sutured wound before placing the rat in a heated recovery cage. Return the rat to the home cage once it has recovered from anesthesia.</li>
<li>Check the animal’s health status and administer analgesics (for example: carprofen (5 mg/kg) once daily for 48–72 h) following surgery. If the animal still shows signs of pain, administer additional analgesics, such as metamizol (100 mg/kg up to 3 times a day), Tramadol, Rimadyl, etc., as needed. Always follow local animal facility guidelines when choosing which drugs to administer.</li>

<p>Steps 1–36 outline how to perform photo-assisted recording of oxytocin neurons in freely moving rats.</p>
<h3 id="sec2.1">Chronic implantation of an opto-electrode and microdrive</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 h</div>
<p>OT neurons reside mainly in the PVN and SON together with other neuronal cell types, making them difficult to target during <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology experiments. This issue can be solved by employing viral tools that enable the expression of particular transgenes in the desired cell population. Here we describe a procedure to implant an opto-electrode, which is an optic fiber coupled to a recording electrode, into the target brain region to allow for optogenetic tagging (opto-tagging) of the OT neuron population.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The term ‘opto-electrode’ used in this text will refer to an optic fiber coupled to either a basic silicon electrode (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A1) or a tetrode (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A2), both of which have been tested using this protocol. Both types have different strengths and limitations, therefore the choice of opto-electrode will depend on the specific goals of the study.</div>

Left panel is the magnified view of anopto-electrode tip (∼ 100 μm in diameter, black bar = 150 μm). Right panel is the microdrive (oDrive, Neuronexus) with the integrated opto-electrode fully retracted. (A2) Tungsten-wire tetrodes mounted with eight independent shuttle drives (VersaDrive-8 Optical, Neuralynx) surrounding an optic fiber in the middle (opto-tetrode).

<p>(B1) Surgical steps for the implantation of the microdrive: two ground/reference screws are implanted in the posterior part of the skull and craniotomy holes are drilled above the target brain areas. Scale bar, 500 μm. (B2) Use pre-heated wax to seal the implantation hole and the naked opto-electrode shank, then apply a 3D-printed plastic cover around the probe implantation site and fix it with UV glue. Finally, suture the skin, put a copper mesh around the whole implanted drive and solder the grounding wires to the copper mesh to form a mini-faraday cage (see C2). (B3) Mount the microdrive on the stereotaxic arm with the adapter, loosen the lateral screws to free the optic fiber (see text) before implantation. Then align the probe tip to Bregma zero point and move it above the target coordinates, and slowly implant it half way before the mirodrive base touches the skull. Fix the microdrive base on the skull first with UV-glue, then apply dental cement. (B4) Mounting of the attached omnetics connector onto the microdrive.</p>

<p>This approach combines the extracellular recording of neural activity with the selective excitation of OT neurons via the cell-type specific expression of channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2), an excitatory light-sensitive ion-channel activated by a specific wavelength of light (λ ∼ 470 nm). In this approach, the opto-electrode is accompanied by a microdrive (oDrive, Neuronexus or Versa-8 optical, Neuralynx) which will be fixed to the top of the skull following implantation of the opto-electrode. The microdrive is shielded from physical damage and electrical interference by using a protective copper mesh, which facilitates chronic recording in freely moving rats.</p>

<li>For surgery preparation, follow steps 1–5 of the viral injection section in the “<a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a>” section after making note of the following modifications:
<ol type="a">
<li>Make the incision on the skin at least 2 cm long and use four bulldog skin clamps to ensure adequate exposure of the entire Bregma–Lambda region, which is required for successful implantation of the opto-electrode/microdrive system.</li>
<li>Clean the skull around the implantation site with 2% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to prevent micro-bleeding before drilling any extra holes.</li>
<li>Avoid leakage of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into the holes designated for viral injection.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Using the high-speed drill, make six holes (0.5 mm diameter) in the skull around the implantation site. Install two stainless-steel screws (0.6 mm diameter) pre-soldered with silver wires (ground and reference) in the two most caudal holes (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B1). Install regular stainless-steel screws in the remaining four holes.</li>
<li>Cover the six screws with a thin layer of UV glue (RelyX Unicem 2 Self-Adhesive Resin Cement) for better anchoring on the skull surface.
<ol type="a">
<li>Make sure not to apply any glue to the Bregma point and implantation site as they have to remain intact for the following steps.</li>
<li>Use micro-drills (HSS mini milling cutters 0.5 × 40 mm ball nose) to enlarge the PVN injection hole for the implant, and remove the debris with a rubber suction bulb.</li>
<li>Penetrate the dura with a fine needle or insect pin.</li>
<li>If bleeding occurs, apply gentle pressure with a micro hemostatic sponge. If excessive bleeding occurs, please refer to ‘<a href="#sec6.1">problem 1</a>’ for potential solutions.</li>

We recommend using a 200 μm fiber cannula with a 0.37 NA (numerical aperture) to ensure sufficient light coverage and penetration of the recording area. The conductance of each channel should be measured before implantation. We recommend gold-plating the tetrode tips and checking before implantation that the impedance of each electrode is 0.3–0.5 MΩ.

<p>After the identification of light responding cells (opto-tagging), it is important to perform the <i>in vivo</i> recordings with experiment protocols as soon as possible, usually within 3–7 days, to maximize the likelihood of acquiring the signal from the same opto-tagged neurons. The following protocol can be used for extracellular recording in freely-moving rats and social interaction of novel conspecific rats.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>Bring the experimental rat and the stimulus rats into the recording room at least 30 min prior to the recording, to allow the rats to habituate to the new environment (this might vary depending on your experimental design).</li>
<li>Place the experimental rat, already connected to the neural recording system, into the recording chamber (open field arena, square 60 × 60 cm) and start the recording session (electrophysiology recording and video camera need to be synchronized, e.g., by TTL outputs or LEDs).</li>
<li>Let the rat freely explore the open field arena for 10 min. This session will serve as a ‘baseline’. Gently remove the rat from the arena and place it into an empty clean cage for an interval of 15 min.</li>
<li>For social interaction, place the experimental rat and a conspecific naïve rat (in our case, female Wistar rat, 8–16 weeks old, 220–300 g) in opposite corners of the recording chamber at the same time and let them interact for 10 min (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D2).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Always thoroughly clean the arena with 70% ethanol followed by distilled water prior to the experiment to remove any odour that may alter the normal behavior of the rats.

This mimicry can be achieved by applying external stimuli, such as ‘airpuffs’, to the rat as described in <a href="#bib8">Tang et al., 2020</a>. To record neural activity of OT neurons with temporary opto-electrodes in anesthetized rats, follow the same procedure as described in steps 1–13 and 14–21 for chronic implantation with the following changes:</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Opto-tetrodes are not suitable for acute recordings because they bend easily during repeated use and are difficult to clean between implantations.</div>

<li>Connect the probe’s ground and reference pins with the wires attached to the ground and reference screws, respectively.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is recommended to solder micro connectors to the grounding wires on screws and probes before implantation to facilitate the process. Otherwise you will need to solder the wires together during implantation.</div>

</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Electrophysiological recordings of anesthetized rats that are head-fixed to the stereotaxic device require an electrically isolated environment (ideally a faraday cage over the whole setup) and proper grounding (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>E), as any open-end electronic devices nearby can generate electrical noise detectable by the preamplifier. In our experience, the digital meter of the stereotaxic frame, the heating plate, and the laser generators (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>G) were the major sources of electrical noise. It is important to ground everything to the faraday cage and check the basal noise level of the signal (&lt;25 μV after applying band-pass filter) before implanting and recording. If neural recordings display high amounts of electrical noise and/or a low signal-to-noise ratio, please refer to ‘<a href="#sec6.5">problem 3</a>’ for potential solutions.</div>

If action potentials (spikes) still cannot be detected after repositioning the opto-electrode in the target region, please refer to ‘<a href="#sec6.9">problem 5</a>’ for potential solutions.</li>
<li>Perform an acute recording of opto-tagged OT neurons while delivering external sensory stimulation, such as ‘airpuffs’, to the rat (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>F).</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Silicon Probe cleaning and care protocol:</div>
<p>After withdrawing the probe from the brain tissue at the end of an experiment, immediately rinse it with a gentle stream of distilled water. Soak the probe (only the silicon shank; avoid soaking the epoxy or PCB) in a protein-dissolving detergent (e.g., enzyme cleaner AN000689 from Thomas Recording, 1 g/50 mL of distilled water) or diluted surgical instrument detergent (e.g., EmPower from Metrex, 1:128 in 20°C–40°C water). This process may take 0.5–2 h depending on the residual tissue. After the protein dissolving procedure, isopropyl alcohol (e.g., 70% IPA) can be used for sterilization, but not for more than 15 s. Using isopropyl alcohol without firstly dissolving the residual tissue from the probe could cause protein to stick to the electrode sites. Do not use ultrasonic cleaners and do not autoclave probes as this may cause damage.</p>

<h3 id="sec2.5">Optically assisted implantation of optic fiber for photometry recording</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30–45 min</div>
<p>Fiber photometry allows for the capture of calcium-dependent fluorescent activity in a cell-type specific neuronal population, such as the OT neurons in the PVN, using an optic fiber. This technique relies on the expression of a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) that changes its fluorescence as a function of intracellular calcium ion concentration. Among these sensors, the most commonly used are proteins from the GCaMP family (<a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2013</a>), which are able to rapidly emit a fluorescent signal (λ = 473 nm excitation peak wavelength, λ = 515 nm emission peak wavelength) in response to changes in intracellular free calcium concentration. These fluorescent signals are commonly used as a proxy for neural activity. Three to four weeks after the injection of a viral vector designed to express GCaMP6s in OT neurons (rAAV-OTp-GCaMP6s) in the PVN, an optic fiber is implanted above the PVN where it collects the fluorescent signal emitted by the OT neural ensemble (<a href="#bib3">Grund et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib8">Tang et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The implantation procedure can be optimized by recording the signal from the optic fiber during surgery. Once the optic fiber tip is approaching the target region where GCaMP6s is expressed, it is expected to detect an increase of the fluorescence collected in the green channel (515 nm).</div>

<li>Connect the fiber tip to the fiber photometry recording setup with an optic patch cord (mono fiber optics patch cord, Doric Lenses) and visualize the output fluorescence.

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We recommend using a 400 μm diameter, 0.5 NA implantable fiber cannula that can capture the fluorescence emitted from a larger brain volume and thereby increase the signal-to-noise ratio up to 4 times greater than a fiber cannula with a 200 μm core diameter.</div>

<li>While inserting the optic fiber into the brain tissue, the experimenter should see a visible increase in the fluorescent signal when approaching the region where the calcium sensor is expressed. Fine tune the final depth of the fiber in such a way as to maximize the fluorescent signal.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If the optic fiber was successfully implanted above the GCaMP6s sensor expression site, it should be detected as an increase of the background fluorescent signal, as well as transient calcium signals due to spontaneous activity of the cells.</div>

<h3 id="sec2.6">Photometry recording of a neural population in vivo</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–3 h</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Allow at least 1 week of recovery from the surgery before starting the imaging session. Usually, the signal to noise ratio of fiber photometry will increase after recovery from bleeding and inflammation caused by implantation surgery. Choose a fiber patch cord with low auto-fluorescence (LAF, Doric Lenses). Photo-bleaching is advised 1 h prior to the recording session to minimize auto-fluorescent noise (for details refer to the protocol below). The auto-fluorescent noise is mainly generated from the external layers of the fiber patch cord. If using a CMOS camera-based fiber photometry system, this issue can be softened by selecting a region of interest only in the center of the fiber core.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Patch Cord Photobleaching protocol (derived from Doric Lenses, (<a href="https://www.doriclenses.com/downloads/ApplicationNotes/LAF_Application_Note_V1.0.0.pdf">https://www.doriclenses.com/downloads/ApplicationNotes/LAF_Application_Note_V1.0.0.pdf</a>).</div>
<p>Due to their chemical composition optical fibers possess an innate fluorescence (autofluorescence), which may interfere with photometry measurements. Autofluorescence can be drastically reduced through photobleaching, which involves exposing the fiber to light of a high intensity in order to bleach the fluorophores responsible for autofluorescence. Photobleaching is necessary before any photometry experiment and has to be performed while the system is disattached from experimental subjects (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B1).</p>
<p>The procedure includes the following steps: Connect one end of the patch cord to the optical fiber output of a blue LED light source, typically the one used for the experiment. Place the opposite end of the patch cord in a beam dump or black box. The disconnected end of the patch cord will emit intense light during the photobleaching process; it is important that it is isolated to avoid harm or damage. Set the output current of the light source to its maximum value. Leave the light on for 1–2 h. An illumination for 1–2 h should decrease the autofluorescence by 75 % (typically) of its initial value. Further photobleaching (12+ hours) can reduce the natural autofluorescence by 90% (typically) of its initial value. Repeat the process for each patch cord should there be multiple channels. Photobleaching provides a temporary reduction of autofluorescence. Repeat this procedure before each experiment to ensure a minimal level of autofluorescence. As autofluorescence recovery is very slow, a simple 1 h exposure can be sufficient if the patch cord was used in the last few days. If motion noise or artifacts are present during fiber photometry in vivo imaging, please refer to ‘<a href="#sec6.13">problem 7</a>’ for potential solutions.</p>

It is also important to make sure the DAQ system itself is grounded because electrical noise can contaminate the voltage-converted fluorescent analog signal (output of the fiber photometry recording system, <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C2).

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Here, we illustrated two techniques to monitor the activity of OT neurons <i>in vivo</i>: electrophysiological recordings from individual opto-tagged neurons, and fiber photometry imaging of cell-type specific neuronal population activity. Proper implantation of the recording opto-electrodes should allow for 3–5 days of productive recording after optogenetic tagging, as well as recording of other neighboring neurons and local field potentials, while the animal is performing behavioral tasks. Between recording sessions, it is recommended to repeat the opto-tagging procedure to ensure that the recorded units are stable over time.</p>
<p>The relationship between OT neural activity and social behavior is still not fully understood. We recently demonstrated that social interactions between conspecific female rats elicit a synchronous increase of OT neuron firing activity together with an intensification of the bursting activity of the cells. These physiological responses of individual OT cells were mostly driven by the physical contacts which naturally occur during social behavior between the two rats. This observation was made possible by closely monitoring animal movements during social interactions with a high-speed, high-resolution video camera and then matching the timing of specific behaviors with the neural activity of opto-tagged neurons.</p>
<p>Single-unit recordings of OT neurons in socially interacting rats revealed synchronous activation of individual cells, however the number of neurons that can be recorded at the same time from the same animal is limited. To probe the activity of the whole OT cell ensemble, we employed photometry recording of GCaMP6s-expressing OT neurons with an optic fiber. This technique allows us to monitor in real time the calcium-dependent activity of the neuronal population expressing the calcium indicator within a certain volume of tissue which, in this case, is enough to cover the majority of OT cells residing in the PVN. The data collected with fiber photometry imaging gave us a comprehensive overview of the overall activity of PVN OT neurons in response to non-noxious somatosensory stimulation in real-time.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<h3 id="sec4.1">Spike sorting of neural data</h3>
<p>After collecting neural signals with extracellular recording, single units can be isolated offline for classification and analysis. This step is necessary to obtain high-quality data from single units. We use Offline Sorter (Plexon) to sort spikes recorded from individual neurons (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The manual sorting method described below is recommended for opto-tetrode based recording, but not for Neuronexus opto-probes, in which case we recommend Phy-sorter (<a href="https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>), a software designed for high-density channel spike sorting.</div>
<ol>
<li>Load the recorded neural data into the Offline Sorter program. OpenEphys or Intan formatted data needs to be converted into plx format first; this can be done with MATLAB tools published by OpenEphys (<a href="https://github.com/open-ephys/analysis-tools/tree/master/ephys2plx">https://github.com/open-ephys/analysis-tools/tree/master/ephys2plx</a>).</li>
<li>Set the data into ‘tetrodes mode’ for simultaneous detection of spikes across four channels. Apply a high-pass, 250 Hz butterworth filter and set a threshold (3 times standard deviation of the noise level) for detection of action potentials independently in each of the four channels.</li>
<li>Exclude the high amplitude noise in each channel as well as the noise shared across all channels (offline sorter built-in function, use with caution). Align the waveforms such that there is only 100 ms between the valley points (global minimum between sort start and sort end).</li>
<li>Visualization of waveform features and clustering:
<ol type="a">
<li>Visualize the spike clusters in 3D feature projections, the most commonly-used features are principal component analysis (PCA), peak-valley slice and timesteps.</li>
<li>Adjust the features and view angles from 3D clusters, until clear clusters are found.</li>
<li>Manually draw a circle at the center of each potential cluster then apply template sorting with 70% tolerance. This step helps to keep the sorting quality equal in all channels.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Invalidate the noise in all units manually (sometimes noise can be similar to a waveform, but it can be distinguished with the timestep feature) and remove the waveforms that have inter-spike intervals (ISI) shorter than 1500 ms (Offline Sorter will show a line between two points in the 3D clusters). Check that the sorted units have a clear refractory period by visualizing the autocorrelation histogram for each unit.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> OT neurons usually have long absolute refractory periods (&gt;2 ms). Other neuronal cell types, such as fast-spiking interneurons, sometimes have shorter absolute refractory periods (&lt;1 ms). Adjust this ISI parameter in Offline Sorter according to the recorded cell-types.</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>When analyzing multiple recording sessions from the same cells, it is recommended to keep the sorted units in the same order across multiple recorded files.</li>
<li>Save the sorted neural data by exporting it to a new plx file. Convert the data format in order to visualize the results in a data analysis software such as Neuroexplorer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sec4.2">Analysis of local field potentials</h3>
<p>Local field potentials (LFPs) can be studied by analyzing the same raw data acquired during extracellular recording.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Load the recorded neural data into MATLAB and downsample it to 3 kHz.</li>
<li>Filter the data with a low-pass (200 Hz) butterworth filter to remove high frequency noise.</li>
<li>Examine the power spectrum density (PSD) of the LFP signal by applying a multitaper PSD estimate (‘pmtm’ function in MATLAB with a frequency range of 1–200 Hz).</li>
<li>Extract the oscillatory activity of specific frequency bands and calculate the point-by-point phase with Hilbert’s transformation (‘hilbert’ function in MATLAB).</li>
<li>Correlate the activity of single units (action potentials) with the phase of LFP oscillations in different frequency bands to detect phase-locking of neuron activity with specific phases of the oscillation cycle.</li>
<li>Use Rayleigh’s test for circular uniformity to assess the significance of the correlation between action potential timing and cycle phase.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec4.3">Analysis of fiber photometry data</h3>
<ol start="14">
<li>Load the recorded raw voltage signal data into MATLAB and downsample it to 300 Hz</li>
<li>Filter the data with a low-pass (10 Hz) butterworth filter to remove high frequency noise.</li>
<li>Apply the same step on the reference channel (if a 405 nm control signal was recorded simultaneously), then subtract it from the calcium dependent (473 nm) signal (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>D).</li>
<li>Visualize the collected signal and remove possible non-neural artifacts (very fast, abrupt, and symmetric transients) due to micro-movements of the optic fiber cannula (motion noise).</li>
<li>Fluorophores are subject to photo-bleaching when excited with continuous light over time, which means that the average signal decreases over time as the emitted fluorescence slowly attenuates. To correct this effect, apply a non-linear polynomial fit (MATLAB ‘polyfit’ function) to the whole recording and subtract it from the raw data to obtain a stationary baseline (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>E).</li>
<li>Smooth the signal with a Savitzky-Golay filter (MATLAB ‘smooth’ function, option ‘sgolay’).</li>
<li>Convert the signal F to DF/F by applying DF/F(<i>t</i>) = (F(<i>t</i>) – F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> , where <i>t</i> is time and F<sub>0</sub> is the average value of F calculated over a 600 s window at the beginning of the recording session (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>F).</li>
<li>Divide the data into 1 min time bins and calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of the signal using the MATLAB ‘trapz’ function to estimate the amount of calcium transients (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>G).</li>
<li>Use ratios of AUCs between different experimental conditions to quantify the activity of the recorded neural population.</li>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol is applicable only to cell types for which viral vectors with specific transgene expression or transgenic animals are available. The two recording methods described in this protocol (electrophysiology with opto-tagging and fiber photometry imaging) have opposing strengths and limitations. For example, extracellular recordings from opto-electrodes have both high temporal (30 kHz sampling rate to capture extracellular spikes in sub-milliseconds scale) and single cell resolution with opto-tagging, but only a limited number of units can be recorded in each animal due to the probe channel density, implantation precision, and viral expression efficiency; on the contrary, calcium imaging with fiber photometry using a large fiber core and NA allows for monitoring the activity of large neuronal populations that have been specifically labeled using viral vectors. However, the temporal resolution is limited by the dynamics of the fluorophore and single cell resolution is lost as well. Moreover, recording from opto-tagged cells may not be feasible if the neuronal population of interest is sparsely distributed in a large volume due to the physical distance from the recording electrodes. In the future, it may become more feasible to integrate the two techniques into one approach, which would ameliorate many of these limitations and provide an even greater level of detail regarding the function of specific cell-types at both the single-cell and population level.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>In this section we summarize the potential problems which can occur during the surgical procedures or during the recording and highlight some possible solutions.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Excessive bleeding during the surgery after removing the dura (step 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When bleeding happens, repeatedly wash the brain surface with sterilized 0.9% saline solution for 1–2 min and apply a hemostatic gauze to stop the bleeding. Keep the skull moist with saline throughout the surgery.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Large photo-electrical artifacts from the laser stimulation are detected on the recording electrodes (step 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Move the optic fiber tip further away from the electrode recording sites. For the opto-probes, contact the manufacturer to customize the fiber tip and recording site distances to suit your specific needs. Check for leakage of light in the optic fiber shank as it may also result in artifacts. For opto-tetrodes, position the tetrode tips 300–500 μm from the tip of the optic fiber when assembling the microdrive. Decrease the laser power and check the interconnector light leakage, sometimes adding a shelter around the optic interconnector (mating sleeve) may prevent opto-electrical noise. The photo-electrical artifacts are present only at the beginning and the end of laser pulse stimulation (e.g., at 0 ms and 10 ms when delivering a 10 ms laser pulse), thus it may be possible to exclude them from the recorded data during the offline spike sorting process.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Neural recordings display high amounts of electrical noise and/or a low signal-to-noise ratio (step 10).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are several potential causes for electrical noise and/or a low signal-to-noise ratio in electrophysiology recordings. Check the environmental electrical noise before implantation. The neural recording system should be separated from other electrical devices and all of them should be grounded. Ideally, the whole setup should be installed on an electrically isolated table (faraday cage). Computers, screens, power supplies, and the DAQ system should be grounded as well. Furthermore, make sure that the grounding electrode is properly connected to the ground on the skull screw during implantation. Use dental cement to fix the wire around the ground and reference screw to prevent movement of the wire while the rat is moving. In acute recording, lowering the electrode very slowly will increase the likelihood of obtaining high-quality recordings. In chronic recordings, wait a few days after surgery and propel the electrodes 100–200 μm each day until obtaining an optimal signal.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The implanted head-stage has become detached or broken (step 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is often caused by poor implantation of the anchor screws, a bad dental cement seal between the skull, or using excessive force while connecting the wires (see Major Step 1–1). Thoroughly cleaning the skull before applying dental cement or increasing the number of anchor screws on the skull may help.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>No action potentials (spikes) are detected with the recording electrodes in the target region (PVN) (step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that all connections (e.g., preamplifier, recording cable) are still properly in place and not loose. Monitor the presence of spikes during the whole implantation procedure: while inserting into the brain tissue, spikes should be visible when the electrodes penetrate into regions with high neuronal density (i.e., hippocampus and thalamus). If the latter occurs, but no spikes are visible at PVN depth, it is likely that the electrode was implanted in the third ventricle. In which case, slowly retract the opto-electrode from the brain, wash the shank with enzymatic detergent and PBS, carefully removing any tissue attached to the probe or fiber tip. Next, correct the stereotaxic coordinate (try moving the position of the probe 100 μm anterior or posterior) and re-implant following the step-by-step procedure. The absence of action potentials might also be caused by a generally low level of neural activity due to the depth of anesthesia; this also depends on the type of anesthesia used and the region that is recorded from.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>No neurons respond to the blue laser stimuli or have a long delay and/or jittered response (step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This can happen for different reasons. Firstly, the opto-electrode must be implanted correctly at the ChR2 expression site. Secondly, the optic fiber aligned with the electrodes must be close enough (200–500 μm) to stimulate the ChR2 neurons with light pulses. Finally, a delayed signal may be indirectly caused by OT receptor expressing neurons in the PVN that are responding to OT released from the OT expressing neurons that were stimulated by the blue light (also see <a href="#sec6.17">problem 9</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Motion noise or artifacts are present during <i>in vivo</i> fiber photometry imaging (step 45).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that the connection between the optic fiber and the fiber patch cord is properly aligned. Pre-bleach the fiber patch cord before recording (as described in steps 45–46). Using a longer fiber patch cord can help reduce the cable tension when recording in freely moving animals.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.15">Problem 8</h3>
<p>No fluorescent signal or very weak signal was detected with fiber photometry imaging (step 46).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.16">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This typically occurs when the optic fiber is too far from the GCaMP6s expression site. The maximum signal is usually achieved when the fiber tip is ∼100–200 μm above the fluorescent region. Carefully verify the implant location each time after finishing a recording (steps 47–58). Another possible reason is that the fiber tip is dirty or damaged (either the implanted fiber cannula or the fiber patch cord); apply ethanol on the fiber tip and clean it carefully, polish both sides of the fiber patch cord to increase the light coupling efficiency (also see <a href="#sec6.3">problem 2</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.17">Problem 9</h3>
<p>Absent or insufficient expression of transgenes delivered by viral vectors (step 47–58).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.18">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are several potential reasons for absent or low expression of the genes of interest. Make sure that the viral titer is high enough with rt-qPCR (&gt;10<sup>10</sup> genomic copies/mL). Check that the injection site was targeted correctly with histology. Wait at least 3–4 weeks after viral injection before performing the experiment. For theOT promoter, 2% salts in the drinking water can promote the virus expression.</p>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Do not use Lenti- or Rabies- virus in any <i>in vivo</i> opto-tagging approach as neurons will die shortly after transfection. We recommend using only rAAV for this technique.</div>
