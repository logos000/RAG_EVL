<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Low-density cell culture of the postnatal cerebellum, combined with live imaging and single-cell tracking, allows the behavior of postnatal cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) and their progeny to be monitored. Cultured cerebellar NSCs maintain their neurogenic nature giving rise, in the same relative proportions that exist <i>in vivo,</i> to the neuronal progeny generated by the three postnatal cerebellar neurogenic niches. This protocol describes the identification of the nature of the progeny through both post-imaging immunocytochemistry and patch-clamp recordings.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00670-5/sref17">Paniagua-Herranz et al. (2020b)</a>.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 day before recording</div>
<p>The recording electrode is made of a silver wire which should be chlorinated regularly, especially if the chloride coating is wearing off. This is evident when the grey coat is not uniformly distributed, and shiny silver spots appear on the electrode surface.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Connect one of the poles of a 9 V battery to the bare end of the recording electrode (the one soldered to a gold pin that plugs into the head stage of the amplifier), while the other pole is left in contact with a silver wire spring of about 20 turns that extends over 4–5 cm. Both silver wires are immersed in a 0.1 M HCl solution for about 1 min, the time required for AgCl to be deposited on the surface of the recording electrode. Hydrogen air bubbles are produced simultaneously due to the reduction of H<sup>+</sup> in the solution.</li>
<li>Check the appearance and clean the surface of the AgCl pellet of the ground electrode. Immerse the recording electrode and the ground electrode together into the external solution to equilibrate their surface potentials.</li>

Below (in each panel), the voltage (V<sub>p</sub>; test pulses) and current (I<sub>p</sub>) traces are shown on the left, and the corresponding electrical circuit is depicted on the right.

<p>(C) Whole cell. In this configuration, the current is determined by the series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>), in series with a parallel circuit of the membrane resistance (R<sub>m</sub>) and the membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>). The input resistance (R<sub>input</sub>) is the sum of R<sub>s</sub> and R<sub>m</sub>, and it can be calculated using Ohm’s law (R=V/I).

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Pipette resistance should increase to a minimum of 1 GΩ (“giga-seal”). Depending on the cell, this might occur rapidly after coming into contact with the cell and applying negative pressure, or it may require tens of s of continuous negative pressure at negative potentials in the pipette. The formation of the seal implies a dramatic reduction of the current to values close to 0 pA during the voltage pulse. This indicates that the "cell-attached" configuration has been achieved and a patch of membrane is encircled beneath the pipette’s tip</div>
<ol start="75">
<li>Cancel the pipette capacitive transients that are apparent upon giga-seal formation due to current charging/discharging the pipette’s capacitor.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To best perform this task, it is advisable to increase the gain of the amplifier and/or the oscilloscope screen. Depending on the amplifier, oscilloscope and software used, this can be done manually or automatically (e.g., by pressing the “On-cell” key in PATCHMASTER)</div>
<ol start="76">
<li>Set the holding voltage to −70 mV to bring the pipette potential closer to the resting potential of the cell and to prevent cell depolarization when the membrane patch is broken.</li>
<li>Apply brief, intense negative pressure pulses to break open the membrane patch enclosed in the pipette. Do this with care, as excess suction can also disrupt the giga-seal and the cell will no longer be useful. Once you break the patch, electrical access to the cell cytoplasm is achieved and the membrane potential becomes the pipette potential, thereby reaching the “whole-cell” configuration of the patch-clamp technique (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>C).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The whole cell configuration is manifested by a sudden reduction in membrane resistance and the appearance of large capacitive transients.</div>
<ol start="78">
<li>Cancel the cell capacitive transients (due to the charging/discharging of the membrane capacitor), and adjust the amplifier gain and oscilloscope screen parameters to the expected recording conditions (i.e., the size of the currents to be measured). Depending on the amplifier, oscilloscope and software used, this can be done manually or automatically by the software (“Whole-cell” in PATCHMASTER).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In the whole-cell configuration, current flows mostly through the cell membrane as long as the seal resistance is preserved. If the pipette potential is set close to the cell's resting potential before breaking the patch, very little current would be expected during the test pulses and symmetrical current transients will become apparent at the beginning and end of the pulses. These transients reflect both the cell membrane capacitance and the series resistance between the pipette and the cell cytoplasm.</div>
<ol start="79">
<li>Compensate a proportion (70%–90%) of the series resistance for a better voltage-clamp when fast and large currents are to be measured (e.g., voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> currents responsible for action potential generation). It is also convenient to monitor series resistance throughout the experiment.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Ideally, series resistance should be less than twice the pipette resistance. The series resistance should remain low during the whole-cell recording to favor dialysis of the cytoplasm with the internal solution and to prevent voltage-changes caused by large transmembrane currents. Recordings in which series resistance rises by more than 20% with respect to the initial values are usually discarded.</div>
<ol start="80">
<li>Wait several minutes (3–10) to complete the cell dialysis with the internal solution, while monitoring the leak current amplitude and series resistance to assess the stability and voltage-clamp suitability of the seal.</li>
<li>Configure or select (if previously configured) a stimulation protocol and then apply it to the cell under study. Typical protocols include step depolarizations (e.g., a 100 ms pulse to +10 mV) capable of activating voltage-gated ion channels, such as the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels involved in action potential firing. The currents produced in response to voltage-stimulation are recorded and stored for subsequent display and analysis (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>C).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Most protocols to measure voltage-activated currents include the so-called "P/n" procedure to subtract the leak and capacitive currents evoked by any voltage pulse. These are voltage-related currents that are not due to ion flux through membrane ion channels. Since leak and capacitive currents are linearly related to voltage (as they follow Ohm's law), in the P/n procedure they are triggered by small voltage pulses that are unable to activate ion channels (e.g., one quarter or one sixth of the test pulse), and subsequently scaled to the current size produced by the test pulse (e.g., multiplying their amplitudes by four or six). Subtracting the scaled leak and capacitive currents from the current responses evoked by the test pulse allows the voltage-activated ion currents to be isolated. Their presence is taken as evidence of the functional expression of the ion channels mediating them.</div>
<ol start="82">
<li>Carefully bring the pipette close (5–15 μm) to the cell being recorded while monitoring the holding (leak) current as an indicator of seal integrity. Repeat this procedure for every pipette you plan to use in the experiment (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>B).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is convenient to clear external solution from the pipette tip by applying several pressure pulses when it still is far from the cell under study.</div>
<ol start="83">
<li>Apply a pulse of pressure to the interior of the application pipette to deliver the drug (1 mM glutamate, 100 μM GABA or 100 μM 5-HT) used to activate ionotropic receptors. The currents produced in response to agonist-stimulation are recorded and stored for subsequent analysis and display (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>D)</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Sustain drug application for the time needed to produce a clear response and its eventual decline and then, cease the application and washout the drug by perfusion of the external solution. Once the membrane current recovers the baseline, a second drug from a different pipette can be applied.</div>
<ol start="84">
<li>In cells with a leak current of a few pA at a voltage close to the resting membrane potential, it is possible to switch from the voltage-clamp to the current-clamp mode. This allows:
<ol type="a">
<li>To record the resting potential (when I<sub>p</sub> = 0 pA).</li>
<li>To assess changes in membrane potential when current is injected (e.g., a current step of +75 pA for 250 ms) or a receptor agonist is administered (e.g., 100 μM 5-HT).

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Following the fundamental premises of the protocol on which this preparation is inspired (<a href="#bib3">Costa et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib14">Ortega et al., 2011</a>), the cultures are maintained at low cell density with 50,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> plated in a 24 well plate under adherent conditions. It is important to bear in mind that typical yields of cerebellar cells are 1–1.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> per pup for these cell preparations. This low density allows the mode of division and lineage progression of cerebellar NSCs and progenitors to be followed <i>in vitro</i>. Different lineage trees with distinct level of complexity can be tracked during the experiment (e.g., <a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a> and <a href="#fig6">6</a>), although the vast majority of these trees are based on a founder cell that generates two neuroblasts through a symmetric terminal cell division. The trees then involve two, three, four or five rounds of division prior to differentiation, indicating that the cell preparation contains progenitor cells isolated at different stages of progression within the neural lineage.</p>

<p>Remarkably, this cell preparation allows simultaneous monitoring of all the cell populations in the three neurogenic niches of the postnatal cerebellum: the external granular layer (EGL), the Purkinje cell layer (PCL), and the prospective white matter (PWM: (<a href="#bib8">Leto et al., 2016</a>). Accordingly, it is possible to monitor the lineages generating glutamatergic neurons, the main population produced from the EGL (<a href="#bib5">Hallonet et al., 1990</a>; <a href="#bib1">Alvarez Otero et al., 1993</a>), as well as the GABAergic interneurons, parenchymal astrocytes and oligodendrocytes produced in the PWM (<a href="#bib9">Leto et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib18">Parmigiani et al., 2015</a>). In addition, it is also feasible to monitor the behavior of astroglial progenitors, a population generated in the PCL (<a href="#bib2">Buffo and Rossi, 2013</a>). The progenitors isolated <i>in vitro</i> generate glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal progeny in proportions that mimic those that arise <i>in vivo</i> (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>).</p>
<p>Both neuronal populations can be identified and characterized by either PIIC (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>) or by patch-clamp recordings (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>). So, electrophysiological recording allows the expression of voltage- and neurotransmitter-gated ion channels by cerebellar cells to be determined, as well as their electrical excitability. Furthermore, the use of serotonin (5-HT) allows glutamatergic cerebellar neurons to be easily identified, as functional 5-HT<sub>3</sub> ionotropic receptors are expressed only by this cell population in early postnatal life (<a href="#bib11">Oostland et al., 2011</a>) So, most cells with bipolar processes produce membrane currents in response to 5-HT, confirming their glutamatergic nature. Likewise, synaptic transmission in cultured cells can be analyzed.</p>
<p>Finally, it is possible to monitor cerebellar NSCs characterized by the expression of GFAP and SOX2, their cell growth prior to division, and their capability to undergo asymmetric divisions that give rise to a neurogenic branch that becomes progressively smaller and a self-renewal branch to generate new GFAP/SOX2 cells. All these features constitute the stereotypic behavior of NSCs (<a href="#bib19">Temple, 1989</a>; <a href="#bib7">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</a>; <a href="#bib3">Costa et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib13">Ortega and Costa, 2016</a>; <a href="#bib12">Ortega et al., 2013a</a>, <a href="#bib15">2013b</a>; <a href="#bib10">Neumuller et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib16">Paniagua-Herranz et al., 2020a</a>)</p>
<p>Altogether, this cell culture preparation exhibits several intrinsic features that makes it an ideal tool to study the behavior of the postnatal cerebellar NSCs and how niche factors, or pathological situations may modify this behavior. Amongst them it is worthy to highlight that: (i) cerebellar NSCs isolated in this preparation maintain their neurogenic nature even in the absence of niche or mitogenic signals, (ii) it is feasible to monitor the cell populations generated by the three post-natal cerebellar neurogenic niches simultaneously, and (iii) the isolation from their niche enables to study the effect of each niche factor, individually.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This preparation is ideal to perform analysis at the single cell level due to the low cell density employed. However, precisely due to this low cell density the protocol significantly hampers the application of biochemical assays that require large cell numbers. Another inherent limitation regards the long-term maintenance of the cells in culture. As this is a primary culture, differentiation of neural progenitors is restricted to a specific time window (4–5 days), and the neurons generated can also be maintained for a limited period. In our experience we have imaged cerebellar NSCs and their progeny for a maximum of 14 days (average experiments are limited to 7 days), after which the survival of the cells might be compromised.</p>
<p>Another hallmark of this cell preparation is the absence of the signals from the specific neurogenic niches, which may represent both an advantage and a limitation. Interestingly, isolated cerebellar NSCs and progenitors maintain their neurogenic nature even in the absence of such extrinsic signals. This facet is consistent with a considerable part of the cerebellar NSC lineage progression, and that of progenitors, being reproducible in the absence of the signals from their niche. Conversely, in our preparation we did not find the bi-potent progenitors previously described in the PWM that produce both and an astroglial and a GABAergic neuron progeny (<a href="#bib4">Fleming et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib18">Parmigiani et al., 2015</a>). Whether this is due to the scarcity of GFAP/SOX2 NSCs in the PWM and/or the absence of extrinsic signals from the niche is something that will have to be determined in the future.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Difficulty in dissociating the cerebellum, probably due to insufficient enzymatic digestion (step 6).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use fresh papain, and ensure the correct concentration and incubation times are employed. The time of incubation can be increased up to 1 h.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>An excessively large number of dead cells. A decrease in cell viability might be due to harsher trituration or an extended period between removing tissue and its trituration (step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Solution 1: To fix the reduced cell viability due to the harsh trituration, dissociate the cells more gently and avoid the formation of bubbles.</p>
<p>Solution 2: If the loss of cell viability is due to the extended time between removing and triturating the tissue, try to reduce the dissection time by practicing the technique. Speed is essential to maintain cell viability.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Low cellular yields, possibly due to the formation of cell aggregates (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure the adequate, gentle trituration of cells. Increase the number of smooth up and down strokes with the pipette in step 8.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Cells do not adhere to coverslips or Petri dishes when plated (steps 1 b and 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure an adequate volume and concentration of poly-<span class="small-caps">l</span>-lysine is used to coat the coverslips and Petri dishes.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Contamination due to non-sterile conditions (steps 2–8).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Sterilize the dissection tools by autoclaving and clean all the working surfaces areas with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Difficulty to seal and/or to break in (steps 56, 74, and 77)).</p>
<p>The cells do not seal when applying negative pressure and/or the patch does not break or the seal is lost when trying to break into the cell.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check the osmolarity of internal solution, try another batch of internal solution or prepare a new batch.</p>
<p>Check the osmolarity of the external solution.</p>
<p>Pull the pipettes with slightly higher resistance to improve the seals, or with lower resistance to improve patch rupture.</p>
<p>Apply lower negative pressure to prevent the loss of the seal.</p>
