<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a key role in tumor initiation and progression. A real-time tool to evaluate the activation of CSC-specific signaling pathways is crucial for the study of this cancer cell subset. Here, we present a protocol to monitor, <i>in vitro</i>, the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is considered a functional biomarker for colorectal CSCs (CR-CSCs). This flow-cytometry-based protocol allows it to isolate CR-CSCs and to evaluate their cytotoxicity upon anti-tumor treatments.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00586-4/sref3">Di Franco et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5 days</div>
<p>This section describes the transfection protocol of early passage HEK293 cells (15–40 passages) to produce lentiviral particles, using 2<sup>nd</sup> generation helper plasmids.</p>
<ol>
<li>HEK293 cells preparation for transfection.
<ol type="a">
<li>Twenty-four hours before the transfection (i.e., Monday, at 16:00), seed 0.8–1 × 10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 cells (or 293T cells) in a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> Corning® cell culture flask (canted neck, vented cap) with 7 mL of Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and antibiotics/antimycotics (complete EMEM).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> FBS should be heat-inactivated before use by heating it for 30 minutes at 56°C with mixing, to inactivate complement proteins.</div>
</li>
<li>Gently swirl the flask to avoid the formation of cell clumps in the middle of the flask.</li>
<li>Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 18–24 h.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Be aware that after 40 passages, HEK293 cells start changing their morphology, thus randomly affecting the transfection efficiency.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>HEK293 cells transfection for lentiviral particles production.
<ol type="a">
<li>At the time of transfection (i.e., Tuesday, at 16:00), after 18–24 h of incubation, the HEK293 cells should have reached 70%–80% of confluence.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> cell confluence &gt;80% should be avoided since it could affect the transfection efficiency.</div>
</li>
<li>Add 500 μL of Opti-MEM Medium, 12 μL of X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent, 2.6 μg of psPAX2 (#12260, Addgene), 1.4 μg of pMD2.G (#12259, Addgene) (second generation helper plasmids) and 4 μg of TOP-GFP.mC lentiviral vector plasmid (#35491, Addgene), or FOP-GFP.mC (#35492, Addgene) as control (ratio X-tremeGENE HP:DNA = 3 μL : 2 μg), into a 2 mL polypropylene tube and gently swirl the tube. The mix needs to be incubated for at least 30 min at room temperature (23°C–25°C) before proceeding to next steps.</li>
<li>Before transfection, replace the cell culture medium of HEK293 cells with 7 mL of EMEM (10% FBS) without antibiotics/antimycotics, which could interfere with the transfection efficiency.</li>
<li>Add the transfection mix to HEK293 cells in a drop wise manner and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>After 16–24 h of transfection (i.e., Wednesday, at 9:00), gently remove the cell culture medium from the flask and replace it with 7 mL of complete EMEM.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Lentiviral particles collection and storage.
<ol type="a">
<li>After 48 h from transfection (i.e., Thursday, at 16:00), gently collect the cell culture medium from transfected HEK293 cells (first batch, to be stored at 4°C for 24 h) and replace it with fresh complete EMEM.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> At this time, it is highly recommended to check the expression of RFP in HEK293 cells transfected with both TOP-GFP.mC and FOP-GFP.mC lentiviral plasmids, since this is a useful indicator of transfection efficiency. Indeed, both the plasmids constitutively express the mCherry RFP, but only cells transfected with TOP-GFP.mC will express GFP according to Wnt pathway activity (due to a mutation in the TCF/LEF response elements of FOP-GFP.mC plasmid, used as control) If RFP expression is not observed after 48 hours, be aware that the transfection protocol may have not worked properly.</div>
</li>
<li>After 72 h from transfection (i.e., Friday, at 16:00), gently collect the second batch of cell culture medium from transfected HEK293 cells and mix it with the first batch collected the day before.</li>
<li>Spin the collected medium at 1500 <i>g</i> to remove most of the cell components from the supernatant.</li>
<li>Filter the medium with 0.45 μm filters to avoid having any residual HEK293 cell and debris in the medium.</li>
<li>The lentiviruses are concentrated using the Lenti-X Concentrator (for detailed instructions visit <a href="https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/PT4421/PT4421-2.pdf">https://www.takarabio.com/documents/User%20Manual/PT4421/PT4421-2.pdf</a>). The obtained pellet is resuspended in 1/10 to 1/100<sup>th</sup> of the original volume, using Opti-MEM Medium, and stored at −80°C. One fresh lentivirus aliquot should be used for titration to determine the multiplicity of infection (MOI), following a standard titration protocol for lentiviral preparations carrying a fluorescent protein marker (<a href="https://www.addgene.org/protocols/fluorescence-titering-assay/">https://www.addgene.org/protocols/fluorescence-titering-assay/</a>). As an alternative, high-titer lentiviral preparations can be obtained by performing ultracentrifugation in presence of sucrose (<a href="#bib1">Brown et al., 2020</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause point:</span> Proceed with the following steps of the protocol. Alternatively, lentiviral particles can be stored at −80°C for long storage (up to 1 year).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> When working with lentiviral plasmid in absence of constitutive fluorescent protein marker expression, as TOP-GFP (cat. #35489, Addgene), or FOP-GFP as control (#35490, Addgene), lentiviral particles titration can be performed by isolating lentiviral RNA using the NucleoSpin RNA Virus kit (cat. #740956, Macherey-Nagel) and quantifying it using the Quant-X One-Step qRT-PCR TB Green kit (cat. #638317, Takara).</div>

<p>This section describes a protocol for determining the cytotoxicity of certain treatment on cancer cell subpopulation with differential Wnt/β-catenin signaling based on TOP-GFP intensity. It is conventionally believed that CSC population, usually displaying high Wnt/ β-catenin activity, is more resistant to therapies(<a href="#bib4">Di Franco et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib5">Lenos et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib7">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>). With the Wnt/ β-catenin signaling reporter TOP-GFP, CSC population that exhibit high TOP-GFP signal could be specifically screened in cytotoxicity assessment. Consequently, this protocol allows researchers to distinguishably assess the efficiency of the treatment on cancer stem cell or more differentiated population, by FACS, analyzing the induction of cell death (using a dye compatible with GFP and mCherry-RFP) in GFP<sup>high</sup> (Wnt<sup>high</sup>-CSCs) versus GFP<sup>low-neg</sup> (Wnt<sup>low-neg</sup>-progenitor/differentiated) CRC cells.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Lentiviral transduction of CRC cells will allow to monitor the Wnt pathway activity in real-time by simply analyzing the Wnt-driven GFP expression by FACS. This protocol is mainly useful to discriminate CRC stem cells, endowed with high Wnt pathway activity, and progenitors/differentiated cells that are characterized by low activity of Wnt pathway. The evaluation of GFP expression by flow cytometry gives the possibility to investigate the biological properties of these specific cell subsets (i.e., the clonogenic potential) (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>, <a href="#fig7">7</a>, and <a href="#fig8">8</a>), as well as to study the cytotoxic activity of selected anti-tumor compounds (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>, <a href="#fig5">5</a>, and <a href="#fig9">9</a>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Absence of GFP expression following TOP-GFP transduction of CRC cells (step 3a).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Even if it is likely a rare event, it is possible to notice the absence of GFP expression in CRC cells upon transduction with TOP-GFP lentiviral vector (<a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>). This can be a serious issue if the lentiviral plasmid without the constitutive expression of mCherry RFP is used (cat. #35489 and #35490, Addgene), because the absence of GFP could be read as a failure in cell transduction, thus leading to a serious waste of time. In this case, the use of mCherry RFP bearing lentiviral plasmid is highly suggested (cat. #35491 and #35492, Addgene). Moreover, it would be useful to first transiently transfect the CRC cells to evaluate if their Wnt pathway activity is enough to drive the expression of detectable levels of GFP, before proceeding with CRC stable lentiviral transduction.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Absence of violet laser/filter in the flow cytometer/sorter (step 9).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>In this case it is highly recommended the use of a Wnt-reporter plasmid without the constitutive expression of RFP (Addgene, cat. #35489; #35490), thus making it possible the use of a kit of apoptosis with a dye in the red fluorescent channel (i.e., CaspGLO Red Active Caspase Staining Kit, BioVision, cat. #K190 or #K193). Be aware that in this scenario, as mentioned before, the negative expression of GFP after cancer cell transduction, could be due to a non-optimal transduction, or to the low activity of the Wnt pathway, thus making difficult the interpretation of the results.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Evaluation of cytotoxic effects of compounds affecting Wnt pathway activity (steps 9 and 10).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the compound(s) used for evaluation of cytotoxicity in Wnt<sup>high</sup> versus Wnt<sup>low</sup> CRC cells is known to affect the Wnt pathway activity (or when no information has been previously reported), it would be crucial to perform a cell sorting to isolate the two cell subsets before to perform the cytotoxic assay. This experimental setting will allow to evaluate at the same time the induction of cell death and the possible reprogramming in terms of Wnt pathway activity (Wnt<sup>high</sup> to Wnt<sup>low</sup>, and <i>vice versa</i>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>No evidence of cytotoxicity of selected anti-tumor drugs (steps 9 and 10).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To note, following cell sorting, it is common to observe the induction of cell cycle arrest (G0-G1 phase) in CRC cells for 12–24 h, due to the stress of cell sorting procedure. In this scenario, that need to be evaluated in advance, it is crucial to wait 24 h following cell sorting before starting the cytotoxic assay (in particular when using cytotoxic drugs that specifically target proliferating cells).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Excess of cell culture medium evaporation during clonogenic outgrowth (step 18).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Given the low amount of medium in each well of the 96 well plate used for clonogenic assay (about 100–120 μL), and the long-term incubation of the plated cells (15–21 days to observe a clonogenic outgrowth), it is commonly observed a decrease in cell culture medium due to evaporation, which could lead to cell sufferance and compromise the clonogenic outgrowth of cancer cells. If the sorted cells are grown in basal medium, it is possible to refresh the medium in each well over time (adding 20–50 μL once a week). Otherwise, if the cells are plated in cell culture medium containing a specific anti-tumor drug, or cells are grown in suspension, to avoid manipulating the wells (this will introduce a variability in the assay), it is highly recommended to wrap the plate with a single thin layer of parafilm.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>No difference in clonogenic potential between Wnt<sup>high</sup> and Wnt<sup>low</sup> cell subsets (steps 19 and 20).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We have already experienced the possibility to not find any difference in the clonogenic potential of Wnt<sup>high</sup> and Wnt<sup>low</sup> CRC cells. In this scenario, researchers should be aware that the mutational background, in particular the presence of activating mutations occurring in Wnt pathway components (i.e., <i>β-catenin</i> mutation in HCT-116 cell line), could affect CRC cells’ clonogenic potential. Thus, this biological condition leads to a boost in basal Wnt pathway activity, thus making it impossible to notice any difference between Wnt<sup>high</sup> and Wnt<sup>low</sup> CRC cells in terms of clonogenic potential (<a href="#bib7">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Sorted cells show no clonogenic potential (steps 19 and 20).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is important to highlight that some CRC cells strongly suffer from the cell sorting procedure, thus making it difficult to perform the clonogenic assay due to the high induction of cell death. To avoid facing this issue after CRC cell transduction, it would be crucial to select the right cell lines to work with, by performing a preliminary screening of cell lines not suffering from cell sorting protocol.</p>
