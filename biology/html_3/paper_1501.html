<p>The photoresist (NR9-3000PY) should be stored in shade at a temperature of 5°C, while other chemicals in the table should be stored in shade at a temperature of 22°C. The nano/micro fabrication is operated in a cleaning room (ISO Class 5).</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The acetone and isopropyl alcohol are hazardous chemicals because of their inflammability. The Ce(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and concentrated sulphuric acid are extremely hazardous because they are corrosive and oxidative. One should wear face shield, anti-erode glove and protective apron and operate in a fume cupboard for safety.

<p>The following steps describe the process of fabricating the processed mask based on a Cr mask blank (with resist), as the schematic shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.</p>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The following steps to fabricate the processed mask are based on a maskless writing tool (a laser writer). Other similar equipment may require a different set of steps.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The mask blank is a standard commercial soda lime square substrate (2.5 inch) with an AZ photoresist coating (positive tone).</div>
<ol>
<li>Expose the Cr mask blank with a maskless lithograph system, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A.
<ol type="a">
<li>Plot the layout of the 2D periodic array of circles using the free software Klayout. In a layout of 3 cm × 3 cm, the diameter (<i>D</i>) and the period (<i>P</i>) of the circles are 3 <i>μ</i>m and 5.5 <i>μ</i>m, respectively. Save the layout in a format of GDS.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This layout for the maskless lithograph system is a 2D structure (i.e., no depth). In Klayout, a circle is approximated as an equilateral polygon. The size of the GDS file depends on the side number of the polygon, the number of circles and the size of the layout (3 cm × 3 cm in this work). If the GDS file is too large, it cannot be imported into the maskless lithograph system. In this protocol, the number for the sides of the equilateral polygon is 16 and the size of the layout is 3 cm × 3 cm. (Problem 3).</div>
</li>
<li>Import the GDS into the maskless lithograph system (ATD 1500) which can write the mask blank directly with a laser whose operating wavelength is 405 nm.</li>
<li>Place a mask blank on the table of ATD 1500. The mask is kept on the table by vacuum suction. According to the scale of the mask blank (i.e., 2.5 inch), the machine can automatically find the 4 edges of the mask by scanning. Through the coordinates of the edges, the center point of the mask can be determined. The coordinate of each point to be exposed will be determined as well according to the imported GDS file. During the exposing process, the laser is fixed and the table moves under the control of stepping motors. Driven by the table, the mask reaches the exposing position according to the coordinate and the corresponding region be exposed by the laser.
<ol type="i">
<li>The operating power of ATD 1,500 is 66 mW and the offset is −0.0006 mm.</li>
<li>The photo-chemical reaction occurs at the required region due to the laser exposure on the resist of the mask blank.</li>
<li>The exposing process takes ∼30 min.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Develop the exposed mask in AZ300MIF for 50 s to strip the exposed resist, which exposes the underneath Cr layer, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B.</li>
<li>Fix the developed mask in Deionized water for 30 s.</li>
<li>Put the fixed mask in Ce(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> for 70 s to remove the exposed Cr by a wet-etching process.</li>
<li>Use deionized water to rinse the mask.</li>
<li>Blow-dry the mask by N<sub>2</sub> and the mask with patterned Cr and resist is prepared, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C.</li>
<li>Strip the unexposed resist layer with a Piranha solution. The processed Cr mask for photolithography is prepared, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The piranha solution is very dangerous. A detailed description can be found in the “critical” note of the “<a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>” section. An alternative to the piranha solution for stripping unexposed resist is AZ300T, which is much less hazardous (<a href="#bib8">Rackus et al., 2015</a>). A detailed preparation of the piranha solution is introduced here. With a volume ratio of 3:1, measure H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (98 wt. %) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (30 wt. %), respectively. Add H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> slowly, but not vice versa. Because this is an exothermic process, let the mixture cool down before next step. Diluted and exhausted piranha solution is stored in a proper container with a lid and a “Hazardous Waste, Acid Contaminated Objects” label and in a cabinet compatible with strong acid solution, kept separated from strong basic solution and flammable solvents. Waste collection and proper disposal is periodically arranged by vendors which are legally licensed and certified for these procedures. A detailed piranha solution standard operating procedure can also be found in <a href="#bib13">Stevic (2018)</a>.</div>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In this protocol, the negative photoresist liftoff process (<a href="#bib3">Kim et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib12">Xia et al., 2020</a>) is introduced to prepare a multi-layer structure with a 2D array of apertures. To prepare such a photonic structure, we also tried bi-layer liftoff process (<a href="#bib2">Hwang et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib5">Mao et al., 2013</a>) and dry-etching technology (<a href="#bib4">Lehmann and Widmer, 1980</a>; <a href="#bib6">Nojiri, 2015</a>). However, the bi-layer liftoff process failed as it is difficult to strip the exposed-photoresist with the nearby film remaining well. The resolution and density of the pattern produced in this work makes it challenging to control the over-development of the bottom layer to achieve full opening and maintaining good adhesion of the resist mask. The dry-etching process is operated on an inductively coupled plasma etch system (Oxford, PlasmaSystem100 ICP 180). The detailed chemistry of the plasma used and etching recipe are introduced as follows. The mixture of gases is BCl<sub>3</sub>(14sccm) /Ar(6sccm). The power of ICP is 1,000 W. The power of RF is 150 W. The pressure of the chamber is 2 mTorr. The temperature of the bottom electrode table is 30°C. The pressure of the He backing is 10 Torr. The time for etching is 2 min 30 s. In the process of dry-etching, the silica substrate will also get etched as shown in <a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>A and 5B. The rough surface (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C) of the silica substrate will strongly scatter light, significantly reducing the visible transmittance. Therefore, we do not recommend this dry-etching technology. Perhaps improved results can be obtained but optimization of this dry-etching technology is out of the scope for this work.</div>

<p>The prepared sample is transparent for visible light as shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>A and it has a 2D array of apertures, as shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>B. Under normal incidence, the measured <i>T</i><sub>dh</sub> reaches 0.9 and the measured <i>T</i><sub>ds</sub> reaches 0.8, as shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>C. The measured infrared reflectance and transmittance are shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>D. The measured transmittance in 3–14 <i>μ</i>m is nearly 0, indicating the sum of emittance and reflectance is ∼1. In 3–5 <i>μ</i>m, the reflectance reaches 0.65 (i.e., emittance=0.35). In 8–14 <i>μ</i>m, the reflectance reaches 0.86 (i.e., emittance=0.14). With these low emittances, the sample can be applied for infrared camouflage. In 5–8 <i>μ</i>m, the reflectance can reach 0.18 (i.e., emittance=0.82), indicating a performance of heat dissipation by radiation.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol should be applied carefully as there are limitations. Based on the negative photoresist liftoff process in this protocol, a multi-layer film with designed apertures can be prepared. However, when the scale of the aperture changes, this protocol may be ineffective. For example, when the aperture is smaller, the processed Cr mask may not get prepared through the maskless lithograph system (step 1) and the exposed photoresist may not get stripped from the substrate with the nearby film existing well (step 23). The operating parameters (e.g., power and time, etc.) for the equipment (e.g., ATD 1500 and SUSS MA6, etc.) in this protocol may be not applicable for other equipment with similar function. Due to the limitation of the equipment, the optical properties of the photonic sample at a higher temperature (&gt;25°C) cannot be measured to investigate the influence of temperature on the performance of this photonic sample.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>An important step is to strip the exposed photoresist on the substrate (step 23) with the nearby film existing well using ultrasonic bath. However, the exposed photoresist is not easy to be stripped from the substrate and the ZnO/Ag/ZnO film will delaminate from the substrate in an ultrasonic bath as well. If the ultrasonic bath time is not enough, the photoresist may be not cleanly stripped, as shown in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A. The region 1 in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A shows the remaining photoresist. On the other hand, if the ultrasonic time is too long, the film will delaminate from the substrate, causing the fabrication failed as well, as shown in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B. The region 4 shows the remaining film and the region 5 is the aperture with no exposed photoresist. The region between the remaining film (i.e., 4) and the aperture (i.e., 5) should be the deposited film. (step 23)</p>

<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The substrate should be well cleaned to enhance the adhesion between the film and the substrate. The ultrasonic bath in step 23 is operated at 80°C to make the exposed photoresist easily be stripped. The bath time should be controlled carefully (e.g., 3 s one time) to make sure the ZnO/Ag/ZnO film is still adhered on the substrate with the exposed photoresist stripped gradually.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>As the Cr mask blank may be not perfect, the observed damages (e.g., bubbles in the photoresist layer on the mask) may cause the prepared mask inapplicable for next step, as shown in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A (region 2). (steps 1–5)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Expose a new Cr mask with the maskless lithograph system again.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>In Klayout, a circle will be approximated as an equilateral polygon. If the polygon has not enough sides, it will be out-of-round, as shown in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A (region 3). If the polygon has too many sides, the GDS file will be too large to be imported into the maskless lithograph system. (step 1)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Select an appropriate number for the sides of the equilateral polygon in Klayout (e.g., 16 sides in this protocol).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>When using the magnetron sputtering to prepare ZnO and Ag, the deposing rate may change as the pressure in the chamber and the operating condition of the system are not completely stable. (steps 19–21)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Calibrate the depositing rate of each material before conducting the deposition process.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>After deposition of Ag layer, the silver will get oxidized gradually which will influence the performances of the sample. After storage for a long time, the film will delaminate, as shown in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>C. According to the observation of an infrared camera, the edge of one sample is damaged. (steps 24 and 25)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The photonic sample should not be stored for a long time before conducting the other experiments. The temperature of the photonic sample is controlled below 180°C which is safe for silver temporarily (<a href="#bib9">Reddy et al., 2017</a>).</p>
