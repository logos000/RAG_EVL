<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Immune cells, such as macrophages, reprogram their lipid metabolism in response to the activation of pattern recognition receptors (e.g., TLRs, NLRs) and cytokine receptors (e.g., interferons, interleukins). Profiling these changes can be achieved with shotgun mass spectrometry. This protocol provides step-by-step instructions on the generation and stimulation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), sample collection, and lipid extraction for profiling the macrophage lipidome.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Hsieh et al. (2020</a>).</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>A lipidomics experiment with BMDMs takes approximately two weeks to complete. As such, preparation of all the necessary reagents and equipment is important for success. A full list of reagents is provided in the <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a>, with every reagent (including the plasticwares and the serum) tested experimentally to maximize quality and reproducibility (see Figure S1 in <a href="#bib2">Hsieh et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Macrophages are highly sensitive to the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major source of contamination. Unwanted activation of naïve macrophage during differentiation will negatively impact cell differentiation, morphology, and lipid composition. It is highly recommended to clean and disinfect Class II biological safety cabinets every time prior to a macrophage lipidomics experiment. Likewise, CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator should be cleaned and disinfected every four months to reduce the likelihood of cross-contamination.</p>
<p>Contamination of reagents (e.g., fetal bovine serum (FBS) and M-CSF containing conditioned media) by mycoplasma or endotoxin will negatively impact macrophage experiments. As such, routine testing of reagents is recommended.</p>
<p>Reagent quality (e.g., solvents, water) is important to reduce the chance of contamination from external fatty acid sources. The use of pre-made solutions is recommended.</p>

<h3 id="sec2.1">Equipment</h3>
<h4 id="sec2.1.1">Imaging device for cell count</h4>
<p>In this protocol, live cell count was assessed using Calcein-AM staining and imaged with a ImageXpress XL instrument (Molecular Devices). Calcein-AM staining for live cell count is compatible with other imaging systems, including Operetta imaging system (PerkinElmer) (tested by the author) and IncuCyte Live Cell Imaging (Sartorius).</p>
<h4 id="sec2.1.2">Lipidyzer</h4>
<p>The Sciex Lipidyzer platform consists of a QTRAP 5500 with SelexION Ion Mobility Technology and a Shimadzu Nexera X2 system consisting of a controller (CMB-20A), two HPLC pumps (LC-30AD), autosampler (SIL-30AC), and column oven (CTO-20A). The pumps are configured to run an isocratic running solution (1× running solution). The autosampler is configured for a 50 μL infusion. This system is control by Analyst software (version 1.6.3) and the Lipidyzer Workflow Manager (version 1.0). This software supervises the running of methods to tune the SelexIon device, test system functioning, acquire data from samples in two successive direction infusion methods, and analyze the resulting data. The Lipidyzer measures 1,070 lipid species from 13 lipid classes.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Dichloromethane is harmful if swallowed and/or inhaled, and can cause eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation. This substance has caused adverse reproductive and fetal effects in animals. This chemical must be handled a chemical fume hood. As stated in the MSDS, methylene chloride is metabolically converted to carbon monoxide after systemic absorption, which yields increased concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood. As stated in the MSDS, methanol is poisonous and flammable. Ingestion may be fatal or cause blindness. It causes eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritation. May cause central nervous system depression. Cannot be made non-poisonous.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Murine M-CSF containing conditioned media can be generated by collecting the spent medium after culture of CMG14-12 or L929. Recombinant M-CSF can also be used to induce macrophage differentiation. The Sciex Lipidyzer Platform Mixture (containing undiluted internal standards) is designed to work exclusively with the Lipidyzer Internal Standard. The Lipidyzer Internal Standard Mixture is a master mix comprised of 13 lipid classes and includes labeled molecular species for each class. When using other direct infusion mass spec platform, user should select appropriate internal standards to that platform and to the quality of quantification requirement. Two potential alternative standard mixture are SPLASH LIPIDOMIX Mass Spec Standard and UltimateSPLASH ONE LIPIDOMIX Standards from Avanti Polar Lipids. Both alternatives are listed in the <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a>.</div>

<p>This section covers the differentiation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs).</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a clean workbench with an isoflurane chamber, dissection tray (a piece of polystyrene foam covered with aluminum foil), and two beakers containing water and 70% ethanol (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A). Clean all the tools with 70% ethanol (EtOH). Place a 50 mL centrifuge tube on a rack and filled with 30 mL of ice-cold PBS for bone collection.

</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Sacrifice mice in prepared isoflurane containing chamber (5% isoflurane concentration) with lid covered for about 5 min. An appropriate alternative method is euthanasia by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation. In both cases, cervical dislocation may be used as a secondary means to assure the death of the animal. Assess the death of the animal by and lack of lack of heartbeat and by pedal reflex (firm toe pinch). Sacrificing and assessing the death of the animal should follow ethical guidelines as published by individual institution. Spray the deceased animal with 70% EtOH and place in dissection tray. Secure limbs to tray with 25G x 5/8 inch needles (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B).</li>
<li>The skin, fur, and muscle are removed first to facilitate the bone collection. Isolate the femur and tibia using a pair of tweezers and scissor. Use tweezers to grasp bone, and if necessary, cut away excess tissue from around the ends of the bone. Avoid cutting or breaking the femurs. Cut down each leg along the separated skin with the foot still attached to the leg (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C). Remove the foot and place the leg in the PBS-filled centrifuge tube (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D).</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Breaking the bones during this stage of isolation will expose sterile bone marrow to the open air. This will increase the chance of bone marrow losses and contamination.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Inside the tissue culture hood, fill a 10 mL syringe with 10 mL of ice-cold PBS and attach a 26G x 5/8 inch needle. One syringe per leg is recommended for maximum bone marrow recovery (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E). Place the legs on a sterile 10 cm tissue culture dish. It will be necessary to cut the distal end of the tibia in order to flush the marrow.</li>
<li>Place the isolated femur and tibia on a separate 10 cm tissue culture dish (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>F).</li>
<li>Place a 40 μM cell strainer on a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Pierce bone at the ends with syringe and flush bone with PBS into the cell strainer (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>G). Bones should be flushed until they become a translucent white color. Each bone should require between 3 – 5 mL of PBS.</li>
<li>Rinse the cell strainer with 5 mL of ice-cold PBS for maximum bone marrow recovery.</li>
<li>Spin down the bone marrow at 365 × <i>g</i> for 7 min at room temperature (RT, 20°C) and aspirate off the PBS (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>H).</li>
<li>Resuspend the bone marrow in 3 mL of red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (see <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a>) and place at RT for 3 min. Neutralize the RBC lysis buffer by adding 7 mL of ice-cold PBS.</li>
<li>Spin down the bone marrow at 365 × <i>g</i> for 5 min at RT.</li>
<li>Aspirate off the PBS and resuspend the bone marrow in 20 mL of BMDM medium for cell counting. Use a hematocytometer or an automated cell counter to determine the number of live macrophages. Cells can be stained with trypan blue for cell counting with a hematocytometer. Live cell count can be assessed with an automated cell counter using the acridine orange (AO) and propidium iodide (PI) dyes.</li>
<li>To prevent macrophages from overgrowing by day 6 of differentiation, seed 16 – 20 million monocyte precursors per 15 cm tissue culture-treated culture dishes for differentiation (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A). Add 25 mL of macrophage media per dish.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This method can be used to examine how different immune stimuli (e.g., TLR agonists or cytokines) reprogram macrophage lipid metabolism. Downstream bioinformatic analysis — using for instance, heatmaps and PCA analysis (<a href="#bib2">Hsieh et al., 2020</a>) — will allow the user to identify lipid species of interests for further investigation.</p>
<p>The Lipidyzer platform was originally designed to measure composition of complex lipids using 100 μL of plasma or serum (<a href="#bib5">Sciex, 2016</a>; <a href="#bib7">Ubhi, 2018</a>). The results displayed by the Lipidyzer has an embedded 10× multiplier to the lipid content measured (e.g., conversion of nmoles of lipids per 100 μL sample to nmoles of lipids/mL). To obtain usable data for macrophage and for other cell types, the lipid concentration from the output is first divided by a factor of 10 (e.g., XX nmoles becomes XX/10 nmol). This value is subsequently divided by the live cell number and scaled up to 10<sup>7</sup> cells (e.g., XX nmol / cell count X 10<sup>7</sup>). This calculation must be carried out for all “Concentration” data sets reported by the Lipidyzer.</p>
<p><a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> provides a simplified example of Lipidyzer results generated from a macrophage shotgun lipidomics experiment. There are 6 data sheet tabs in total, with the blue arrow illustrating the relationship between the tabs:</p>

<p><b>Lipid Species Concentration</b> details the nanomolar values of each lipid species measured in this experiment and are normalized to the cell number (i.e., reported as XX nmoles per 10<sup>7</sup> macrophages). All subsequent tables can be mathematically derived from the <b>Lipid Species Concentration</b>.</p>
<p><b>Fatty Acid Concentration</b> details the sum of a specific acyl tail (i.e., nmol of 16:0 FA per 10<sup>7</sup> macrophages) measured within a lipid class. These values are normalized to the cell number and have the same units as <b>Species Normalization.</b></p>
<p><b>Lipid Class Concentration</b> details the sum of all lipid species within a lipid class (i.e., nmoles of phosphatidylcholine [PC] per 10<sup>7</sup> macrophages). These values also have the same units as <b>Species Normalization</b>.</p>
<p>In <b>Species Composition</b>, each lipid species (e.g., CER [14:0]) within a lipid class (e.g., class ceramides) is calculated as a percentage of the total lipid in the class. This calculation is not dependent on normalization to sample size and can be useful when normalization values are uncertain (e.g., due to inaccurate cell count). This also allows comparison between species within the same class.</p>
<p>In <b>Fatty Acid Composition,</b> the sum of lipids within a class that contain a specific fatty acid acyl tail (e.g., DAG [16:0]) and calculated as a percentage of the total lipid in the class (e.g., DAG).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol details the profiling of the macrophage lipidome using the direct infusion shotgun mass spectrometry on the Lipidyzer platform. While the sample preparation method could be utilized with other mass spectrometry platforms, this change might require modifications to the amount of sample needed and the running buffers used.</p>
<p>Mass spectrometry (MS)-based “shotgun lipidomics” can provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of the complex lipids in a biological system. The strengths and limitations of this technology have been extensively reviewed (<a href="#bib3">Hsu, 2018</a>). From our experience, the greatest strength of a shotgun lipidomics workflow is highly quantitative measurements facilitated by the simultaneous measurement of analytes and standards during direct infusion. The differential elution of analytes and standards during a conventional LC-MS runs result in poor quantification as ionization efficiency varies due to the solvent gradient and inconsistent ion suppression. The Lipidyzer platform leverages this strength with an extensive standard set for the best possible quantitative measurements. The limitation of this shotgun lipidomics workflow is that low abundance lipid species will not be detected due to high ion suppression in direct infusion. To compensate for this limitation, we use a higher amount of starting material (e.g., a higher cell number); 3 to 4 million of BMDMs per replicated is required to achieve the sensitivity illustrated in (<a href="#bib2">Hsieh et al., 2020</a>). A LC-MS based approach might be more suitable to detect a low abundance lipid species with less starting material.</p>
<p>Lipid extraction methods can also influence detection efficiencies of lipid species. The Bligh and Dyer extraction has been shown to efficiently and consistently extract all major lipid classes, including phospholipids and glycerol lipid classes. However, measurement of low abundant lipid species, such as oxysterols, is incompatible with this a general lipid extraction protocol. This analysis would require a more specific extraction such as neutral lipid extraction (<a href="#bib6">Tsui et al., 2019</a>), or solid phase extraction (<a href="#bib4">Meriwether et al., 2016</a>), in conjunction with a targeted LC-MS analysis.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem</h3>
<p>Low bone marrow yield.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Increase the number of animal usage. In our experience, an animal (C57BL6, male, between 8 and 12 weeks of age) should yield between 40 to 50 million progenitor cells. Minimum of two animals per experiment is recommended.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem</h3>
<p>Low macrophage yield at day 6 of differentiation.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>In our experience, an animal (C57BL6, male, between 8 and 12 weeks of age) should yield between 50 to 80 million BMDMs by day 6 of differentiation. A low yield can either due to environmental contamination as mentioned in the introduction or a low concentration of M-CSF in the growth media. Increasing the percentage volume of macrophage conditioned media (from 5% to 20% in some studies) or switching to recombinant M-CSF would improve the yield.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem</h3>
<p>Poor cell count or large deviation of cell counts between replicates.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This issue is primarily associated with poor plating of cells. Prior to executing step 16, pipette the cell suspension 5 to 10 times to ensure cell dissociate. Use a pipette instead of a pipette-aid when plating will reduce deviation between replicates.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem</h3>
<p>On step 31, over mixing/vortexing of sample, water, methanol, and dichloromethane will lead to poor phase partitioning, reducing extraction efficiencies (see <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D right tube).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Do not over mix the solution. Reduce the amount of bilayer extracted (step 35) to increase sample purity.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem</h3>
<p>On step 35, formation of thick aggregates (a cake layer) due to too much starting material, resulted in poor phase separations and extract purity (see <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D middle tube).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This issue is primarily associated with extraction of lipids from tissues or a large quantity of serum, rather than from cells. Reducing the amount of organic layer extracted in step 35 will improve sample purity. Increase the amount of dichloromethane in step 36 will allow a larger volume of organic layer to be extracted.</p>
