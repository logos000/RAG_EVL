<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Here, we present a spatially resolved sampling protocol for the oral human cavity aimed at untargeted metabolomics. We describe the spatial collection of salivary biospecimens, their preparation, and subsequent mass-spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics analysis. Our protocol avoids complex procedures generally required for gland-specific saliva collection. For the human oral cavity, we provide an easy, flexible, and reproducible solution to comprehensively map the highly heterogeneous environment and elucidate the functionality of salivary components.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00708-5/sref1">Ciurli et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The presented protocol has been developed for collecting spatially resolved saliva samples. Oral samples are collected from specific, anatomically defined oral locations, namely: cheek, above the tongue and below the tongue. These oral locations are characterized by presence of anatomical borders, teeth and tongue, and the unique combinations of salivary glands. Tongue and palate minor glands are the main source of saliva for above the tongue; submandibular- , sublingual glands, and tongue minor glands are the main glands for below the tongue whereas parotid glands, and cheeks minor glands are the main contributors of saliva for cheeks. The presented protocols can principally be carried out by a third person or the donor him/herself making it ideally suited for (remote)self-sampling. Moreover, the presented spatial sampling procedure should principally be applicable to other specimens such as blister fluid, tears, or wound secretions. Sugi® Eyespear (blunt tip) is the swab selected for a spatially resolved sampling of saliva. The choice has been made after a careful and systemic evaluation, where Sugi® Eyespear has shown a reproducible volume recovery, low background contamination as well as the high coverage and reproducible molecular feature recoveries (<a href="#bib1">Ciurli et al., 2021</a>).</p>

<p>A successful sampling should allow a collection of 75–250 μL of saliva per sample, depending on the oral location, time of sampling and intra-subject variability. <i>Above the tongue</i> samples display the lowest saliva content ranging from 75 to 150 μL, whereas below the tongue is the location with the highest saliva content between 150–250 μL can be collected. LC-MS analysis of spatially resolved saliva samples should result in distinct clusters based on the oral location of origin (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>), characteristic patterns of analyte distribution among the locations (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>) and detection of unique analytes (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).

The heatmap was generated using the spatially resolved samples and labelled based on the location of collection (AT = above the tongue, BT = below the tongue and CC = cheeks). Data are centered, UV scaled and log10 transformed (AT n = 8, BT n = 8 and CC n = 11).</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>Spectra deconvolution and peak alignment can be performed using MS-DIAL (version 4.20) (<a href="#bib2">Tsugawa et al., 2015</a>). A detailed description of all applied parameters is shown in <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>. Peaks are considered when present in all replicates of the same sample type. All detected features are validated as follows. (1) In order to remove features which are not sample related, a background threshold (BgT) is computed using an aqueous control sample (worked up LC-MS water sample) (BgT = mean (control_group (peak_area)) + sd (control_group (peak_area)) × 3) (n = 5), consequently every value equal or below the threshold is defined as missing value, (2) features that are not detected in all biological replicates of the reference group are excluded from further analysis. (3) In addition, to evaluate the reproducibility of the measurements, a relative standard deviation (RSD) is calculated for all features detected in the QC pool group (RSD = sd (QCpool_group (peak_area))/mean (QCpool_group (peak_area)) × 100), and consequently a 20 % cut off is applied and any feature characterized by RSD &gt; 20 % is excluded for further analysis.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The presented protocol describes a facile, versatile and reproducible sample collection method for untargeted metabolic profiling of saliva in a spatially resolved fashion. If the protocol is being used for other bodily fluids, e.g., tears, blisters, or wound fluid a brief validation of the protocol for these purposes should be considered. Moreover, we have not developed the protocol for quantitative analysis. In other words, if the protocol is being applied for the targeted analysis of specific metabolites a dedicated validation procedure must be performed. Also, when the protocol is used for sampling specific disease areas, data normalization should be considered. This can be achieved by different approaches for example total area normalization as well as normalization based on collected area or volume. Ultimately, each study has its own limitations and requirements and the suitability of our protocol for specific purposes should be investigated on an individual basis.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Missing samples.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution 1</h3>
<p>In order to avoid missing samples, we suggest to centrifuge each storage tube before freezing (<i>cf</i> <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> - step 8), with the aim of knowing ahead the number of missing samples by visual inspection. Subsequently, sample collection can be repeated with the same subjects whose samples are missing, when possible, or recruiting new subjects up to the desired number of samples.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Low volume of saliva collected.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution 2</h3>
<p>When the minimum volume of saliva do not reach the necessary volume for the LC-MS/MS analysis (HILIC = 25 μL, RP = 40 μL), the volume collected can be increased by applying mechanical stimulation through gentle brushing of the oral location of interest prior the absorption time, increasing the absorption time (<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> - step 3) or both.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Saliva samples contaminated with blood.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution 3</h3>
<p>The presence of blood profoundly alters the profile of the biological sample collected and constitutes a serious confounding factor during data analysis. Make sure to exclude subjects with gum bleeding or poor oral hygiene by using strict exclusion and inclusion criteria.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Altered saliva profile.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution 4</h3>
<p>Exogenous compounds, such as foods and drugs, might have a large influence on the metabolomic profile of saliva. In order to identify the source of changes, we suggest the use of a questionnaire to annotate food and drugs intake of the study subjects or, alternatively, to prevent alteration of the metabolomic profile, drugs intake might be added into the exclusion criteria whereas stricter sampling precautions might be implemented to avoid alteration caused by food intake, e.g., 12 h overnight fasting (<a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> - step 1).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>High variance in results.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution 5</h3>
<p>In our experience, the saliva composition is largely influenced by the circadian rhythm. As a result, sampling donors at the same time of the day can effectively reduce the variance of the analysis results.</p>
