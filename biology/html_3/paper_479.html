<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol describes stable <i>in vivo</i> recordings of neuronal membrane potential in awake behaving, head-fixed mice. Previous protocols often highlight the need to minimize animal movements by anesthesia or restraint. This protocol is optimized to minimize brain movements during animal motion and has been used to record neurons in the olfactory bulb and visual cortex during active licking and locomotion behaviors. Under optimal conditions, success rates lie between 30% and 50% (recordings per microelectrode), with durations of up to 30 min.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Jordan et al. (2018)</a> and <a href="#bib1">Jordan and Keller (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Before attempting whole-cell recordings in behaving animals, a recording rig must be prepared with the following essential elements (example products in <a href="#materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>A typical denoized whole-cell recording system, consisting of a patch-clamp amplifier, head stage, microelectrode holder, 4-axis micromanipulators, oscilloscope, and a 20 kHz (or more) data acquisition device and software.</li>
<li>A rigid head-fixation system, with the parts connecting to the head plate ideally electrically isolated from the grounding point.</li>
<li>A stereoscope for visual targeting of the micropipette to the craniotomy.</li>
<li>A custom micropipette pressure system with digital pressure sensors for rapid optimization and reliable repetition of the protocol (e.g., design in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).
<figure id="fig1"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/479-Fig1.jpg" alt="Fig1.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 1. Electronic micropipette pressure system design</div>
<p>(A) Front panel of the valve box, with digital pressure sensors for both high-pressure and low-pressure lines. Valves and connections are housed within this box. Left shows the remote for controlling for the valves. The two metal switches control each two-way valve to lock pressure into each line independently, while the red switch controls the three-way valve to switch between high- and low-pressure lines connecting to the micropipette tubing.</p>
<p>(B) Schematic of the system, with the low-pressure line in blue and high-pressure line in pink. Arrows show connections via 4–5 mm diameter tubing. Note that the pipette tip connected to the low-pressure line is for mouth control of the pressure. Pressure range shown in sensors indicates the expected range of values experienced for each line.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>A treadmill, running wheel, or air-supported ball to allow smooth locomotion and comfortable animal posture. Some “give” in the locomotion apparatus is essential, so that the animal cannot exert strong forces against the headplate implant.</li>
<li>A puller program must also be optimized to generate 5–7 MΩ micropipettes. An example of an optimized micropipette shape is shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.

Ideal microelectrode tip diameter should be roughly 1 μm, corresponding to 5–7 MΩ resistance. A relatively long shank and rounded tip are ideal for patching <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Test the setup</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> up to 3 weeks</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Test the pressure control system.
<ol type="a">
<li>Assemble the pressure control system as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.</li>
<li>Assess the low- and high-pressure lines. Load an empty micropipette onto the head stage, add 1 bar pressure (100 mbar for testing low-pressure line) and lock the pressure in. After 5 min, assess how much pressure is lost. In an adequately air-tight system, no more than 5% should be lost.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ensure the system enables whole-cell recordings in anesthetized mice.
<ol type="a">
<li>Perform steps 1–9 (Implantation of head plate) and steps 15–22 (Craniotomy and durectomy) of the main protocol consecutively, under general injection anesthesia (e.g., ketamine/xylazine).</li>
<li>Transfer the anesthetized mouse to the electrophysiology rig and maintain body heat there using a heat-pad.</li>
<li>Attempt whole-cell recordings as outlined in steps 24–40 (Whole-cell recordings) of the main protocol, while monitoring and maintaining anesthesia.</li>
<li>Via successive rounds of improvement (see <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>), increase success rates of obtaining a stable (&gt; 10 min duration) whole-cell recording up to 30%–50% (recordings per micropipette descended).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Implantation of head plate</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>The aim of this step is to implant a headplate for head fixation in a manner which minimizes brain movement. Note that strict sterile procedures must be adhered to in order to prevent infections. Mice should ideally be 5–6 weeks old at the start of the protocol for optimal recording success. Both male and female mice have been used successfully. The age of the mouse at the time of patching should be no greater than 12 weeks. In older animals, the chances of obtaining a recording drop, and access resistances of successful recordings tend to be higher, likely due to changes in the properties of the tissue and increases in bone thickness making the craniotomy more difficult to achieve cleanly.</p>
<p>See <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> for a graphical demonstration of this stage.</p>

<li>Prepare enough micropipettes for the recording session (around 10–12), as well as a means of filling them (e.g., a syringe with a thin tapered tip filled with 250 μL intracellular solution, kept on ice).</li>
<li>Prepare 4% low melting point agar (dissolved in bath recording solution) and maintain in a heat bath at 60°C.</li>
<li>Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane, as before (3% for induction, 1.5% for maintenance), and head fix the mouse at the surgery station on a heated pad to maintain body temperature.</li>
<li>Inject a general analgesic (e.g., Metacam, buprenorphine).</li>
<li>Perform a small circular craniotomy, around 1 mm in diameter over the site of interest.
<ol type="a">
<li>Remove the silicone covering the bone.</li>
<li>Drill the edge of the circle slowly, regularly pausing to irrigate the bone with cold bath recording solution. Dry the bone thoroughly before resuming drilling, and clear away bone particles to prevent contamination of the craniotomy.</li>
<li>Once the bone is thin enough, you will see the bone circle move when lightly pressed with forceps (check this while the bone is damp).</li>
<li>Use a 20-gauge needle, or fine forceps, to lift and remove the bone circle from the skull, while immersed in recording solution. Make sure that at no point the brain is touched by your instrument, and that the brain does not contact air (this can cause sticking of the dura to the brain surface, making it hard to remove cleanly).</li>
<li>Use a syringe to lightly wash the brain with recording solution until any small bleeds have stopped.</li>

<ol type="a">
<li>Abruptly tap a 30-gauge needle tip perpendicularly downwards onto a hard, clean surface. This should bend the needle tip to create a very small hook.</li>
<li>With the hook side facing down toward the brain, carefully attempt to catch onto the dura using a shallow angle (&lt;30°).</li>
<li>Once attached carefully tear and pull the dura to the side of the craniotomy with the hook, without touching the underlying brain surface directly. Remove as much dura as possible from the center of the craniotomy to provide ample space for electrode descent.</li>

<p>If neuronal morphology is desired, the following steps should also be followed during whole-cell recordings. Note that this will further limit the number of recordings obtained to one per mouse, to be sure of matching the morphology to the recording.

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 6. Retraction after neuronal filling for morphological reconstruction</div>
<p>Boxes 1–3 show electrode current signatures for a good chance of morphological recovery. After filling the neuron in whole-cell mode for 5–10 min, the pipette is slowly retracted before access resistance deteriorates. This evokes membrane resealing and formation of an outside-out patch on the electrode tip that is indicated by a high electrode resistance. Green coloration of the neuron in the diagram indicates intracellular solution that has diffused into the cytoplasm from the micropipette tip.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="41">
<li>Perform recordings as outlined in steps 24–38 (Whole-cell recordings), with an intracellular solution additionally containing 10 mM biocytin or neurobiotin. For a good neuronal fill, recording duration should be between 5 and 10 min, with an electrode resistance on the lower end of the workable range (5–6 MΩ), and an access resistance below 80 MΩ.</li>
<li>Retract the microelectrode slowly after 5–10 min of recording, while the recording quality is still high, and monitor the electrode current with a 10-mV test pulse in voltage clamp, as before. For a successful fill, microelectrode resistance should gradually increase as the microelectrode is retracted (at 5–10 μm/s, until resealing), reflecting the formation of an outside-out patch.</li>
<li>Once outside of the tissue and in the bath, applying a strong positive pressure to the micropipette should return the electrode resistance to close to its original value. This is an indicator of a good retraction that has retained minimal cellular material in/on the micropipette.</li>
<li>Fix the brain with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) within an hour of recording via transcardial perfusion and store the brain for 24 h in 4% PFA.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>In optimal conditions, this protocol allows whole-cell recording success rates between 30% and 50% of descended micropipettes. Of the successful recordings, usable recording time typically is between 3 and 30 min (mean ± standard deviation: 14 ± 4 min), with minimal changes in access resistances during a variety of mouse movements (see <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> and <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>).</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 7. Example traces of stable recordings during different mouse behaviors</div>
<p>Example membrane voltage traces (black) recorded from a putative mitral neuron in the olfactory bulb (top trace, adapted from <a href="#bib2">Jordan et al., 2018</a>) and a putative pyramidal neuron in layer 2/3 of primary visual cortex (bottom trace, adapted from <a href="#bib1">Jordan and Keller, 2020</a>), during different behaviors: licking in a task and locomotion in virtual reality, respectively.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the start of the recording, access resistances are around 41 ± 18 MΩ (mean ± standard deviation) in putative principal neurons of the olfactory bulb (<a href="#bib2">Jordan et al., 2018</a>) and 56 ± 21 MΩ in putative pyramidal neurons in V1 (<a href="#bib1">Jordan and Keller, 2020</a>). Access resistance does tend to gradually increase and therefore should be carefully monitored throughout the recording. If access resistance increases beyond acceptable levels, the experimenter may attempt to “re-open” the patch the same way one would enter whole-cell mode initially. However, in many cases this leads to loss of the recording.</p>
<p>In my experience, up to around 12 micropipettes can be descended into a 1 mm craniotomy, because success rates tend to drop with consecutive descents and are very low beyond 12. This is likely due to damage to the tissue with consecutive descents. If the targeted area is not too small, and the stereotactic coordinates of the descent are not too critical (e.g., in the olfactory bulb, which is anatomically rather isolated from other regions), one can attempt to visually target each electrode to different regions of the craniotomy. It is generally a good idea to vary the X-Y coordinates by around 50–100 μm with each descent, to avoid descending in the very same area. One must also keep in mind the length of time that mice can be kept comfortably head fixed and show the relevant behavior – for rewarded tasks this may be lower due to eventual satiation, while for spontaneous behaviors like locomotion, this will depend on the individual mouse, and the length of training time. Typically, one can record between one and three neurons per animal, however in a subset of mice conditions may be too poor to make whole-cell recordings that are stable during movement (5%–10% of mice).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>While brain motion caused by animal movement will be minimized using the steps outlined in this protocol, it is often not possible to eliminate motion entirely. This means that there will often be slow changes in access resistance which should be carefully monitored so that data can be excluded if this gets too high or variable. This also means that recording durations will be limited, with usable traces ranging between 3 and 30 min in duration.</p>
<p>If the experimental question necessitates quantifying changes over time (e.g., learning-related changes), control animals should also be used to assess the effects of changes due to intracellular solution dialysis or increases in access resistance.</p>
<p>Due to the need for a clean brain surface with minimal regrowth and bleeding, recordings are performed within 2 h of the craniotomy and durectomy surgery. Due to the invasiveness of this surgery, anesthesia and analgesia must be applied to the animal. While isoflurane has been chosen due to its short half-life and rapid behavioral recovery, it is possible that the anesthesia or analgesic drugs could affect some aspects of neuronal or network physiology, which should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.</p>
<p>It must also be noted that in the awake animal (compared to anesthetized and <i>in vitro</i> recordings), access resistances will typically be higher and more variable, while input resistances are typically very low (putative mitral and tufted neurons: 58 ± 32 MΩ (mean ± standard deviation), putative pyramidal neurons: 42 ± 20 MΩ). This creates highly suboptimal conditions for voltage clamp due to space clamp errors (<a href="#bib6">Williams and Mitchell, 2008</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1: Unstable electrical signals during descent through the bath solution (step 26)</h3>
<p>If you see large changes in the electrode offset as you move the micropipette through the recording solution, the recording chamber is unlikely to be electrically isolated.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Look for gaps in the dental cement where the recording solution may be contacting the metal headplate and creating a path to ground. Electrically isolating the entire head fixation apparatus, e.g., using PEEK instead of metal headplates or headplate holders, can also help prevent this.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2: Micropipette resistance increases after descent into tissue (step 31)</h3>
<p>If the resistance of the micropipette increases between the recording chamber and the entry into the tissue, detecting a hit with a neuron and obtaining a recording will be very difficult. This is likely due to a lack of clean entry into the tissue.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This could be due to a lack of high enough pressure during the initial descent. Try increasing the descent pressure by 100 mbar at a time. Make sure the pipette pressure system is not leaking.</p>
<p>Make sure the dura is well cleared from the center of the craniotomy prior to attempting recording. Visually guide the micropipette descent to avoid superficial blood vessels. Check for bleeds on the brain surface. If there are no large clean areas to target the micropipette, obtaining a recording will be extremely difficult – at this point it is best to terminate the experiment.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3: Inability to detect neuronal hits (step 33)</h3>
<p>Sometimes micropipette resistance is unchanged after descent, but collisions with neurons are hard or impossible to detect.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>(A) This could be due either to too low or too high search pressure during “neuron hunting”: if the micropipette resistance changes often during stepping, but neuron hits are not obvious, try increasing the search pressure by 5 mbar each time. If micropipette resistance barely ever shows a change during stepping, try reducing the search pressure by 5 mbar each time.</p>
<p>(B) Depending on the structure being targeted, altering the descent angle may aid in increasing the chances of a clean somatic hit.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4: Inability to obtain a GΩ seal (step 34)</h3>
<p>In some cases, you can detect a neuronal hit, but it is difficult to obtain a GΩ resistance seal.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Common causes for this problem are:</p>
<p>First, the micropipette tip is getting contaminated during descent (a clean glass surface is crucial to sealing). For this, see potential solutions to Problem 2.</p>
<p>Second, the pressure system is not performing well. Make sure that there are no leaks or blockages in the pressure system, and that fast step changes in pressure can be achieved. This can be checked by loading an empty micropipette, breaking the tip and applying changes in pressure while immersed in solution – you should be able to control the rate of bubbles coming out of the pipette tip on a fast timescale.</p>
<p>Third, the micropipette resistance is too low (&lt; 5 MΩ). Make micropipettes with resistances of 5–7 MΩ.</p>
<p>Finally, the micropipette tip shape is suboptimal. A somewhat rounded tip, as shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, is ideal.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5: Inability to break in after GΩ seal formation (step 37)</h3>
<p>Sometimes it will be possible to get a GΩ resistance seal onto a cell, but it will not be possible to break in despite repeated attempts.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is usually due to the micropipette resistance being too high (i.e., the tip diameter is too narrow). Make lower resistance micropipettes (5–7 MΩ).</p>
<p>Sometimes you will seal onto something other than a neuron, for example a blood vessel. Watch the current trace for characteristic features of hitting a neuron, such as a mild oscillation on top of the current step. Hitting blood vessels (or other non-neural structures) often looks subtly different.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6: Sudden increase of access resistance or loss of recording (step 38)</h3>
<p>Slow increases in access resistance are common in awake recordings and cannot be fully prevented. However, sudden increases, or sudden losses of the recording altogether (e.g., <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>), especially if frequent, usually indicate significant mechanical instability.</p>
<figure id="fig8"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/479-Fig8.jpg" alt="Fig8.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 8. Example loss of high-quality olfactory bulb recording during mouse movement</div>
<p>Dotted line indicates 0 mV.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure to carefully replace the 4% agar layer every 1–2 pipette descents, as gradual break down of this layer will allow the brain to move.</p>
<p>Check that all parts of the head-fixation apparatus are rigid and there are no loose screws.</p>
<p>If this occurs more than once in the same animal, and the head-fixation apparatus appears rigid, this is unlikely to be fixable and the experiment should be terminated. After euthanizing the animal, check for any instabilities in the headplate (for example, gaps between cement and bone, which are often caused by incomplete removal and regrowth of the periosteum).</p>
<p>Repeated, sudden increases in access resistance can also be caused if there are clogging particles in the intracellular solution. This can often be determined by applying suction to the micropipette – if the electrode resistance drops when negative pressure is applied, and increases when the positive pressure is applied, this is due to a blockage within the micropipette tip. Check the failed micropipette under a light microscope to look for particulates. Potential culprits include dusty glass capillaries or improperly filtered intracellular solution.</p>
