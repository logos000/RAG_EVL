<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A cornea is innervated by sensory nerves, which branch into thick trunks, subbasal plexuses, and sensory endings. Appropriate assessment of nerve structure in a tissue provides a more complete understanding of the role of nerves in health and disease. Here, we present a whole-mount immunohistochemistry protocol that facilitates evaluation of nerve architecture throughout the mouse cornea. The fixation step in this protocol allows for reliable detection of nerve structures within the cornea and likely other tissues.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Yun et al, (2020)</a>.</p>

<li>Briefly but thoroughly wash the enucleated mouse eyes with cold 1<b>×</b> PBS, and immediately immerse the eyes into 1.7 mL Eppendorf tubes with at least 200 μL 1.3% PFA in 1<b>×</b> PBS. Keep the tubes at 20°C–25°C for 1 h.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Fixing eyes immediately after enucleation prevents nerve degradation, which is vital when staining the corneas with antibodies for anti-sensory neurotrophic factors such as substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide CGRP. When the nerves are severed, the distal axon fragmentation is triggered within seconds, but immediate fixation after harvesting preserves the cornea nerves from degradation (<a href="#bib1">Stepp et al., 2017</a>). See <a href="#sec6.1">troubleshooting: problem 1</a>.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The concentration of PFA and the fixation time both affect the binding of antibodies. Increased concentration or fixation time cause patchy staining in the corneal epithelium and the epithelium-stroma interface, resulting in poor detection of sensory nerve endings (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) and nerve plexuses (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).

<p>Eyes of non-infected C57BL/6 mice that were 2–3 months old were enucleated and fixed with 1.3%, 2% and 4% PFA for 1 h, 2 h, 6 h and 1 day, respectively. The eyes were then washed with 1<b>×</b> PBS and the corneas were dissected, flat mounted and labeled with anti βIII Tubulin antibody (green) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). Images were acquired by confocal microscope and the brightness levels in the figures were adjusted for display. The cornea fixed with 1.3% PFA for 1 h demonstrated clear sensory endings in the epithelium level which can be identified by the morphology of DAPI staining in the nuclei. Higher PFA concentration and longer fixation led to high background and patchy staining and making it unable to illustrate the sensory nerve terminus.</p>

<p>In the exact frames illustrated in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, continuing to check the deeper z-stack layer for the staining of the nerve plexus located in the epithelial-stroma interface showed that 1.3% PFA with 1 h of fixation allowed the best revealing of the fine structure of nerve plexus. 2% PFA with 1 h of fixation or 1.3% PFA with 2 h of fixation reveals the majority of the nerve plexus. Higher PFA concentration and longer fixation led to partial to complete loss of the signal of the nerve plexus. (blue, DAPI; green, βIII Tubulin).</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The image of the whole nerve architecture spanning from the epithelium to the endothelium can be acquired via confocal microscope. In a healthy cornea, the sensory endings in the epithelium (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), the nerve plexus in the epithelium-stroma interface (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>), and the nerve trunks in the stroma are labeled with pan-neuronal marker βIII Tubulin. Under pathological conditions, sympathetic nerves that invade the cornea can be detected by anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody (<a href="#bib2">Yun et al., 2016</a>). The clean staining of the nerve fibers allows the quantification of nerve density. As mentioned above, nerves begin to deteriorate in a short period of time if the corneas are not fixed immediately, and the concentration of the fixation buffer as well as the fixation time both have critical impact on the staining. Aspects of this protocol likely extend to other tissues such as the skin where the intermingling of sensory, sympathetic, and parasympathetic nerves are more apparent. The fixing and whole mounting procedure described above preserves the nerve architecture more closely than previously described methods. The method we described should be employed to ensure proper delineation of specific nerve populations within peripheral tissues.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>For the quantification of corneal nerve density, representative corneal regions can be selected from each stitched volume. To ensure that the location of the selected regions is consistent in all corneas, a selection journal should be generated in MetaMorph 7.7.8 (Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, California, USA) or in Fiji. Define a consistent region size and copy representative areas from the peripheral cornea in each quadrant as well as the central area (for example, all regions located in the peripheral cornea 500 μm away from the limbus, and in the central cornea, with sampled regions each being 400<b>×</b>400 pixels):</p>
<p>To quantify the nerve density in a certain area:</p>
<ol>
<li>Save the spliced channels as 8-bit images.</li>
<li>Start the plugin from the Fiji Plugins › Segmentation › Simple Neurite Tracer menu option, Open the image in XY, ZY and XY view.</li>
<li>Choose to see a 3D representation of the tracings, and leave the Resampling factor as the default.</li>
<li>Enable cursor snapping within XY and Z.</li>
<li>Enable the option for using Hessian-based analysis of images.</li>
<li>Click on the point in the image stack where you want to start the tracing and then select the next point in the path, complete the path after picking out a few more points along the path.</li>
<li>Save the files with the original filename with the extension changed to “.traces”.</li>
<li>Select the paths from the path list and select “Fill Out Path(s)” in the interface.</li>
<li>Check Create Image Stack from Fill, and save the file of “filled neuron.” For a detailed walk-through of this plugin and how to adjust the fill threshold reference: <a href="https://imagej.net/SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions.html#II.Adjusting_the_Fill_Threshold">https://imagej.net/SNT:_Step-By-Step_Instructions.html#II.Adjusting_the_Fill_Threshold</a>
</li>
<li>Make sure to choose the file of “filled neuron,” then go to Fiji Plugins ›Skeleton ›Skeletonize.</li>
<li>Go to Fiji Plugins ›Skeleton ›Analyze Skeleton, choose the Prune cycle method and the Results and Output options.</li>
<li>Confirm the name of the original image which was analyzed</li>
<li>Save the Result file which provides the number of branches and the average and maximum length of branches in the corresponding units, and the file of Branch information which includes skeleton ID and calibrated branch length for further analysis.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol provides clean tissue/nerve staining for a single antibody; however, we have used this protocol to scan up to four different antibodies. In our experience, more than four combined antibodies will require a longer scanning time and may cause bleaching of the fluorescence, leading to false-negative staining.</p>
<p>The quantification of nerve density using Simple Neurite Tracer can only be completed manually, which is very time-consuming. We have found that different subsets of nerve markers degrade at different rates after sacrifice. Specifically, signals for sensory nerves are lost rather quickly compared to signals for sympathetic nerves. This speaks to the critical timing and nature of fixation after mouse sacrifice.</p>

<p>The time from sacrifice to fixation is critical as it has been reported (<a href="#bib1">Stepp et al., 2017</a>) that sensory endings begin to deteriorate within minutes of sacrifice. Therefore, one can reduce the time between sacrifice and fixation by only sacrificing one mouse at a time, becoming proficient at enucleating eyes(or other tissues), and having all tubes prepared in advance of sacrificing the mice. Furthermore, if the detection of sensory neurite markers is the priority of the designed experiment, try to stain corneas as soon as possible after fixation, and avoid using long stored samples.</p>
<p>Another potential solution could be to reduce the amount of time that corneas are exposed to confocal lasers. The sensory endings and nerve plexus are quite sensitive to bleaching, so limiting the number of analyzed parameters and ensuring that the epithelium is imaged first will help ensure appropriate analysis of sensory endings.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The nerve endings look patchy (<a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We recommend always using freshly diluted low concentrations of PFA to fix the eyes and keep the fixation time as short as possible (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a>). Our experiments showed that higher concentrations of PFA and longer fixation time cause high background and patchy staining in the epithelium, making it impossible to distinguish sensory endings. Moreover, the signal of nerve plexus in the epithelial-stroma interface gradually diminished and eventually turned off when the concentration of PFA and fixation time continually increased.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>There is high background in the confocal images (steps 9 and 11).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, one could try washing the cornea after dissection more thoroughly. Also, the serum used for the blocking buffers should be the same host species as the labeled secondary antibodies to decrease non-specific staining and high background. Through various optimization procedures, we have found that 30 min of blocking is the optimal blocking time. If blocking is done for less than 30 min, there is high background; however, longer blocking times can lead to a decreased signal.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Confocal images are mismatched after stitching and are obscured and curvy (<a href="#sec2.3">secondary antibody incubation- day 2</a>, step 17).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, check the settings before the mosaic scanning to make sure there is at least 10% overlap between each adjacent image. Second, the slides need to be dried out at least for 12 h before image acquisition. The undried mount medium will be pushed to the periphery under the cover slip when the oil objective moves toward the bottom of the slide during z stack scanning, thus the scanning depth will also change. These will affect the stitching and cause mismatch, and the images will be obscure and curvy.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Raw data are lost after stitching the mosaic scanned confocal images (<a href="#sec2.4">confocal microscopy acquisition - day 3</a>, steps 27 and 28).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, before acquiring the images, make sure to check the following saving options: 1, create a folder in data drive and save the individual scanning folder there; 2, check “Auto create sub folder every experiment”; 3, check “Add a time stamp”.</p>
<p>When stitching the images, make sure to save the file in the native OIB format and click the “Apply to Series” button and then click the save button, the stitched images should then be saved, and the raw individual images will be kept in the original folder.</p>
