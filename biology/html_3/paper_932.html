<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The visual system is the best system to study activity-dependent sensory circuit development. The connections from the retina to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, the retinogeniculate connections, undergo extensive remodeling during early postnatal life. Thus, techniques that allow the expression of transgenes early in the developing retina are essential to study visual system development. Here, we describe a protocol to express genes-of-interest in the developing mouse retina via <i>in utero</i> intraocular adeno-associated virus injections.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00449-4/sref6">Yasuda et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparation of pregnant mice</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> [13–16 days]</div>
<ol>
<li>Time mate mice or purchase time-mated females such that embryos will be embryonic day 13.5–15.5 (E13.5–E15.5) on the day of surgery.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Embryos can be injected up to E15.5 to ensure high and uniform viral expression in the newborn retina. However, we normally use E13.5 embryos. The eyes of older embryos (e.g., E15.5) are easier to inject, but it is more difficult to return the uterus to the abdominal cavity when embryos are older. Mice younger than E13.5 are smaller in size, thereby making the identification of the embryonic eye more difficult.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In <a href="#bib6">Yasuda et al. (2021)</a>, time-mated female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Upon arrival at Boston Children’s Hospital, pregnant female mice are singly housed and allowed to acclimate for at least 3 days prior to surgery. All animal care and experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Boston Children’s Hospital.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of AAV</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> [prior to surgery]</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Prepare AAV (serotype: DJ; titer: ~1×10<sup>12</sup> gc/mL) virus encoding the gene-of-interest.</li>
<li>Mix in the fast green dye such that the final concentration of dye is 0.1%.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We use the AAV-DJ serotype because of its rapid expression (<a href="#bib3">Lakhan et al., 2015</a>). See <a href="#limitations">limitations</a> below for the discussion on AAV serotypes. In <a href="#bib6">Yasuda et al. (2021)</a>, AAVs were generated by the Boston Children’s Hospital viral core and used in accordance with the Boston Children’s Hospital Institutional Biosafety Committee.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Preparation of surgical instruments</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> [1–2 days]</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Prepare glass micropipettes for injections.
<ol type="a">
<li>Pull borosilicate glass capillaries (1.0 mm outer diameter; 0.75 mm inner diameter; TW100-4; World Precision Instruments LLC., USA). We use a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Model P-1000; Sutter Instrument Co., USA). Micropipettes are pulled with the following setting: HEAT: Ramp+10; PULL: 30; VELOCITY: 120; TIME: 200; PRESSURE: 200.</li>
<li>Break the tip of the glass microcapillary with fine forceps to create a sharp angle tip with an outer diameter of 20–50 μm.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> A good microcapillary pipette is important for this protocol. We recommend preparing ~10 micropipettes of different tip sizes ranging from 20–50 μm. When choosing the micropipette, begin with the narrowest one. If loading the viral solution is difficult, use the next narrowest micropipette and so on until the virus solution loads smoothly. Since the thickness of the uterine wall varies between each pregnant female, narrow micropipettes may break during injection if the uterine wall is thick. If so, size up.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Sterilize all surgical instruments (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A) and glass micropipettes via autoclave or ethylene oxide gas.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>With AAV-DJ-CAG-EGFP, efficient viral transduction in the retina can be detected at P0. EGFP is highly expressed in the injected eye at P0 (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B). EGFP is uniformly expressed in the retina by P3, and the uniform expression persists at P15 (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>C). The cross section of the infected retina (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>D) shows that EGFP is highly expressed in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), where retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and displaced amacrine cells are located (72.9 ± 4.0% of cells in the GCL are EGFP positive). In the inner nuclear layer (INL), EGFP is highly expressed in horizontal cells and sparsely in amacrine cells and bipolar cells. EGFP is also sparsely expressed in photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Furthermore, EGFP-positive RGC axons are detected in the superior colliculus (data not shown) and dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei (dLGN; <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Thus, the time course of retinogeniculate pathway remodeling can be followed (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>; <a href="#bib2">Godement et al., 1984</a>; <a href="#bib4">Penn et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#bib6">Yasuda et al., 2021</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p><i>In utero</i> intraocular AAV injection is an effective method of manipulating gene expression in the retina. In this protocol, the AAV used (AAV-DJ) expresses the gene-of-interest under the CAG promoter. This resulted in a high level of gene expression in the cells in the GCL (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>D). Cells in the INL and ONL are sparsely infected as well (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>D). This expression pattern may be due to the AAV-DJ serotype used. AAVs of different serotypes are known to have different tropisms for different retinal cell types in the neonatal retina (<a href="#bib5">Watanabe et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, an appropriate AAV serotype should be used in each experiment. Additional cell-type specific gene expression can be achieved using cell-type specific promoters or Cre-dependent viruses in combination with cell-type specific Cre-lines. Loss-of-function of specific genes can be done via the introduction of AAV-Cre into floxed animals. While this method facilitates broad manipulations of gene expression in the developing retina, there are a few limitations that should be considered.</p>
<p><b>Limitation 1:</b> Number of embryos injected. The number of embryos that can be injected is limited by the length of surgery, the position of the embryo within the uterus, and the thickness of the uterine wall. Surgeries must be completed within 30 min (from the time of incision) to ensure high survival rates of the pregnant female and embryos. The number of embryos injected during this time can be further limited if the embryos are not ideally positioned within the uterus or if the uterine wall is too thick (the thickness of the uterine wall may vary between pregnant females) for clear identification of and injection into the eye. Handling and manipulation of the embryos should be minimized to improve survival. Nevertheless, with practice, &gt; 80% of embryos (at least 10 embryos per pregnant CD1 mouse) can be injected.</p>
<p><b>Limitation 2:</b> Viral transduction efficiency and consistency. Using this protocol, high and uniform gene expression in the retina can be obtained in &gt; 90% of successfully injected (uniform fast green labeling of the eye) embryos. However, unsuccessfully injected embryos cannot be removed during surgery and will have to be identified after the pups are born. Therefore, we co-inject an AAV encoding a fluorescent protein to identify and exclude unsuccessfully injected animals. In all cases, evaluation of the efficiency and consistency of viral infections (e.g., via fluorescent protein expression or immunostaining) should be done for a proper interpretation of the data obtained.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Miscarriage of the pregnant female or low survival rates of the pregnant female and embryos post-surgery (related to steps 10–22).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Complete the surgery (beginning from the time of incision) within 30 min. Do not damage any blood vessels or the placenta. During the surgery, handle the embryos only by holding the uterine wall. Do not touch the placenta. Use ring forceps and not fine forceps or other sharp surgical tools to handle embryos.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Embryos are not ideally positioned within the uterine wall for intraocular injections (related to steps 14 and 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Gently turn the embryo within the uterus by pushing the embryo’s back using ring forceps until the eye is facing up. Be careful to not damage or touch the placenta during this process. If positioning an embryo is too difficult, it is better to move on to the next embryo so that the procedure can be completed within 30 min from the time of incision.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Uneven or low viral transduction in the retina (related to step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To verify successful AAV injections, add 0.1% fast green dye to the viral solution. In mice with non-pigmented eyes (e.g., CD1), an even and successful injection of virus is indicated by the fast green dye staying inside and evenly filling the eye (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>D and <a href="#fig4">4</a>A). If the dye appears diffuse or faint, the injection was unsuccessful and would result in uneven or low viral transduction. In mice with pigmented eyes (e.g., C57BL/6), this dye will not be visible and therefore cannot be used to indicate successful injections. In this case, fluorescent dyes can be used to monitor the successful injection of the virus solution into the embryonic eye (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>F). Additionally, pigmented embryonic eyes are easier to identify during surgery, facilitating more successful viral injections.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Viral transduction is detected in cells in the brain/outside the retina (related to steps 18 and 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Cells outside the retina may be infected due to a leak if the micropipette is injected too deep or if the injection speed is too high. Ensure that the micropipette is inserted just into the eye, and reduce infusion speeds.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Injected pups have developmental abnormalities such as coloboma, microphthalmia, or the inability to open the eyelid (related to step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To prevent these abnormalities, inject a small volume of AAV solution at a slow speed. The injected volume should not exceed 0.5 μL. Infusion speeds should also be reduced, and the narrowest possible micropipette (tip size &lt; 50 μm) should be used.</p>
