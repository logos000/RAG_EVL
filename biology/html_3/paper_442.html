<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The examination of circulating pro-vascular progenitor cell frequency and function is integral in understanding aberrant blood vessel homeostasis in individuals with cardiometabolic disease. Here, we outline the characterization of progenitor cell subsets from peripheral blood using high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, an intracellular detoxification enzyme previously associated with pro-vascular progenitor cell status. Using this protocol, cells can be examined by flow cytometry for ALDH activity and lineage restricted cell surface markers simultaneously.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib15">Terenzi et al. (2019)</a> and <a href="#bib8">Hess et al. (2019</a>, <a href="#bib7">2020)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Aldefluor for the assessment of ALDH activity</h3>
<p>Aldefluor (fluorescent cell substrate of ALDH) is a means through which ALDH activity can be assessed using a single cell suspension from umbilical cord blood, bone marrow or from peripheral blood (<a href="#bib6">Hess et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bib14">Storms et al., 1999</a>). Aldefluor consists of an active ALDH-substrate, an amino acetaldehyde molecule covalently bound to a BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-5-proprionic acid) fluorochrome that is metabolized by ALDH to an aminoacetate anion. The anion is retained inside the cell due to its resultant negative charge. Therefore, the amount of fluorescent product that accrues in viable cells correlates directly to ALDH activity. Importantly, progenitor cells of several lineages consistently demonstrate high levels of ALDH activity (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. High aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) Expression simulates progenitor cell differentiation). As cells differentiate toward maturity, ALDH activity is decreased. In order to quantify the level of ALDH activity within each viable cells, we compare the amount of the fluorescence product generated to cells treated with N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB), a reversible inhibitor of ALDH activity. The final essential component of the Aldefluor kit is the ALDH buffer which impedes the transport of metabolized Aldefluor reagent out of target cells during cell sorting and analysis procedures.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.2">Purpose of ALDH activity</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the characterization of hematopoietic progenitor cells has been achieved using cell surface markers such as CD34 and CD133 (<a href="#bib4">Fadini et al., 2006</a>, <a href="#bib3">2005</a>). Although surface markers can be used to loosely categorize progenitor cells of hematopoietic and endothelial lineages, these markers do not confer true progenitor cell status, and can fluctuate depending on cell cycle status and inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, there continues to be discrepancies in the literature concerning the most effective surface markers in predicting progenitor cell phenotype (<a href="#bib11">Peichev et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib10">Isner and Asahara, 1999</a>; <a href="#bib9">Hur et al., 2004</a>). In contrast to cell surface markers where the marker does not confer a specific progenitor cell function, ALDH is an intracellular enzyme that protects immature cells from oxidative stress and alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide (<a href="#bib6">Hess et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bib14">Storms et al., 1999</a>). Thus, long lived progenitor cells with high ALDH activity are resistant to oxidative damage. ALDH also represents also the rate limiting enzyme in the production of retinoic acid, a potent morphogen that drives progenitor cell expansion and differentiation in multiple lineages (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). As primitive progenitor cells mature and egress from the bone marrow, the expression of ALDH, is expected to diminish such that few circulating cells will possess high ALDH activity (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). However, using highly sensitive FACS technology, we can characterize and isolate cells with high ALDH activity that correlates consistently with progenitor status and function (<a href="#bib5">Hess et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#bib13">Putman et al., 2012</a>).</p>
<p>Our lab has demonstrated the utility of detecting cells with elevated ALDH activity in hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells with pro-vascular secretory function and functional vessel forming capacity <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> (<a href="#bib12">Putman et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib1">Capoccia et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib5">Hess et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#bib13">Putman et al., 2012</a>). Cells from BM or umbilical cord blood (UCB) with elevated ALDH activity demonstrated increased rates of multipotent hematopoietic colony formation when compared to cells with low ALDH activity. Furthermore, endothelial cells with high ALDH activity demonstrated enhanced tubule forming capacity in Matrigel. In animal models of surgically induced critical limb ischemia, injection of cells with elevated ALDH activity increased limb perfusion and limb use compared to cells with low ALDH activity via the stimulation of collateral small vessel formation. Proteomic analyses have revealed that cells with elevated ALDH activity possess a pro-vascular secretory profile and accelerate recovery of perfusion via neo-vessel formation induced by paracrine effects (<a href="#bib1">Capoccia et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib2">Cooper et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib13">Putman et al., 2012</a>, <a href="#bib12">2017</a>). Finally, we have examined ALDH activity in the characterization of pro-vascular progenitor cells in humans with T2D, undergoing bariatric surgery and receiving sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (<a href="#bib15">Terenzi et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib8">Hess et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib7">2020</a>). Notably, ALDH activity assessment in cells from peripheral blood was established as an important biomarker to discern pro-vascular progenitor cells in the peripheral vasculature and ALDH assessment can be used as an important tool to detect progenitor cells that support blood vessel homeostasis.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.3">General guidelines and preparations</h3>
<ol>
<li>20 – 30 mL of whole blood should be drawn by venipuncture and collected in 10 mL BD lavender tubes. These tubes are coated in EDTA and limit coagulation of peripheral blood. Following collection, tubes should be inverted several times. Blood samples should be processed within 24 h of collection.</li>
<li>Warm Ficoll Paque to room temperature (20°C) (10–15 min) before use.</li>
<li>Place SepMate collection tubes (15 mL) in the biological safety cabinet (BSC) based on how much blood you intend to process (1 SepMate/5 mL of blood collected).</li>
<li>Ensure pipette aid is sterilized and placed in BSC along with 10 mL serological pipettes to layer up to 10 mL of whole blood mixture onto Ficoll Paque.</li>
<li>Ensure full biocontainment and sterile procedures are followed.</li>

<li>Unstained control – will be used to establish forward and side scatter which examine cell size and granularity respectively. This allows for the effective characterization of cell morphology during analysis. Furthermore, from this panel we will gate on only cellular events, removing any excess debris or red blood cell contamination (these events have very low forward and side scatter values). We suggest recording 50,000 events to allow for precise gating of cellular events.</li>
<li>Compensation tubes – each tube will be specific for the fluorochromes that will be utilized. These tubes are used to optimize the compensation and to correct for any spectral overlap between fluorophores. We suggest recording 20,000 events per compensation tube to allow for accurate compensation.</li>
<li>DEAB control – will be used to create a positive and negative region for ALDH activity. This is especially important as we can confirm the immature phenotype of primitive progenitor cells. The gate should be set at &lt; 0.5% and we suggest recording 50,000 events to allow for precise gating of DEAB inhibition.</li>
<li>ALDH activity – will be used to assess ALDH activity in PBMNCs. There should be clear separation of granulocyte precursor and mature cells as depicted in <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>. Furthermore, what we term ALDH<sup>hi</sup>SSC<sup>low</sup> cells should have the greatest ALDH activity as they are the most primitive cell type, as such, they will have a greater forward scatter value than all other cell types. We suggest recording 50,000 events to allow for precise gating of ALDH activity and subsequent cell populations. (see <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting 5</a>)</li>
<li>Fluorescence minus one (FMO) tubes – will be used to establish gates for each fluorochrome in your panel. Each tube will contain all fluorochromes of interest but one. For example, the FMO for PE in our panel would contain FITC, PerCP-Cy5.5, PE-Cy7, APC, and BV421. We suggest recording 50,000 events for each FMO tube to allow for precise gating of each fluorophore.</li>
<li>Full panel analyses – is comprised of all surface marker antibodies in the specific panel you are testing. Since most analyses will come from these tubes, we suggest recording upwards of 1 million events to allow for appropriate examination of rare cellular events.</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Through the combined use of the gating strategies specified, elevated ALDH activity, and lineage specific surface markers, we have established a high throughput assay that affectively characterizes granulocyte precursor, monocyte precursor, and pro-angiogenic progenitor cell prevalence in patient versus control populations.</p>
<p>Variability when analyzing human PB samples is to be expected. For example, individuals with increased risk of glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity and risk of ischemic cardiovascular complications are expected to have a reduced prevalence of pro-vascular progenitor cells with elevated ALDH activity (<a href="#bib15">Terenzi et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib8">Hess et al., 2019</a>). Moreover, in disease states, such as T2D, that confer elevated and/or chronic inflammation, we expect a decreased prevalence of monocyte precursor cells with elevated ALDH activity and an increased prevalence of pro-inflammatory granulocyte precursor cells with elevated ALDH activity compared to healthy controls.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have demonstrated that true hematopoietic progenitor cells (ALDH<sup>hi</sup>SSC<sup>low</sup> CD34+/CD133+) are extremely rare (&lt;0.05% of cellular events) in the peripheral blood. However, when using umbilical cord blood, you can expect the prevalence of progenitor cells with elevated ALDH activity to be considerably elevated (approximately 1% of cellular events).</p>
<p>Please refer to (<a href="#bib15">Terenzi et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib8">Hess et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib7">2020</a>) for data related to human peripheral blood</p>

<ol>
<li>We first gate on all cellular events, this is done to remove any remaining cellular debris that was detected (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A). Axes should be labeled as FSC and SSC on the X and Y axes respectively.
<ol type="a">
<li>Apply this gate to all plots to maintain a consistent gate shape for all tubes of interest.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use <i>“ALDH-inhibited”</i> DEAB plots to establish a positive and negative gate for ALDH activity (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B)
<ol type="a">
<li>Label cells to the right of the DEAB gate as “ALDH<sup>hi</sup>” cells and cells to the left of the DEAB gate as “ALDH<sup>lo</sup>” cells.</li>
<li>This allows the user to clearly decipher immature precursor “ALDH<sup>hi</sup>” cells from mature and differentiated “ALDH<sup>lo</sup>” cells.</li>
<li>Apply this gate to all plots to maintain a consistent gate shape for all tubes of interest.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use side scatter (a marker of cellular granularity) to characterize granulocyte precursor cells, monocyte precursor cells and primitive progenitor cells (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>C).
<ol type="a">
<li>We label each cell subcategory based on ALDH activity and cellular complexity</li>
<li>Granulocyte precursor cells correspond to ALDH<sup>hi</sup>SSC<sup>hi</sup> cells</li>
<li>Monocyte precursor cells correspond to ALDH<sup>hi</sup>SSC<sup>mid</sup> cells</li>
<li>Primitive progenitor cells (including hematopoietic and endothelial cells) correspond to ALDH<sup>hi</sup>SSC<sup>low</sup> cells</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Within each group, fluorescence minus one (FMO) gates are used to examine specific surface marker expression within that cell population (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>D).
<ol type="a">
<li>Axes should reflect the FSC and the fluorochrome of interest respectively. For example, FMO-PE axes should be FSC and PE for the Y and X axes.</li>
<li>Apply this gate to all plots to maintain a consistent gate shape for all tubes of interest.</li>
<li>Tip: you may choose to calculate the FMO of each fluorophore in a specific ALDH subcategory, on all cellular events, on all ALDH<sup>hi</sup>, or all ALDH<sup>lo</sup> cells depending on your specified analyses.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Following completion of gates for each fluorochrome, we can move to examining the full panels for analyses.
<ol type="a">
<li>First measure the frequency of cellular events using the gate from step 1.</li>
<li>Measure the frequency of each fluorochrome on all cellular events, this will demonstrate the power of including elevated ALDH activity in your examination of progenitor cells.</li>
<li>Next measure the frequency of each ALDH<sup>hi</sup> subcategory if applicable to a specific cell type you are examining.</li>
<li>Depending on your intended analyses, measure the co-expression of multiple surface markers within each ALDH<sup>hi</sup> subcategory. For example, we frequently use the co-expression of CD34+/CD133+ cells within the ALDH<sup>hi</sup>SSC<sup>lo</sup><sup>w</sup> subcategory to characterize pro-vascular progenitor cells.</li>
<li>Get creative with your analyses, look for different connections within each cell panel.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>When conducting the protocol without SepMate tubes, it is critical not only to effectively layer the blood sample onto the Ficoll, but also to remove the buffy coat with precision. The use of SepMate tubes removes this limitation.</p>
<p>In addition, check published literature to examine the effectiveness of surface markers specific to your intended analyses. Some antibodies may bind more effectively to your cell of interest and therefore more applicable to your research. Additionally, more rare cells should be placed on brighter fluorophores to aid the examination of these cells in analyses.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>There seems to be incomplete separation of whole blood into plasma, buffy coat, and red blood cell layers.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<ol>
<li>Ensure the whole blood is fresh (collected &lt;24 h prior to beginning the experiment), if blood is not fresh, it may become coagulated and will not produce accurate results.</li>
<li>Reduce ejection speed of pipette aid and tilt SepMate tube (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A). This will help to slowly layer the whole blood onto the Ficoll.</li>
<li>Ensure the centrifuge is set to the appropriate configurations and balanced properly. If the centrifuge is not calibrated properly, separation will not be complete.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>There is still a red ring surrounding my pellet following ammonium chloride addition (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add 9 mL of ammonium chloride and 1 mL of PBS+5% FBS to the sample tube and allow the solution to sit for 8 min. Next centrifuge the sample and repeat these steps until the pellet is opaque (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>E).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>I am unable to run the sample within the 24 h time limit and want to fix the cells in order to analyze them in the future, is this applicable?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<ol>
<li>While applicable to use fixed cells for the examination of cell surface markers by flow cytometry at a later date, the examination of ALDH expression requires live cells. Therefore, if researchers decide to fix the cells, they will not be able to examine ALDH expression in the sample.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>DEAB does not seem to inhibit Aldefluor signal appropriately.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<ol>
<li>During the next experiment, ensure that the “ALDH-inhibited” tube is capped immediately following DEAB reagent addition. It is possible that the substrate is evaporating and is therefore unable to inhibit ALDH activity properly.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Aldefluor signal is dim or there is no clear separation of ALDH<sup>hi</sup> cells</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<ol>
<li>Consult Aldefluor kit brochure to confirm Aldefluor activation was completed properly. Furthermore, ensure proper mixing and incubation time prior to analyses. Activated Aldefluor should appear neon green immediately if it has been activated properly. Solution may appear cloudy, but this will not affect the potency of the Aldefluor.
