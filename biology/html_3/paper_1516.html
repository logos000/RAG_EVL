<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Mitochondria-lysosome contact sites are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial and lysosomal network dynamics and mediating metabolite exchange. Here, we present a protocol to quantitatively analyze the formation and tethering duration of mitochondria-lysosome contact sites by using time-lapse live confocal microscopy of LAMP1 and TOMM20. Although this protocol focuses on mammalian HeLa cells, it can be applied to other cell types for further studies on mitochondria-lysosome contact regulation and function, and elucidation of their role in human disorders.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(22)00142-3/sref7">Wong et al.

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Cellular homeostasis depends on the proper regulation of both mitochondria and lysosomal function and dynamics over time. Mitochondria-lysosome contact sites were recently identified as a dynamic pathway for maintaining organelle homeostasis in multiple cell types, and are implicated in various human diseases (<a href="#bib3">Kim et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib4">Peng et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib7">Wong et al., 2018</a>, <a href="#bib6">2019b</a>). These contacts serve as a pathway for crosstalk between both organelles through the bidirectional regulation of mitochondrial and lysosomal network dynamics, and metabolite transfer such as the exchange of calcium, iron, cholesterol, and other lipids (<a href="#bib5">Wong et al., 2019a</a>). As a result of the crucial role these sites play in organelle dynamics and maintaining normal metabolite composition within the cell, many human diseases have recently been linked to dysfunction in the formation and regulation of mitochondria-lysosome contacts (<a href="#bib8">Cisneros et al., 2022</a>). Consequently, investigating mitochondria-lysosome contact site dynamics may provide important insights into cellular function as well as defects occurring in disease.</p>
<p>In this protocol, we establish a method for visualizing and analyzing mitochondria-lysosome contact sites within HeLa cells in real time. Importantly, high spatial and temporal resolution live confocal imaging of the lysosomal membrane and the outer mitochondrial membrane permits the analysis of mitochondria-lysosome contact sites in living cells, and allows for further investigation into how they influence cellular homeostasis. Here, we describe the culturing of HeLa cells to provide viable cells for transfection and live imaging, and subsequent live cell confocal microscopy and analysis of mitochondria-lysosome contact formation and tethering dynamics. Together, this protocol provides a reliable, quantitative method for analyzing mitochondria-lysosome contact site dynamics in living cells.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Prior to imaging, HeLa media in live cell plate appears clear without an excess of floating cells. At time of imaging, cell confluency is expected to be 80%–100%, with normal morphology (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>A–1C). During confocal imaging, cells have normal morphology and demonstrate bright fluorescently labeled mitochondria and lysosomes which are clearly distinguishable from any autofluorescence, background fluorescence, or noise (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D). This indicates appropriate transfection efficiency and fluorophore localization. However, some cells may have an abnormally high amount of autofluorescence with indistinguishable organelle structures. These cells are likely dead, containing static mitochondria and lysosomes, and should not be included in the analysis (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D). Mitochondria and lysosomes within healthy properly transfected cells are highly mobile and visibly form mitochondria-lysosome contact sites that remain stably tethered over time (∼60 s on average) before untethering from each other, over the course of the movie. Time-lapse acquisitions should be free of significant photobleaching for at least 3 min to ensure appropriate subsequent analysis of contact sites.</p>

In the example, 3 lysosomes are in contact with mitochondria (yellow arrows) out of 10 lysosomes in the region of interest, resulting in a final quantification of 30% lysosomes tethered in mitochondria-lysosome contacts.</p>
<p>(B) Example analysis of mitochondria-lysosome contact tethering duration, measured as the minimum duration of mitochondria and lysosomes in contact with one another before untethering. Mitochondria and lysosome should appear directly beside each other throughout the duration of contact tethering. Once the two organelles separate from each other (distance between organelles is &gt;0.1 μm), the mitochondria and lysosome are no longer considered to be in contact. In the example, the mitochondria-lysosome contact remains tethered for a 40 s duration.</p>

<li>Define a region of interest in the cell which contains at least 10 lysosomes. If possible, the entire cell can be analyzed rather than a specific region of interest.</li>
<li>Count the total number of lysosomes in that region at frame 1 (t=0 s).</li>
<li>Identify which lysosomes are dynamically tethered to mitochondria (within 0.1 μm of one another throughout the duration of contact) in a mitochondria-lysosome contact at frame 1 (t=0 s) and which remain tethered together for &gt;10 s.

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Users should be blind to experimental conditions during image analysis when possible, in order to minimize bias and subjectivity during analysis of mitochondria-lysosome contact formation and tethering dynamics. Additional super-resolution microscopy imaging techniques may further help to identify and validate the formation and tethering of membrane contact sites between mitochondria and lysosomes (see <a href="#sec7.13">troubleshooting 7</a>).</div>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Lysosomes are highly mobile in healthy cells and can cross paths with other lysosomes during the movie. This may make it difficult to clearly track the movement and location of one lysosome and its contact tethering dynamics throughout the movie. If the lysosome being analyzed significantly overlaps with other cellular components, it is recommended to exclude it from the analysis and to track another lysosome instead. It is also advisable to take note of the average lysosome size within the cell type used to aid in distinguishing between one or multiple lysosomes. For the cell type used in this experiment, lysosomes had an average diameter of 0.3–0.6 μm. Any lysosomes which were grouped together in clusters significantly larger than this diameter were not considered as a single lysosome. In addition, while the cells used in this protocol are HeLa cells, other cell types can be used for analysis with alternative plasmids and conditions of interests, depending on the research question. Experimental results may also depend on cell health and size. Thus, it may be challenging to find contact sites or obtain a representative measure of their contact percentage and duration if cells are unhealthy or at low confluency at the time of imaging.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Difficulty in finding cells during live cell imaging.</p>
<p>When cells are not grown at a high confluency or appear unhealthy, it can be difficult to find healthy cells for confocal microscopy imaging (see Protocol step 20).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Prior to confocal imaging, it is important to ensure that the live cell plates are at an appropriate confluency. If cells remain at a low confluency even after passaging, it is possible that a new cell batch may be required in order to address this issue.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Live cell plates with high degree of floating cells.</p>
<p>High rates of cell death in live cell plates can result in a large amount of floating dead cells within the live cell plate. It is important that this is avoided because it will significantly decrease the ability to find large, unobstructed, healthy cells. Large numbers of dead cells may also increase fluorescent background (see Protocol steps 20 and 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Incomplete resuspension, vigorous handling, or contamination may all result in decreased cell viability. For this reason, gentle and sterile handling of cells is essential during cell culture, as well as thorough resuspension and distribution. If these problems persist after re-passaging, it may be helpful to thaw a new batch of cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Dim or absent fluorescent signal.</p>
<p>If the transfection efficiency is not sufficient or too little time has passed since transfection, it is possible that the fluorescent signal may appear dim or be completely absent (see Protocol step 20).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is important to allow at least 24 h (but not more than 36) to pass between transfection and imaging to ensure high levels of fluorophore expression. It is also critical to occasionally check the concentration of the plasmids used during transfection to ensure that an adequate amount of DNA is being used for transfection.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Fluorescence bleaching during live cell imaging.</p>
<p>Depending on the fluorophores used and the desired duration of imaging, photobleaching may occur with increasing light dose (see Protocol steps 24 and 27).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To limit light exposure on your sample, adjust the laser power to the minimum point at which a clear signal can still be observed. Generally this occupies half of the available gray levels in an image. It may also be helpful to work quickly and diligently while locating cells for acquisition in order to avoid unnecessary bleaching. It is also helpful to use the channel with the slowest bleaching fluorophore when searching for cells to decrease photobleaching prior to time-lapse acquisitions.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>High background fluorescence.</p>
<p>High levels of background fluorescence may be a result of low fluorescent protein expression (resulting in a low signal to noise ratio) or high cell density while imaging (see Protocol step 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First confirm the appropriate expression levels of the chosen fluorescent proteins. If the expression is consistent with successful image acquisition, check the cell confluence with a low magnification objective. If cell confluency is &gt;95%, consider repeating this protocol plating at an initial lower cell density. Additionally, imaging in Fluorobrite™ DMEM may also help limit background fluorescence for sparse fluorophores.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>High levels of fluorophore clustering.</p>
<p>Many fluorescent proteins may form oligomers when expression levels are too high. Regions of highly clustered and unusually bright signal may represent oligomerization which may affect downstream analysis (see Protocol step 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Perform a new imaging experiment with conditions that include different plasmid dilutions during transfection. Alternatively, it is also possible to examine expression levels of the chosen fluorescent proteins by immunoblot analysis to determine if levels are significantly higher (ex. more than two times) than the endogenous levels of that protein. If expression is too high, repeat the protocol with a lower amount of plasmid DNA. If the expression is appropriate but clustering is still observed, repeat the protocol with alternative fluorescent fusion proteins which are monomeric and do not form dimers or oligomers.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Validation of membrane contact sites during analysis of live cell movies.</p>
<p>The ability to identify mitochondria and lysosomes tethered at a membrane contact site may be difficult using standard 100× objectives on conventional confocal systems (see <a href="#quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>As conventional confocal imaging resolution is physically limited by the diffraction barrier to ∼200 nm, while membrane contacts often span junctions of ∼10–30 nm, identifying contact sites may be difficult in certain scenarios. In addition, sub-optimal imaging conditions may further convolute images, resulting in resolutions closer to 300 nm. Thus, utilization of super-resolution imaging methods such as structured illumination microscopy (SIM) or Airyscan which achieve resolutions as small as 80–120 nm and 120–180 nm respectively may be helpful. Importantly, super-resolution microscopy may help to dramatically enhance image quality, making determination and tracking of organelle contacts easier and more accurate (<a href="#bib7">Wong et al., 2018</a>). Alternatively, software-based approaches to super resolution such as point-scanning super resolution (PSSR) (<a href="#bib2">Fang et al., 2021</a>) may also help to enhance image resolution when access to super resolution systems are limited.</p>
