<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Mitochondria play pivotal roles in cellular energy metabolism. Most of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is generated by mitochondrial respiration. The Cell Mito Stress Test is a common method to measure the key parameters of mitochondrial respiration. Here, we use the human cell line HK-2 as an example to present the procedures to quantify the oxygen consumption rate using a Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib9">Ma et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<li>For running the assay, the cell culture medium should be replaced with assay medium. Therefore, make sure that there are sufficient and fresh reagents before you begin, especially the 100 mM Pyruvate Solution and 200 mM Glutamine Solution, which are needed to be added to the XF base medium for assay medium preparation.</li>
<li>Observe the morphology or growth changes of your cells under an inverted microscope. HK-2 cells are anchorage dependent. They should not be allowed to become confluent, therefore, make sure that the cells are in a monolayer configuration and at 80% of confluence.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The assay medium should be prepared and used only on the assay day. If other media are used, it must not contain sodium bicarbonate because otherwise it will buffer the media and pH measurements will not be accurate.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> HK-2 cells are cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, but any other appropriate growth medium can be used as well.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The HK-2 cell line should not be passaged for more than 50 times.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> All the reagents and equipment that contact with cells must be sterile. A strict aseptic technique should be performed for all the procedures.</div>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The Cell Mito Stress Test Kit contains oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and rotenone/antimycin A. The injection of oligomycin, which, by inhibiting ATP synthase, could rapidly hyperpolarize the mitochondrial membrane, thereby preventing protons passing through the complexes. FCCP, as an uncoupling agent of oxidative phosphorylation, could reverse the hyperpolarized state caused by oligomycin through carrying the protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Finally, the injection of R/A could inhibit mitochondrial complexes I and III completely stopping the mitochondrial respiration. They are useful in step 8 of Day of the assay: day 4.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Though different cell types exhibit different metabolic characteristics, a desirable Seahorse Cell Mito Stress Test will show a few same hallmarks. The result shows the Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) data in rate mode (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). It begins with measuring the base level of OCR, as the complex III inhibitor oligomycin injects, the OCR is rapidly decreased. This will be reversed by the injection of FCCP, an uncoupling agent that can dissipate the proton gradient and maximize the OCR. Finally, followed by the injection of Rotenone/antimycin A, the OCR decreases again. Parameters calculated in the form of bar chart include ATP-linked respiration, proton leak, basal respiration, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Basal respiration (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) shows the energetic demand of cells under basal conditions, the oxygen consumption of basal respiration used to meet ATP synthesis and result in mitochondrial proton leak. ATP-linked respiration (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) is reflected by the decrease in OCR following the injection of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, which is the portion of basal respiration. The remaining basal respiration not coupled to ATP synthesis after oligomycin injection represents the proton leak (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>), which can be a sign of mitochondrial damage. Maximal respiration (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) represents the maximum capacity that the electron respiratory chain can achieve. The maximal oxygen consumption rate is measured by injection of the uncoupler FCCP. Spare respiration (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) is the difference between maximal and basal respiration, which reflects the capability of the cells to respond to changes in energetic demand and indicates the fitness of the cells. Non-mitochondrial respiration is the oxygen consumption due to cellular enzymes other than mitochondria after injection of rotenone and antimycin A.</p>
<p>Here, we show an example of cells treated with SQSTM1/p62 overexpression plasmids which induces changes of mitochondrial respiration (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A is the rate data, which is the primary output of the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer showing a quantitative measurement of oxygen consumption of cellular respiration over time. The bar chart in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B is a way to present the key parameters of mitochondrial function by analyzing and calculating as described in a previous paragraph. Compared with transfected with control plasmids pcDNA 3.1(+), transfected with SQSTM1/p62 overexpression plasmids results in the increases of basal and maximal respiratory capacity, spare respiratory capacity, and ATP-linked OCR, which suggests SQSTM1/p62 could affect mitochondrial respiration.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The Cell Mito Stress Test is a common assay to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of live cells for the evaluation of mitochondrial respiration function by using Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer. Though the measurement requires only a small number of cells (<a href="#bib3">Gonzalez-Ortiz et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib10">van der Windt et al., 2016</a>), it still has limitations. First, compared to the Clark-Type Oxygen Electrode, the Cell Mito Stress Test cannot measure the OCR of tissues (<a href="#bib2">Divakaruni et al., 2014</a>), but it can measure respiration in isolated mitochondria from tissues (<a href="#bib6">Long et al., 2016</a>). In addition, this protocol is strict with cell operations. Accurate cell counting is important for lowering variability between groups. Optimal cell density to ensure cells are uniformly and evenly seeded in a monolayer configuration (<a href="#bib5">Lange et al., 2012</a>). If there are cells clusters, it may cause poor cell adhesion and inaccurate measurement of OCR (<a href="#bib8">Luz et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p>The Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer can automatically inject the drugs through air pressure (<a href="#bib11">Wettmarshausen and Perocchi, 2019</a>), however, the main restriction is that mitochondria cannot directly accessible to the full dose of drugs in intact cells, which might be impermeable to the mitochondrial complex inhibitors. Therefore, it needs to be taken into account the permeability of cell membrane and the complexity of cytoplasmic metabolism when assessing the mitochondrial respiration in intact cells. Nevertheless, compared with the organism, the intact cells still lack in vivo context. This technique needs to add some substrate like medium, pyruvate, glutamine, and glucose, which may affect the outcome of the measurement (<a href="#bib1">Brand and Nicholls, 2011</a>; <a href="#bib4">Hill et al., 2012</a>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Poor basal signal (step 10)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Poor basal signal could be caused by insufficient cell number and you can increase the number of cells (step 3). Another reason for poor basal signal may be incubate the cell microplate in a non-CO<sub>2</sub>, 37°C incubator too long (step 7d). This will decrease the viability of cells. Make sure the time for incubating the cell plate in a non-CO<sub>2</sub>, 37°C incubator is at least 30 min but no more than 1 h.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Minimal or unexpected changes in OCR after compounds injection (step 10)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When the changes in OCR is minimal in a certain well, it may be because there is no drug injected to the port of the sensory cartridge, to make sure all the ports are filled with drugs after injection (after step 8). If the changes in OCR are minimal in most wells, this may be caused by the low concentration of the drugs or the poor condition of cells. View the cells under microscope before run the assay to make sure that the cells are healthy, uniform, and in a monolayer configuration. Titration of drugs’ concentration when the cells are healthy.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>High variability between replicates (steps 3 and 4)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The major cause of variation might be uneven cell numbers or the sensors does not work properly.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to make sure the same volume of cells is seeded in each well of the replicates. Meanwhile, make sure all the sensors are submerged in the XF Calibrant and hydrated in the non-CO<sub>2</sub>, 37°C incubator for 12–18 h. Make sure to use sensory cartridges and cell microplate before the expiration date.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Variability between wells (step 3)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Cells need to culture in incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C for 12–18 h prior to an XF assay. Because of interventions introduced to the cells, including genetic modifications and compound treatments, the cell number might be changed during the culture. This need to be taken into account before seeding cells. One method is to test the doubling time of cells, thus choosing the optimal number of cells in different groups. Another method is to use the CyQuant cell proliferation assay (<a href="#bib11">Wettmarshausen and Perocchi, 2019</a>).</p>
