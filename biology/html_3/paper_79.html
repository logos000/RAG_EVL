<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol describes a robust method for the generation of engineered human myocardium (EHM) from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in a multi-well plate under defined, serum-free conditions. By parallel culture of up to 48 EHM in one plate, contractile heart muscle can be obtained to serve numerous applications, including drug screening and disease modelling. This protocol has been successfully applied to human embryonic stem (HES) cell- and induced PSC-derived cardiomyocytes, subtype-specific, i.e., atrial and ventricular, and commercially available cardiomyocyte preparations.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib8">Tiburcy et al. (2017)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before You Begin</h2>
<p>The generation of engineered human myocardium (EHM) requires human PSC-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts and follows these major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cardiomyocyte preparation: We typically use cardiomyocytes from human PSCs 18 to 25 days after the start of directed differentiation. Cardiomyocytes should have a high purity (&gt;90%). Cardiomyocytes from different monolayer and embryoid body protocols have been successfully used for EHM generation (<a href="#bib1">Borchert et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib3">Cyganek et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib4">Kattman et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib5">Riegler et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib8">Tiburcy et al., 2017</a>). In addition, cryo-preserved cardiomyocytes, for example from commercial vendors, may be applied. For optimal standardization of the EHM protocol we recommend to re-plate either fresh or frozen cardiomyocytes as monolayer culture prior to their defined application (steps 1–4). If cardiomyocytes are derived in monolayer differentiation you may directly proceed to step 5.</li>
<li>Fibroblast preparation (steps 14–18): We typically use human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) for practical reasons (availability from for example ATCC as readily expandable cultures, see <a href="#krt">Key Resources Table</a>) and standardization.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Primary cardiac fibroblasts (see <a href="#krt">Key Resources Table</a>) or PSC-derived fibroblasts will similarly work and may be advantageous under certain experimental conditions, e.g., disease modeling.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Cell mix and hydrogel preparation (steps 28–35): For optimal results, EHM are constructed from 0.5 million cell mixtures (consisting of 70% cardiomyocytes and 30% fibroblasts) in a final reconstitution volume of 180 μl. The use of commercially available 48-well plates permits casting and culture in a one-step procedure with a defined circular geometry and exposure to mechanical loading for video-optic monitoring of EHM formation and function.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> All procedures are performed in Class II biosafety hoods located within laboratories rated at biosafety level 1 or 2 (depending on the virus status of PSC lines and local regulations). Approval for work with PSCs and their derivatives must be obtained and performed in accordance with respective legal and ethical regulations. All cultures are maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</div>

<p>EHM culture is typically performed for 28 days, but can be further extended. We have tested EHM cultures in a multi-well format for up to 12 months without an apparent loss of function. Functional assessment of EHM can be performed by video-optic analyses or in a standard organ bath set-up under isometric conditions after removal of EHM from the multi-well plate (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) at any day during culture.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected Outcomes</h2>
<p>After successful formation of EHM first contractions are typically observed after 3 days. Force generation, as detected by rhythmic pole deflection, will increase notably within the first 2 weeks to reach robust levels by week 4. Nevertheless, the magnitude of pole deflection may further increase and cultures can be maintained for up to 1 year (longest time tested). Spontaneous contraction rate typically decreases with time in culture and can cease completely, requiring electrical stimulation for contractile studies. Apart from the functional analyses EHM can be easily removed from the plate by pulling the flexible holders out to continue with downstream analyses (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). For details on the use and in-depth characterization of the resulting EHM, please consult <a href="#bib8">Tiburcy et al., 2017</a> and <a href="#bib3">Cyganek et al., 2018</a>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Contractility measurements in the multi-well plate format require spontaneously beating EHM and are not performed under defined isometric conditions. Spontaneous beating rate decreases with time in culture. Thus, external electrical stimulation may be required for functional analyses in the multi-well format. Alternatively, remove EHM to perform assessments of contractile function under isometric conditions and electrical stimulation individually in standard organ bath set-ups (e.g., Radnoti 8 Unit Tissue Organ Bath System).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>EHM disrupted after initial culture medium addition, i.e., 1 h after casting.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>At this stage care must be taken to not physically disrupt the hydrogel. Do not pipette culture medium directly onto the condensing EHM. Add culture medium slowly via the well wall.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>EHM do not condense within 1 h after casting.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Hydrogel condensation is a material intrinsic, i.e., largely cell independent, property of the collagen type I hydrogel (refer for details to <a href="#bib6">Schlick et al. 2019</a>). Care must be taken to not disrupt condensation by quickly casting the pH neutralized reconstitution mixture. In addition, the collagen hydrogel should be tested as to its condensation properties before use in EHM generation. Testing different suppliers and batches may be required for optimal results. Acetic acid solubilized collagen with a collagen concentration of &gt;4 mg/mL gives best results. Care must be taken to store and handling of collagen at 4±2°C; collagen must never be frozen or handled at room temperature.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>EHM do not compact within 3 days after casting.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>The compaction process is a function of the fibroblast component. Ensure fibroblasts viability and sufficient quantity preferably 30% of input cells. Optimal fibroblast content may have to be adapted depending on the source of fibroblasts. A too high fibroblast content will result in massive EHM compaction with a steep increase in EHM stiffness (Young’s Modulus) and inhibit EHM contractility; a too low fibroblast content will result in a lack of EHM compaction with negligible or no contractile force development (refer to <a href="#bib8">Tiburcy et al., 2017</a> for details).</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>EHM do not contract visibly within 2 weeks after casting.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>EHM contractility is a function of the cardiomyocyte component. Ensure cardiomyocyte viability after enzymatic dispersion and purity at preferably 70% of input cells. Optimal cardiomyocyte content may have to be adapted depending on the source of cardiomyocytes. Too low or too high cardiomyocyte purity will result in suboptimal or no contractile performance (refer to <a href="#bib8">Tiburcy et al., 2017</a> for details).</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>EHM do not contract uniformly in the 48-well plate.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Casting procedure may have to be trained to ensure completion of the casting from the prepared reconstitution mixture within ideally 5 min. Note that the reconstitution mixture will start to condense after pH neutralization and that this process must not be inappropriately disrupted. However, ensure proper mixing of cells in the prepared reconstitution mixture by trituration (10x on ice) before casting. EHM may stop to contract spontaneously after extended culture, but will remain contractile upon external electrical stimulation.</p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>EHM do not form a homogeneous loop.</p>
<h3>Potential Solution</h3>
<p>Ensure continuous pipetting of a well-mixed EHM reconstitution mixture into the mold. Breaks or inhomogenous distribution of EHM reconstitution mixture must be avoided.</p>
