<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Targeted regulation of mitochondrial gene expression is challenging due to the lack of a mitochondria-specific delivery system. We have previously developed various stimuli-responsive nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery systems to transport nucleic acids for regulation of target gene expression. This protocol describes the design and preparation of an NP platform for mitochondria-specific gene delivery (mito-NP). We use mito-NP in primary liver fibroblasts that are transplanted into mice. Mito-NP can be used to deliver various nucleic acid therapeutics and to treat mitochondria-regulated diseases.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib16">Zhao et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Prior to the preparation of the mitochondria-specific targeting nanoplatform (denoted mito-NP), a triphenylphosphonium (TPP)-decorated amphiphilic cationic peptide (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>CONH-GR<sub>6</sub>GGGK(TPP)G-OH, denoted TACP) and an endosomal pH-responsive polymer, methoxyl-poly(ethylene glycol)-<i>b</i>-poly(2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (denoted Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA) were required. The design principle and chemical structure are provided as below.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Design of Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA</h3>
<p>The endosomal pH-responsive polymer, Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA, is an amphiphilic block copolymer with a hydrophilic PEG segment and a hydrophobic PDPA segment. In aqueous solution, this polymer could spontaneously self-assemble into stable nanoparticles (NPs) with PEG chain as hydrophilic outer shell and PDPA chain as hydrophobic inner core. The PEG outer shell could improve the stability of NPs and prolong their half-life by minimizing their non-specific interactions with serum components (<a href="#bib6">Knop et al., 2010</a>). The PDPA inner core could be used to encapsulate hydrophobic therapeutics (e.g., small molecule inhibitors, chemotherapeutic drugs) or the complexes of cationic lipid and nucleic acid. More importantly, because the Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA polymer shows a sharp pH-responsive characteristic with a p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> (∼6.35) close to the endosomal pH (6.0–6.5) (<a href="#bib8">Wang et al., 2014</a>), the PDPA segment could be protonated in the endosomal microenvironment to induce the endosomal swelling via the “proton sponge” effect (<a href="#bib9">Won et al., 2009</a>), thereby improving the endosomal escape ability of the encapsulated therapeutics. The chemical structure of Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA polymer is shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> and the detailed synthesis of this polymer has been reported in detail in our previous studies (<a href="#bib12">Xu et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib13">Xu et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sec1.2">Design of TACP</h3>
<p>The mitochondria-targeting peptide TACP is an amphiphilic peptide, which is composed of a hydrophobic alkyl chain, an oligoarginine-containing peptide sequence, and a TPP side group. The positively charged oligoarginine sequence could not only complex nucleic acid such as circRNA-expressing vector through electrostatic interaction, but also shows the ability to penetrate membrane including endosomal and mitochondrial membrane (<a href="#bib4">Fuchs and Raines, 2006</a>). The incorporation of TPP group into the TACP structure is mainly due to its unique mitochondria-targeting ability (<a href="#bib7">Smith et al., 2003</a>). When dissolving TACP in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and then mixing with the aqueous solution of circRNA-expressing vector, the complexes of TACP and vector could be formed with the hydrophobic alkyl chains positioned on the surface of the TACP/vector complexes, which could then be encapsulated into the hydrophobic cores of the NPs made with the Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA polymer (<a href="#bib11">Xu et al., 2018</a>). In this protocol, we specifically designed the mitochondria-targeting peptide TACP according to our previous studies (<a href="#bib1">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib10">Xu et al., 2012</a>) and this peptide was then synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd. The chemical structure of TACP is shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Take 50 mg of Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA polymer to 10 mL of glass vial and add 5 mL of DMF using a pipette (Metric, 100–1,000 μL).</li>
<li>Place the glass vial to a sonicator bath for 1–2 min sonication (50 W) to prepare homogenous polymer solution at a concentration of 10 mg/mL.</li>
<li>Similarly, take 10 mg of mitochondria-targeting peptide TACP and dissolve it in 2 mL of DMSO prepare homogenous peptide solution at a concentration of 5 mg/mL.</li>
<li>Take 200 μL of Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA solution (step 2) and 50 μL of TACP solution (step 3) using a pipette (Metric, 20–200 μL) to 1 mL of glass vial and add 10 μg of circRNA-expressing vector (1 mg/mL aqueous solution).</li>
<li>Take 5 mL of commercially available HyPure water (molecular biology grade) to 20 mL of sterilized glass vial containing a stirring bar (15 mm in length and 5 mm in diameter) inside a standard laboratory biosafety cabinet.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The pH value of the Hypure water should be a neutral pH that is higher than the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> (∼6.35) of the Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA polymer.

<ol start="6">
<li>Place the glass vial on a magnetic stirrer and use a pipette (Metric, 100–1,000 μL) to add the mixture (step 4) dropwise into the Hypure water under vigorously stirring at 400 × <i>g</i>.</li>
<li>Seal the glass vial and keep stirring on the magnetic stirrer at ∼20°C–25°C for ∼2–3 min followed by transferring the mito-NP suspension to an ultrafiltration device (15 mL, MWCO 100K).</li>
<li>Centrifuge at ∼800–1,800 × <i>g</i> for 10 min to remove the organic solvent and free compounds.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Although centrifugation at a low speed (&lt;800 × <i>g</i>) could also remove the organic solvent and free compounds from the mito-NP suspension, longer experimental time is required, in which part of encapsulated circRNA-expressing vector may release from the mito-NP. Higher centrifugation speed (&gt;1,800 × <i>g</i>) is not suggested because it usually induces the aggregation of the mito-NP. Our experience suggests that ∼800–1,800 × <i>g</i> is an appropriate speed for the purification of mito-NP.</div>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> In order to obtain more primary liver fibroblasts, the collected liver tissues should be dissected as tiny as possible before digestion. Occasionally, little amount of red blood cells (RBCs) may mix with the extracted primary liver fibroblasts, which can be removed via repeated change of the culture medium. If residual RBCs still exist, RBC lysis buffer is recommended. In addition, aseptic operation is recommended to avoid contamination and penicillin-streptomycin could be used during cell culture.</div>

<i>In vitro</i> evaluation of mitochondria-targeting ability of mito-NP</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼5 days</div>
<p>To evaluate the mitochondria-targeting ability, fluorescent dye (e.g., Cy5 and Cy7) labeled vector or fluorescence-expressing vector (e.g., pXCX-CMV-EGFP) (<a href="#bib5">Glover et al., 2002</a>) needs to be encapsulated into the mito-NP, which could facilitate to real-time track the vector distribution in the liver fibroblasts. Herein, GFP-expressing vector is used an example and encapsulated into the mito-NP, which can be used to evaluate the <i>in vitro</i> mitochondria-targeting ability and examine the transfection efficacy of the mito-NP.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>Remove the medium from the cell culture flask and wash the primary liver fibroblasts with 10 mL of PBS solution thrice inside a standard laboratory biosafety cabinet.</li>
<li>Add 3 mL of 0.25% trypsin to digest the cells for 3–5 min and then stop digestion using 10 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS.</li>
<li>Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL of centrifuge tube inside a standard laboratory biosafety cabinet and centrifuge the tube at 450 × <i>g</i> for 10 min.</li>
<li>Remove the medium and add 1 mL of cell culture medium to resuspend the cells using a pipette (Metric, 100–1,000 μL) inside a standard laboratory biosafety cabinet. Count the cell number using a cell counter and finally adjust the cell concentration to a value of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cell/mL.</li>
<li>Add 50 μL of the cell suspension into 15 mm of cell culture dish (5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cell/well) inside a standard laboratory biosafety cabinet and culture the cells in 2 mL of cell culture medium.</li>
<li>After 24 h incubation, replace the medium with 2 mL of fresh cell culture medium and add the mito-NP loading GFP-expressing vector at a plasmid concentration of 200 ng/mL. As a control, add the mixture of Lipofectamine 3000 and GFP-expressing vector to the liver fibroblasts at the same plasmid concentration.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The pH of the medium used in this step should be a neutral pH. If the pH value is lower than the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> (∼6.35) of the Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA, add small volume of NaOH aqueous solution (1 M) to adjust the solution pH using a pH meter to a neutral value.</div>
<ol start="38">
<li>After 24 h incubation, remove the medium, wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS solution thrice, and add 2 mL of fresh medium for another 48 h incubation.</li>
<li>Remove culture medium and add 200 nM of MitoTracker Red diluted in 2 mL of HBSS buffer solution.</li>
<li>After 30 min incubation, remove the medium, wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS solution thrice, and stain the nuclei with 1.5 mL of Hoechst 33342 (diluted with PBS at 1:1000 ratio) for 10 min.</li>
<li>Remove the medium, add 2 mL of fresh PBS solution, and use confocal laser-scanning microscope to observe the intracellular GFP expression and colocalization of GFP with mitochondria.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Since the encapsulated vector could gradually be released from the mito-NP, stronger mitochondria-targeting ability and better gene transfection could be achieved when using freshly prepared mito-NP. If large amount of NPs are needed, frozen storage at −80°C is recommended. In addition, in order to observe well-structured mitochondria, the live fibroblasts should be viewed under confocal laser-scanning microscope once the nucleus staining is finished.</div>

<i>In vivo</i> evaluation of mitochondria-targeting ability</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼3 days</div>
<p>To evaluate the <i>in vivo</i> mitochondria-targeting ability, fluorescent dye such as Cy5 is needed to label the circRNA-expressing vector (<a href="#bib16">Zhao et al., 2020</a>), which is then encapsulated into the mito-NP and injected into healthy male C57BL/6J mice (5 weeks old) intravenously.</p>
<ol start="42">
<li>Label circRNA-expressing vector with Cy5 using Label IT Tracker Intracellular Nucleic Acid Localization Kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1–9 to prepare the mito-NP loading Cy5-labeled circRNA-expressing vector.</li>
<li>After washing the NPs with 5 mL of PBS solution thrice, collect the NPs and resuspend the NPs in PBS solution at a vector concentration of 50 μg/mL.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If the Cy5-labeled NPs are not immediately used for the following <i>in vivo</i> experiments, frozen storage at −80°C is needed.</div>
<ol start="45">
<li>Randomly divide six healthy male C57BL/6J mice into 2 groups (n = 3) and intravenously inject 200 μL of mito-NP (50 μg/mL vector-equivalent concentration in PBS solution) or naked Cy5-labeled vector (50 μg/mL in PBS solution).</li>
<li>Twenty-four hours post injection, sacrifice the mice, harvest the major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) and image the major organs by Maestro 2 In-Vivo Imaging System to observe the accumulation of Cy5-labeled vector in each organ.</li>
<li>Cut the mouse liver tissue into tiny pieces and repeat steps 17–29 to extract the primary liver fibroblasts.</li>
<li>Use flow cytometry to analyze and compare the fluorescence intensity of Cy5 in the liver fibroblasts of mice treated with mito-NP or naked Cy5-labeled vector.</li>
<li>Extract the mitochondria from the liver fibroblasts using the commercial kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction and use flow cytometry to analyze and compare the fluorescence intensity of Cy5 in the mitochondria of the liver fibroblasts of mice treated with mito-NP or naked Cy5-labeled vector.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> To eliminate the interference of blood autofluorescence, the harvested organs need to be washed repeatedly with PBS solution.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>At the end of the process, the obtained mito-NP should show a spherical morphology (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A) with an average size of ∼100 nm (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B) and neutral surface charge (zeta potential, ± 5 mV). In addition, the NPs should be well-dispersed in aqueous solution and show good stability (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C).</p>

<p>Regarding the <i>in vitro</i> mitochondria-specific gene delivery, after incubation with the liver fibroblasts, the mito-NP should show stronger mitochondria-targeting ability and better gene transfection compared to the naked vector (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>D and 5E).</p>
<p>In regard to the <i>in vivo</i> mitochondria-specific gene delivery, after intravenous injection into the mice, the mito-NP should show higher accumulation in the liver tissues due to their large size (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>F). More importantly, due to their good mitochondria-targeting ability, more mito-NP should accumulate in the mitochondria of the liver fibroblasts compared to the naked vector (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>G).</p>

<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>In this protocol, there is limitation at the storage of the mito-NP. As the vector, i.e., nucleic acid, is physically encapsulated into the NPs via electrostatic interaction, the vector could be gradually released as time goes by. Frozen storage of mito-NPs at −80°C could significantly inhibit the vector release, however, repeated freeze-thaw cycles would induce destroy of the nanostructure, leading to unsatisfactory experimental results. Our experiences suggest that the optimal experimental results could be achieved when using the freshly prepared mito-NP. If large scale of NPs is needed, frozen storage is necessary after NP preparation. Moreover, before the frozen storage, the NPs are recommended to be divided into different tubes according to the experiment arrangement; and only one tube of NPs should be used for the each experiment to avoid the repeated freeze-thaw cycles.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The Meo-PEG-<i>b</i>-PDPA polymer and mitochondria-targeting peptide TACP are respectively dissolved in DMF and DMSO, and then used for the preparation of the mito-NP. Therefore, the residual organic solvents probably mix in the mito-NP aqueous solution, which may induce potential cytotoxicity.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Since the organic solvents used in this protocol are water miscible, repeated washing the obtained NPs with Hypure water or PBS solution could effectively remove the residual organic solvents.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The vector with relatively large size may restrict its encapsulation into the mito-NP, which ultimately induces low gene transfection efficacy.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Since the encapsulation of the vector is based on its electrostatic interaction with the mitochondria-targeting peptide TACP, increasing the nitrogen/phosphate (N/P) ratio by using more TACP could improve the encapsulation efficiency of the vector.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>As the vector is physically encapsulated into the mito-NP via electrostatic interaction, the vector could be gradually released from the NPs as time goes by.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Frozen storage could significantly inhibit the vector release from the mito-NP. If large amount of NPs are needed, NPs could be divided into different tubes before the frozen storage. Then, only one tube of NPs should be used for the each experiment, which can avoid the destroy of the nanostructure induced by repeated freeze-thaw.</p>
