<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The protocol provided here describes methodologies for making a highly cost-effective, chemically defined medium for culturing hiPSCs we call B8 medium. The typical cost of B8 medium is US$10 per liter, which with modifications included here is more affordable than standard media. We provide simple protocols for making B8 supplement aliquots, making the basal media DMEM/F12, Matrigel-coated plates, thawing, passaging, culturing, and cryopreserving hiPSCs. We show typical differentiation results and provide a comprehensive troubleshooting guide.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib9">Kuo et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) should can be obtained from existing academic hiPSC labs or from commercial sources such as WiCell (<a href="http://wicell.org">wicell.org</a>) or Coriell (<a href="http://coriell.org">coriell.org</a>). hiPSC use should follow institutional guidelines including institutional review board approval and relevant material transfer agreements. We grow our hiPSCs in 5% O<sub>2</sub> (hypoxic) incubators, this hypoxic environment is not essential for this protocol to be successful, but has previously been demonstrated to improve genome stability (<a href="#bib8">Kuijk et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib16">Thompson et al., 2020</a>), reprogramming efficiency (<a href="#bib13">Mathieu et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib18">Yoshida et al., 2009</a>), and maintenance of the pluripotent state (<a href="#bib4">Forristal et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib6">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib12">Mathieu et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib14">Narva et al., 2013</a>). All cell culture steps should be performed in a Class II or higher biosafety cabinet such as a Labconco Logic+. All solutions should be kept sterile, and proper sterile technique should be used throughout.</p>
<p>The protocol detailed here has been in use in our lab for a number of years and validated with hundreds of cell lines. It is imperative to recognize that cells must be cultured on a strict repetitive manner, typically passaging every 3, 3.5, or 4 days. Changing the number of days of culture based on visual inspection is not appropriate, rather cells should be split on schedule and plated at different ratios, typically 1:15 to 1:20 until they typically reach 70%–80% confluent and rhythm has been established. The protocol provided here uses the “low-cost, easier to make” formula variant of B8 medium with lower levels of insulin and transferrin described in (<a href="#bib9">Kuo et al., 2020</a>) (Figure S5C). NRG1 and TGFB3 are used at very low concentrations in this formula, and we have found it not to be cost-effective to make these proteins in house due to comparative poor yield when generating these ourselves. This is likely to be the case for all but the highest use academic labs (&gt;1,000 L per year).</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparation of DMEM/F12</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>We identified DMEM/F12 as the optimal basal media to use in combination with B8 supplement aliquots for the culture of hiPSCs. Now that the cost of growth factors in the B8 supplement aliquots have been reduced, the major cost of B8 medium is the DMEM/F12, which represents 65% of the total cost. This cost of DMEM/F12 varies considerably across laboratories and we have found that our comparably cheap cost ($6.50/L) is not the common case, with the list price of the commonly used Gibco DMEM/F12 ∼10× higher ($64.60/L). In addition, the availability, length of time, and cost of delivery may vary across locations. To combat this and due to our own changing needs as scale increases, where the cost of DMEM/F12 has become prohibitive, we have developed a protocol for the simple generation of DMEM/F12 in 20 L batches from powder. The total cost of powders and a sterile filter for this protocol is $5.22/L.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We have found the most cost-effective version of DMEM/F12 in powder form to be from Corning. This version comes without L-glutamine, HEPES, or sodium bicarbonate which must be added.</div>
<ol>
<li>Fill a clean and autoclaved 20 L polycarbonate carboy with 19 L of Milli-Q water. Place on a high capacity stirrer with a Magnetic PVDF Carboy Stirrer.</li>
<li>Slowly add 2 bottles of DMEM/F12 powder replacing the stirrer occasionally to agitate powder at the bottom of the carboy.</li>
<li>Once the DMEM/F12 is dissolved add 48.8 g of sodium bicarbonate, 71.5 g of HEPES, and 73 g of L-glutamine, and continue to mix until fully dissolved.</li>
<li>Top up to 20 L with Milli-Q water.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Check pH and osmolarity which typically come out at pH 7.1 and 310 osm/L.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> When checking the pH and osmolarity, separate media in 50 mL tubes for each measurement. Use an osmometer to check the osmolarity and correct the value by adding cell culture grade water until the desired value is reached. For pH, corrections should be made using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or hydrochloric acid (HCl) solutions. Then, scale up the values of cell culture grade water, HCl, and/or NaOH for the appropriate final volume of media being made.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Place carboy on a cart and wheel next to a cell culture hood.</li>
<li>Attach the carboy to a peristaltic pump into a PES sterile filtration system at &lt;75 psi.</li>
<li>Inside the cell culture hood, use the system to fill 20 clean and autoclaved 1 L polycarbonate bottles with DMEM/F12. Cap the bottles and store at 4°C until use.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We wash our polycarbonate bottles in a standard scientific glassware washer and autoclave empty on the lowest cycle (15 min, 120°C). Bottles must be allowed to cool before the caps are tightened to prevent loss of shape. Bottles can be autoclaved ∼30 times before the plastic becomes brittle.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Once made, bottles of DMEM/F12 can be kept at 4°C for at least 1 year.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of Matrigel-coated plates</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The use of a low concentration Matrigel (a 1:800 dilution) was optimized and found to work successfully without sacrificing cell proliferation or differentiation capacity (<a href="#bib9">Kuo et al., 2020</a>). Dilutions up to 1:1,000 are still suitable for hiPSC culture, however 1:800 is preferred to avoid batch-to-batch variability in the supplier concentrations and operator error when filling the wells.</div>
<ol>
<li>Thaw a bottle of growth factor-reduced Matrigel overnight at 4°C.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The bottle of Matrigel can be stored at 4°C for over six months in a high-performance refrigerator that is able to maintain a constant temperature. There is no need to aliquot it or place on ice.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Set out 42 × 6-well cell culture plates in a cell culture hood.</li>
<li>Set a P1000 pipettor to 625 μL and have a sterile 1,000 μL tip ready.</li>
<li>Place a 500 mL bottle of 4°C DMEM in cell culture hood.</li>
<li>Briefly take Matrigel bottle out of the 4°C and add 625 μL Matrigel to the DMEM bottle for a dilution of 1:800.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Hold the Matrigel bottle by the neck when transporting the bottle to the cell culture to minimize heat transfer that could cause gelation of the Matrigel.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Any concentration of Matrigel in within the typically suppled range of 8 to 12 mg/mL (see product insert) is suitable for use at 1:800 dilution.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is possible to coat a smaller number of plates by just transferring the appropriate amount of DMEM to a sterile bottle and mixing with the correct volume of Matrigel to maintain the desired 1:800 dilution. For example, to coat only 21 plates, use 250 mL of DMEM and 312.5 μL of Matrigel. Diluted Matrigel solution should not be stored and reused.</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Immediately return the Matrigel bottle to 4°C</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Minimize the time the bottle will be kept out of the 4°C in order to avoid gelation of the Matrigel.</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Mix the Matrigel/DMEM solution by inversion.</li>
<li>For 6 well plates, add 2 mL of Matrigel solution per well.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The addition of 2 mL of Matrigel solution per well of a 6-well plates, instead of a smaller volume, minimizes the likelihood of the wells drying out.</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Place the plates in a 37°C incubator for at least 30 min before use.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Plates can be kept in the incubator for up to 4 weeks without risk of wells drying out.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> If the wells have dried out, the plate should be discarded.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Instead of Matrigel, plates can be coated with Geltrex or Cultrex at the same 1:800 dilution (<a href="#bib9">Kuo et al., 2020</a>), or defined proteins such as recombinant laminin-521, Synthemax II-SC, and vitronectin (<a href="#bib1">Burridge et al., 2014</a>).</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> As an alternative to DMEM, a Matrigel diluent solution can be made from Milli-Q water with 6 mg/L phenol red sodium salt, 140 mg/L sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, and 1,200 mg/L sodium bicarbonate and filter sterilized as above.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>A successful production of B8 medium will allow the generation and maintenance of high quality hiPSCs, also preventing their spontaneous differentiation (<a href="#bib9">Kuo et al., 2020</a>). B8 medium provides a cost-effective alternative for commonly used hiPSC culture media such as E8 (<a href="#bib2">Chen et al., 2011</a>) and mTeSR (<a href="#bib11">Ludwig and Thomson, 2007</a>). After identifying the proper split ratio, hiPSCs can be maintained at a weekend-free media exchange routine minimizing the number of interventions during culture and saving time for the researcher. Our protocol has been thoroughly validated on different hiPSC lines, including genetically-engineered knockout lines, without loss of culture quality or differentiation performance.</p>
<p>Transitioning of live cells cultured in E8, Essential-8 (Gibco), or TeSR-E8 (Stem Cell Technologies) can be performed directly without any need for a transition period. Equally, cells cultured in these media then cryopreserved can be thawed in to B8 medium. Like E8, B8 medium results in cells growing less densely than mTeSR1, hence we recommend that cells cultured in mTeSR1 are split to multiple densities (1:3, 1:6, 1:12) then transitioned to B8 medium 1 day after split. We do not recommend thawing cells cultured in mTeSR1 (or on MEF) directly in to B8 medium, rather recover them in their original medium, then transition to B8 medium.</p>
<p>hiPSC cultured long-term in B8 medium will express high levels of the pluripotency markers SSEA4, POU5F1, SOX2, TRA-1-60 (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Once dissociated, cells will quickly adhere, form colonies before forming a near monolayer after 3 days of growth (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Cells should not be allowed to overgrow and achieve ≥90% confluency (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>E) as this will result in cells leaving the logarithmic growth phase and the culture quality might substantially decrease. In this case, hiPSCs will present greater heterogeneity in the cell cycle phases, which will impact their differentiation potential (<a href="#bib10">Laco et al., 2018</a>). Post-passage overgrown cells will also take longer to expand, might have decreased survivability, and will present unreliable differentiation for some passages.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Readers may be concerned of batch-to-batch variability, we typically make batches of 100–200 B8 supplement aliquots every month and despite using this methodology over 5 years have not experienced a “bad batch,” suggesting the protocol is robust.</p>
<p>Quality control is completed by comparing the previous batch to a new batch using our 12-well Prestoblue assay, detailed in (<a href="#bib9">Kuo et al., 2020</a>). New batches of FGF2-G3 (which we have made once per year) should be assessed for potency using the same assay using 0–100 ng/mL and compared to the published data. Although we have not completed any planned stability tests, anecdotally we have not seen any issues with stability, and sodium selenite, NRG1, TGFB3, and FGF2-G3 aliquots have all been kept for ≥1 year . We have not assessed the long-term stability of the B8 supplement aliquots as these are typically used in ≤6 months.</p>
<p>The protocol described here utilizes FGF2-G3 generated by a core facility or in house and available for purchase from Northwestern as described in (<a href="#bib9">Kuo et al., 2020</a>), 2020. The use of commercial FGF2 increased the cost of the media by more than 4×. Conversely, we found that production of TGFB3 and NRG1 resulted in much lower yields than FGF2-G3 and, in the case of NRG1 require the 6xHis tag to be cleaved further reducing yield. For the small amounts of these two proteins to be used, we have not found it cost-effective to make them in house.</p>
<p>Our protocol has been successfully tested with 100s of different cell lines, either commercial or derived in house. As the number of passages increase, we have found that hiPSCs do start to grow faster in all types of pluripotent culture media, especially over passage 100, and can potentially lose their differentiation potential. The proposed B8 and B8T media in addition to the suggested culture procedures in this protocol cannot revert this biological process.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>When preparing B8 supplement aliquots, L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate does not dissolve in water at the concentration mentioned in the protocol.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Verify if the L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate being used is the L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate trisodium salt, as only this salt can be used at high concentration. If using other salts, change the concentrations accordingly, and pH.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Significant level of cell death is observed after thawing.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that the quality of the frozen cells was high before freezing, as this will affect their survival post thawing. Avoid freezing cells that left the logarithmic growth phase (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>E), passage them 2–3 times to allow them to return logarithmic growth before freezing. Additionally, vials should be transferred to liquid nitrogen within 2–24 h.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Cells are not attaching to the Matrigel-coated plates when passaged.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ascertain the quality of the Matrigel-coated plates, verifying if they have not dried out (see <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). If they have (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B), discard them and coat new plates before passaging the hiPSCs. Make sure the cells were not more than 80% confluent at the time of passaging (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>D). Overgrown cells (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>E) will be contact inhibited and will present decrease quality and variability in their cell cycle stage. This can lead to decreased attachment to the plates, in addition to slow growth after attachment/passaging. Make sure to keep the cells in EDTA for at most 6 min. Keeping cells in EDTA for longer will result in cells detaching from the plate during passaging and being aspirated when replacing the solution with B8T medium. A reduced number of cells will decrease the number of cells that will successfully attach to the plates after passaging, hindering the growth of the hiPSCs. Lastly, as before, check the media date. If B8 and B8T media are more than 1 month old, discard them, and make new.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>hiPSCs are growing slowly after plated.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If hiPSCs overgrew before passaging (&gt;90% confluency, <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>E), they will have left the logarithmic growth phase and will require couple passages before returning to it. If the cells were passaged too early (&lt;60% confluency, <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C), were passaged at too high split ratio (1:15 or 1:20) when they were already growing slowly, or were kept in EDTA for a long interval (&gt;6 min) the number of plated cells will be too small at the beginning of the culture and will take longer for them to return to the correct growth ratio. Therefore, make sure to keep a consistent passaging schedule (number of days) to avoid this process. Make sure that the media exchange schedule is consistent with the desired outcomes and protocols (e.g., weekend-free culture as proposed here). Similar to before, if the Matrigel-coated plates have dried out (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B), the cells will not attach properly or not attach at all, leading to poor growth. Make sure to always use good quality Matrigel-coated plates. Lastly, ascertain that the B8 and B8T media are not more than a month old. If that is the case, make a new set.</p>
