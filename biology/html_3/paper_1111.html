<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Recycling of waste CO<sub>2</sub> to bulk chemicals has a tremendous potential for the decarbonization of the chemical industry. Quantitative analysis of the prospects of this technology is hindered by the lack of flexible techno-economic assessment (TEA) models that enable evaluation of the processing costs under different deployment scenarios. In this protocol, we explain how to convert literature data into metrics useful for evaluation of the emerging electrolysis technologies, derive TEA models, and illustrate their use with a CO<sub>2</sub>-to-ethylene example.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Scope of the model</h3>
<p>This protocol is a method for systematic techno-economic evaluation of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis (CO2R) operating at scales meaningful for the decarbonization of the chemical industry (defined also by some researchers as “defossilization” [<a href="#bib22">Schneider 2021</a>]). The model is applicable to CO2R incorporating gas-diffusion electrodes (GDE) or solid-oxide electrolyzers, both of which allow for achievement of current densities sufficiently high to yield an industrially viable electrolysis processes (<a href="#bib6">Burdyny and Smith 2019</a>). The main focus of this protocol is providing a tool for the assessment of the deployment of the CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis as an add-on to the existing chemical production processes (defined recently as Carbon Capture On-Site Recycling [<a href="#bib2">Barecka et al., 2021a</a>]). Running CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis as an on-site recycling within the operational plants was discussed as economically feasible in the current market and capable of supporting large scale CO2R deployment by giving an economic incentive to run electrolysis on significant scales (<a href="#bib2">Barecka et al., 2021a</a>). Nevertheless, the modeling method presented here is applicable to all CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis systems, both integrated in chemical plants and stand-alone, and we strongly encourage the reader to use this model to evaluate CO2R performance for different applications. Use of the protocol is illustrated by a CO<sub>2</sub>-to-ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) electrolyzer example, noting that reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to products containing two or more atoms of carbon (C2+) is the most complex example among different electrolysis systems discussed in the paper deploying this method. Excel tool related to this paper and available at <a href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/2jpy5233nb/1">https://doi.org/10.17632/2jpy5233nb.1</a> contains also an example of calculations for CO<sub>2</sub>-to-syngas high-temperature electrolysis system.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Structure of the model</h3>
<p>Detailed modeling of any CO2R system is challenging due to the low maturity of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis and the current lack of large-scale application examples. Therefore, to derive metrics meaningful for TEA of emerging technologies, we instead define a system-level model, representing a CO2R reactor with all related equipment, and identify the key inputs and outputs of the system based on the analysis of experimental data, engineering approximations and basic chemical process design rules. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> provides an overview of the proposed methodology.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.3">Comparison to the existing TEA models for CO2R</h3>
<p>Techno-economic models (TEA) for CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis, both already published and the one proposed here, are derived from classical approaches used in chemical engineering based on the estimation of the difference between the cost of manufacturing and projected revenue (<a href="#bib23">Seider et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib9">Farris 2010</a>). Complex TEA approaches for carbon capture and utilization have been discussed thoroughly in conceptual terms (<a href="#bib31">Zimmermann et al., 2020</a>). Looking specifically at CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis field, previous contributions on TEA for CO2R were mostly focused on determining the range of operational parameters under which the CO2R technology can begin to be considered as economically attractive, or investigating which of the potential electrolysis products can be most interesting for CO2R based stand-alone plants (<a href="#bib28">Verma et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib24">Spurgeon and Kumar 2018</a>; <a href="#bib7">Bushuyev et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib15">Luna et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib14">Jouny et al., 2018</a>). Several benchmarks identified in previously published TEA, such as e.g., current density and overpotential, are being now achieved in the laboratory demonstrations.</p>
<p>Hence, we find it insightful to look into TEA again, reformulate the models with more detailed process data available and democratize their use through a Protocol contribution that has not been proposed before in this area. In contrast to the state-of-the-art approaches, we do not build-up the analysis on the assumption of best case scenarios for the Faradaic efficiency or selective production of one product only (<a href="#bib14">Jouny et al., 2018</a>). Instead, we report here guidance on how to extract the experimental data and consider the process complexity as accurately as possible. We aim at supporting the researchers in understanding the prospects of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis for e.g., specific catalyst or application. The Protocol can be also used to generate data for assessments of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis technology performance (stream compositions, energy requirements etc.) that can be used as an input to other TEA methods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, provided protocol is currently the only tool applicable for the evaluation of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis used for both purposes of retrofitting an existing chemical plant or stand-alone CO<sub>2</sub>-based manufacturing. We anticipate that upon progress in the field, this tool will be applicable for the evaluation of the further process improvements and support large-scale adoption of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.4">Proposed timing</h3>
<p>The actual time necessary to realize each calculation step will depend strongly on the prior knowledge of the user regarding e.g., price indicators for renewable electricity, chemicals and CO<sub>2</sub> taxes. We therefore provide timing interval of each step, where its lower bound corresponds to the scenario where the user already has all economic data and only needs to feed this data to the model. The upper bound of the timing interval includes an approximate time necessary to research the market prices and determine the input data.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5 min–4 h</div>
<p>This example focuses on the use of CO2R as a retrofit of the existing chemical plants, which emit waste CO<sub>2</sub> streams that can be converted back to raw materials by means of electrolysis (general concept is depicted in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Therefore, in the first place the requirements for CO<sub>2</sub> recycling inputs/outputs are defined in the context processes where CO2R is envisioned to be embedded.</p>

<ol>
<li>Define the chemical plant where CO2R is to be integrated:
<ol type="a">
<li>In the exemplary deployment of the protocol, we focus on deployment of a CO<sub>2</sub> electrolyzer as a part of an ethylene oxide (EO) production plant (for more details of the concept see the paper deploying this protocol (<a href="#bib2">Barecka et al., 2021a</a>) or another report on technical details of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis integration into ethylene oxide plants (<a href="#bib3">Barecka et al., 2021b</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Define requirements for the input stream:
<ol type="a">
<li>The availability of waste CO<sub>2</sub> stream for recycling (CO<sub>2</sub> flowrate to be converted by the designed system) at a given chemical plant.
<ol type="i">
<li>In this example, we set it to 103 mol/s of high-purity CO<sub>2</sub> stream (as a typical waste stream of CO<sub>2</sub> available at middle-size ethylene oxide plants). Based on reports on industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (<a href="#bib1">Bains et al., 2017</a>), this stream typically contains 98–100% CO<sub>2</sub> and is free of typical impurities to CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction (See <a href="#limitations">Limitations</a> section for further details).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Define the requirements behind the output streams:
<ol type="a">
<li>Intended use of CO2R products.
<ol type="i">
<li>In EO plants: recycling CO2R products stream to the main reactor producing EO.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Targeted products.
<ol type="i">
<li>Ethylene (starting material for EO production).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Potential of other CO2R products for recycling.
<ol type="i">
<li>CO2R systems reported so far do not demonstrate 100% selectivity towards the desired product, so it is necessary to consider whether other minor products of electrolysis can be used at the target application process. Based on EO production requirements, recycled CO2R products stream can flexibly include some unreacted CO<sub>2</sub>, CO and H<sub>2</sub> (see (<a href="#bib3">Barecka et al., 2021b</a>) for details).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Potential for use of CO2R by-product (oxygen).
<ol type="i">
<li>Oxygen can be recycled back to EO reactor as it is typically used for ethylene oxidation to EO.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Potential limitations in CO2R products use.
<ol type="i">
<li>In a hypothetical case, converting a large CO<sub>2</sub> stream available at a given site could yield a stream of CO2R products could be larger than the demand for these products. In case of recycling of CO<sub>2</sub> within the chemical plants, this scenario is not foreseen as CO<sub>2</sub> streams available for conversion are far lower than plant capacities and the demand for feedstocks (see (<a href="#bib2">Barecka et al., 2021a</a>)). However, if a chemical process could valorize only a limited stream of CO2R products, then this must be considered as a constraint and a system converting only a part of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should be designed in such case.</li>

<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Define available waste heat streams. In case if such streams are available at the chemical plant, they can be used as an input to high-temperature electrolysis unit. However, high-temperature (∼800°C) electrocatalysts are reported to yield efficiently products containing only one atom of carbon, so is not applicable for ethylene production and hence not considered in this example.</div>
<h3 id="sec2.3">Extract experimental data</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼<b>2–20 h</b>
</div>
<p>After formulating the requirements towards CO2R system, applicable electrocatalysts need to be identified and experimental data extracted for further modeling. These steps describe how to select experimental data for representative modeling of the CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis technology:</p>
<p>Reactions observed on the cathode and anode side.</p>
<p>Faradaic efficiency (FE; selectivity of the system to deliver the product of interest).</p>
<p>Current density (size of the electrolyzer required for conversion of certain flowrate of CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>Full cell voltage (energy requirement for CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis).</p>
<p>Catalyst stability (demonstrates if the catalyst is promising for industrial applications).</p>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> conversion (influences the overall efficiency of the system).</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> It is not always possible to accurately extract all parameters mentioned above from a single report. Literature offers a wide variety of reports on electrocatalysts, typically focusing on laboratory-scale experiments targeting better understanding of the material properties. While these studies provide crucial insights into the basic science behind the electrolysis and solid data on FE or achievable current densities, they frequently do not optimize full cell voltage, CO<sub>2</sub> conversion, or the long-term stability. Thus, it is crucial to critically compare several reports to derive metrics that will be representable for large-scale optimized CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis systems. Building TEA models based on, e.g., non-optimized full cell voltages observed in the laboratory test, may lead to the misleading conclusion that the technology is not of commercial interest.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Determine experimental data for the input of the process model:

<ol type="i">
<li>Here, we extracted the data on catalyst selectivity (FE) and current density from the report of <a href="#bib27">Vennekoetter et al., 2019</a>.

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We recommend to review if FE reported for all products are equal to 100%. In case of total FE slightly exceeding 100%, e.g., 102%, the numbers should be normalized to 100% to account for the potential experimental error and avoid overestimation of the product flow. If the total FE is lower than 100%, some of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis products might not be reported; identification of these products is crucial for the design of the overall CO2R system.</div>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Long-term stability.
<ol type="i">
<li>Long-term stability test confirms feasibility of 150 h of interrupted CO<sub>2</sub> -to-ethylene electrolysis (<a href="#bib8">Dinh et al., 2018</a>).

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Prospects for recycling of catholyte and anolyte on a large-scale are not yet fully understood. If basic electrolytes are deployed, such as potassium or sodium hydroxide solutions, capture of CO<sub>2</sub> into carbonate/bicarbonate salts is inevitable and the electrolyte would potentially need to be refreshed; however, there no insights into how often that should happen. There are studies demonstrating that captured CO<sub>2</sub> could also degas into CO<sub>2</sub> at the anode side (<a href="#bib16">Ma et al., 2020a</a>), resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> material losses and need for separation step of CO<sub>2</sub> from the oxygen stream produced at the anode. However, most recent contributions in CO2R field consider reactor design with no liquid catholyte at all (“zero-gap assembly” [<a href="#bib27">Vennekoetter et al., 2019</a>]), cascade reactors (<a href="#bib19">Ozden et al., 2021</a>) or deploy acidic catholyte (<a href="#bib11">Huang et al., 2021</a>). These strategies solve the problem of CO<sub>2</sub> capture and degassing at the anode and yield a system with no/ fully recyclable electrolytes. Hence, we anticipate that in large scale deployment of CO2R there will be no significant cost behind electrolyte recycling and no need to separate CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen at the anode side.</div>

Following analysis is based on the most recent report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (<a href="#bib18">Mayyas et al., 2019</a>). The cost model covers all system components related to the catalyst (Platinum and Iridium are considered for water splitting), electrolyzer stack and balance-of-the plant incorporating all systems necessary to operate an electrochemical reactor such as power supply, liquid and gas circulation systems, piping, valves and instrumentation, control and safety-related systems.</p>

Choice of these metrics will depend on the specific deployment of this protocol. For instance, business negotiations towards technology industrial deployment will require metrics useful for the commercial partners, whereas the general understanding of CO2R prospects and guiding the further research uses more intuitive benchmarks. The technology assessment method presented here allows for extraction of data enabling to calculate any of profitability metrics. We illustrate the protocol use with the most widely adopted one: the time required to recover the investment into the project, defined in economic terms as breakeven time, and colloquially used as “return on investment period”. For calculation of other profitability metrics useful in chemical engineering applications, we refer the reader to literature (<a href="#bib20">Peters et al., 2003</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Sensitivity analysis</h3>
<p>Presented calculation method enables to obtain single values for the most important economic performance metrics such as e.g., net value generated by CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis process or the return on investment. To understand the market conditions necessary for CO2R deployment, presented TEA should be performed around a wide range of economic parameters. As the electricity prices and CO<sub>2</sub> taxes have a key influence on CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis costs, these parameters should be varied first to observe their influence on: 1) Return on investment (ROI), which depends strongly on the net value generated by electrolysis; 2) Potential for the reduction of production costs for the target chemical (in our example-ethylene oxide). This metric is meaningful for the case of integration of CO<sub>2</sub> recycling into an existing chemical plant.</p>
<p>Results for the above mentioned metrics determine whereas the process has a potential for an economically viable operation in the given region, under the available electricity prices and justifies further insights into other sources of potential uncertainties. Regardless of the project investments costs, if the electricity price is very far from the economically viable region, CO2R will not be profitable in the given economy, as the cost of running CO2R will exceed the value of produced chemicals.</p>
<p><a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> presents the outcomes of an exemplary sensitivity analysis (see Excel cells A124-I148), computed over a wide range of electricity prices and CO<sub>2</sub> taxes for the case of CO<sub>2</sub> recycling to ethylene at ethylene oxide plants. The range of electricity prices (0.01–0.45 USD/kWh) corresponds to the price with no battery storage in many economies (<a href="#bib13">International Energy Agency 2020</a>), whereas the range of CO<sub>2</sub> taxes covers from zero up to the highest taxes reported (<a href="#bib25">The World Bank 2020</a>). The results indicate that the recycling process has a potential to be economically viable for electricity prices between 0.01–0.045 USD/kWh, as the ROI period is in a reasonable range of several years. Electricity price exceeding 0.045 USD/kWh yields a non-viable process under the assumed price of ethylene. Furthermore, it is possible to reduce the operational costs at ethylene oxide plants by means of CO<sub>2</sub> recycling if the electricity is available for less than 0.045 USD/kWh (in the worst-case, absence of CO<sub>2</sub> taxes). Max. reduction of the operational costs by CO2R is projected to be around 12% (in presence of CO<sub>2</sub> taxes). For further analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> taxes influence, see “<a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>: Why CO<sub>2</sub> tax has only a minor influence on TEA?”.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.2">Uncertainty analysis</h3>
<p>Results of the presented modeling depend strongly on the range of technical parameters that are either derived from experimental demonstrations and do have a margin for improvement upon scale-up, either are coming from engineering approximations for similar systems, as well as on the prices of bulk chemicals, which are highly volatile. We therefore propose to perform an uncertainty analysis to assess the influence of the variation following parameters on the net value generated by CO<sub>2</sub> recycling: 1) Cell voltage: assumed 2V, varies +20%. 2) Faradaic efficiency for ethylene (desired product) production: varies +-10% (yielding 100% efficiency). 3) Ethylene price varies +-20%. 4) Oxygen price varies +-20%. 5) CO<sub>2</sub> tax: up to 119 USD/t of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted.</p>
<p>To compute the uncertainty analysis results, we created described above scenario with the Excel sheet (found under Data – What-if-Analysis – Scenario Manager), so that the user can generate uncertainty reports for new systems/economic data automatically. <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> depicts the results of the analysis (stored in Uncertainty &amp; Statistical anal.

<h2 id="quantitative-and-statistical-analysis">Quantitative and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis presented in previous sections are based on variation of one factor at a time, which is very insightful for the determination of key factors underlying the process economics. However, once the technology becomes more mature and estimates on the technology performance are more precise, it is worthy to vary different factors at the same time and observe their collective influence on the profitability metrics. To understand the statistical trends around the techno-economic assessments, we propose to generate larger data sets by varying the parameters identified in the uncertainty analysis along with the electricity price. We used the attached Excel tool to compute dataset (see Excel Uncertainty &amp; Statistical analysis Tab) by using an automated Scenario manager function. The results are illustrated in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> with a boxplot displaying the minimum, the maximum, the sample median, and the first and third quartiles for the value of return on investment. Illustrated statistical metrics were chosen due to their usefulness for the visualization of both the center and the spread of the data points. Readers interested in alternative methods for uncertainty and sensitivity assessment are encouraged to explore further literature guidelines (<a href="#bib30">Zimmermann et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib26">van der Spek et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib21">Rubin et al., 2021</a>).</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> presents the results of the statistical analysis for two scenarios: a) assuming the investment cost for the early applications of CO2R, corresponding to low TRL (technology readiness level) (the highest investment cost benchmark), b) assuming the investment cost for the widely adopted and scaled-up technology, high TRL level (lower investment cost benchmark). Results of this analysis suggest that under low energy prices (here 0.02–0.03 USD/kWh), potential uncertainties around the technology performance are not likely to significantly affect the ROI period for both low and high TRL levels. However, with a higher electricity costs, uncertainties are rising significantly. Similar trends are observed for both scenarios regarding the investment cost for electrolyzer, and the ROI is proportionally lower upon the investment costs projected for the scaled-up technology.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The presented TEA method is designed to support the general understanding of the applicability and the potential profits generated by CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis; hence, we concentrate only on key contributors to the cost structure and deliberately simplify certain elements of CO2R reactor and the components around it. The calculations are based on a forward-looking assumption that CO2R process metrics demonstrated in the laboratory environment will be feasible to obtain on a large-scale, upon completion of necessary scale-up efforts. These efforts shall particularly address demonstrating long-terms stability of the reactor system and its capacity to deal with potential impurities in the feed CO<sub>2</sub> stream.</p>
<p>Presented calculations steps are especially applicable within (but not limited to) recycling of CO<sub>2</sub> inside the chemical plants where (i) CO<sub>2</sub> stream available for conversion is free of the impurities to the catalyst considered and (ii) the gas product mixture can be further used without the need for separation into pure compounds streams. Other deployment scenarios necessitate additional consideration of CO<sub>2</sub> purification costs and required product separation, which is described under the troubleshooting section.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1: How to use the protocol for stand-alone plants (steps 1–3)?</h3>
<p>Modeling of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis as a stand-alone plant (not integrated within an existing chemical plant) is a simplified case of use of this protocol, as there is no need to consider the interconnections between the existing manufacture and new CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis units (steps 1–3). Instead, the user needs to define available CO<sub>2</sub> sources and the target compound to be produced (e.g., ethylene, syngas; see Excel tabs for examples).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The user needs to adjust the feed CO<sub>2</sub> flowrate (Excel cell B11) to obtain the desired flowrate of product (Excel cell E54), consider the cost of purchase of CO<sub>2</sub> (Excel cell B78), as well as review the price indicators for CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis products (Excel cell B79-84) considering the emerging distribution costs. In stand-alone deployment scenario, CO2R products will likely need to be either transported to another plant or directly to the end user, resulting in the need for establishing a supply chain around the CO2R unit. These costs will strongly depend on the intended use and local market, hence require detailed assessments on case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Further, the user needs to consider the requirements on CO2R product stream composition, as there might be a need to separate the CO2R products (e.g., ethylene) from the rest of the outlet gas stream containing mainly CO<sub>2</sub>. Choice of the particular separation set-up will strongly depend on the CO2R products final application and needs to be designed also on case-by-case basis. Provided protocol helps to understand the potential outputs of scale-up CO2R process and will therefore serve to facilitate the design of separation steps and guide related experimental efforts.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2: How to use the protocol for recently discovered products of CO2R (step 4)?</h3>
<p>While the attached calculation tool covers the most commonly reported products of CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis (see Excel tabs), the community is looking forward to future discovery and scale-up of elegant routes for obtaining more complex chemical molecules directly from CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>In case of analyzing new CO2R products, the user needs to provide experimental data such Faradaic efficiency, full cell voltage, current density and to extend the table “Compounds data and electrocatalysts characterization” (Excel cells A21-I29), as well as basic data such as the number of electrons transferred for each reaction, reaction stoichiometric coefficients, enthalpy of formation and molar mass. The structure of the model makes it deployable across different ranges of compounds, as far as accurate price indicators are provided.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3: How to use the protocol to compare carbon utilization techniques (step 24)?</h3>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis is one among several techniques proposed for valorization of CO<sub>2</sub> to chemicals and fuels and we anticipate that experts in other utilization techniques (e.g., chemical conversion) might seek to compare these routes to CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis-based method.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To ensure a representative comparison, data computed from proposed model should be used for benchmarking against systems that use same feedstocks and deliver the same flowrates and quality of outputs (see definition in Excel cells B11 and E54-61). In such case, this protocol can be used to derive metrics such as e.g., net value generated by electrolysis process (Excel cell B99), return on investment (Excel cell K119) and compare against any other carbon utilization technique.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4: Can the ROI be negative (step 24)?</h3>
<p>The operational costs of running CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis depend strongly on the electric energy prices, hence, if the cost of energy necessary to deliver to the reactor exceeds the value of generated products (e.g., ethylene), the ROI is negative, meaning that the investment will not be economically viable under the assumed price indicators.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Developing of long-term fixed price contracts with the renewable energy suppliers will be necessary for securing stable operational costs and reasonable ROI. Our exemplary data set shows that energy price between 0.02$–0.03$/kWh can secure viable ethylene production costs and ROI.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5: Why CO<sub>2</sub> tax has only a minor influence on TEA (related to expected outcomes sensitivity analysis)?</h3>
<p>Provided example of CO2R deployment in EO plants might surprise the user in terms of limited influence of CO<sub>2</sub> tax on CO2R process economics (e.g., max. potential for operational costs reduction is around 10% with no CO<sub>2</sub> taxes and 12% upon highest CO<sub>2</sub> levies). This is directly related to the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions density (how much of CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted at the chemical plant per kg of final product). For EO plant, emissions density is around 0.38 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>/kg of EO, falling relatively low in comparison to e.g., ammonia production (1.3 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/kg of NH<sub>3</sub>). Furthermore, note that we assume that the price of chemical (e.g., EO) raises to cover the emerging CO<sub>2</sub> taxes (Excel cell B130, B139).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>In economies with a high CO<sub>2</sub> taxation level, it might be more profitable to envision CO2R integration in plants with higher CO<sub>2</sub> emission density. For the overview of plants where CO2R can be used, refer to the article deploying this method (<a href="#bib2">Barecka et al., 2021a</a>).</p>
