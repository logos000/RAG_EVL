<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Advances in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have led to the modality dominating translational cancer research; however, a standardized protocol for evaluating such therapies <i>in vitro</i> is needed. This protocol details the <i>in vitro</i> preclinical evaluation of CAR-T cell therapies for glioblastoma (GBM), including target cell cytotoxicity and T cell proliferation, activation, and cytokine release assays.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.04.008">Vora et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Flow gating strategy: Forward scatter (FSC)-height vs. side scatter (SSC)-height is used as the initial gate to exclude debris. Doublet cells are excluded using an FSC-height vs FSC-width gate. Viability gate is set using 7-AAD to exclude non-viable cells. Isotype control or an unstained control is used to set the gate for expression of CD3, CD25, and CD69 where the gate is drawn to exclude baseline expression of fluorophores. Expression of CD25/CD69 is analyzed on gated CD3 population.</div>
<p>The percentage of T cells positive for each marker, in addition to MFI (median fluorescence intensity) per cell reflects the degree of activation occurring in the cells, which can be compared between CAR-T and control CAR-T cells to determine specificity of the CAR and any off-target effects that may be taking place.</p>

For a detailed protocol, please refer to the BD™ Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Human Th1/Th2 Cytokine Kit Instruction Manual (<a href="#bib1">BD Biosciences, 2019</a>). Briefly, supernatant or provided cytokine standard solutions are serially diluted and cytokine bead suspensions are added. Beads are then washed and used in flow cytometry to quantify presence of TNF-α and IFN-γ cytokines.</li>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The cytotoxicity assay should show increasing target cell lysis with increasing E:T ratios, while control CAR-T cells should continuously show low lysis.</p>
<p>The proliferation assay should show CAR-T cell proliferation increasing significantly upon co-culture with target cells compared to control CAR-T cells and CAR-T cells without target cell co-culture.</p>
<p>The activation assay should show a large fraction of CAR-T cells expressing CD25 and CD69 activation markers as shown in <a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>, whilst this expression should be limited for control CAR-T cells.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p><i>In vitro</i> co-culture-based assays provide valuable insights into the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapies but are inherently limited by several factors. Culturing of cell lines can allow for selection and cultural artifacts, and depending on the cell line, variation may occur. Additionally, the complex tumor immune microenvironment can have varying and unpredictable effects on immunotherapies not seen <i>in vitro</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>in vitro</i> cytotoxicity assays are done in small volumes where effector molecules are in close proximity to each other. CAR-T cell cytotoxicity can be enhanced by this clustering and intracellular signaling can be amplified, potentially exaggerating cytotoxicity values, known as the bystander effect. However, this assay has been effective at demonstrating relative cell killing and continues to be a reliable proxy of CAR-T cell efficacy.</p>
<p>CAR-T cell proliferation is measured via the presto blue assay which measures cell viability and thus cannot distinguish between an actively dividing cell and one in a quiescent state. Proliferation is thus calculated as an arbitrary fluorescence reading correlated to the number of live cells. Regardless, changes in viable cell count directly reflect and can be used to accurately assess CAR-T cell proliferation when the same number of cells are initially plated. Further, changes in viable cell count upon co-culture of CAR-T cells with target cells can be used to assess target cell-induced proliferation.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Low CAR transduction efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Due to the “pooled” approach of assessing the entire T cell population, low transduction efficiency can make differences between CAR-T and control CAR-T cell results indistinguishable, even for effective therapies. Enrichment for CAR-transduced T cells can be done prior to assays using a CAR-expressed marker to resolve this. See (<a href="#bib7">Vora et al., 2020</a>) for conceptual details on this.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Transfection of target cells with luciferase plasmid is not feasible or has low efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>For cells in which stable transfection with luciferase plasmid (<a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a>, steps 1–6) is not feasible, other measures of cytotoxicity are available which don’t require a reporter gene (<a href="#bib4">Kiesgen et al., 2021</a>). Low transfection can be overcome by electroporating target cells with luciferase mRNA (<a href="#bib5">Omokoko et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Low CAR-T cell viability.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>T cells are very sensitive to handling, and as such, resuspending vigorously can result in high amounts of cell death. T cells should be handled gently at all points in the protocol and handling should be kept to a minimum.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>High cytotoxicity or activation in non-targeting control CAR-T cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Prior to final reading during the cytotoxicity (step 12) or activation (step 34) assays, prolonged co-culturing may lead to non-specific effects and increase killing or activation for both CAR-T and control CAR-T cells. If controls show high cytotoxicity or activation, the readout time may need to be optimized and include shorter incubation time.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Non-targeted control CAR may express activation markers due to culturing and expansion. This is acceptable so long as the targeting CAR shows much greater activation.</div>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Optimum cytotoxicity occurs prior to readout timepoint.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>While readout of the proliferation assay usually occurs after a 24–48 h co-culture of CAR-T cells with target cells (step 17), this period can be shortened or the assay can be read out several times within the period to gain more resolution of cytotoxicity at earlier time points.</p>
