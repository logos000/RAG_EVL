<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Small-molecule inhibitors have been instrumental in uncovering the biological importance of poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), a family of enzymes involved in wide-ranging aspects of cell biology. However, few PARP inhibitors are tested against the entire family of PARPs. This makes it impossible to confidently assess the role of a single PARP in cellular processes using small molecules. Here, we detail a PARP activity screening and inhibitor testing assay (PASTA) for determining relative selectivity of PARP inhibitors.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib4">Kirby et al. (2018)</a>.</p>

<li>All proteins should be in hand with concentration determined.</li>
<li>800× DMSO stocks of compounds should be made up.</li>
<li>All buffers (unless noted that fresh is need) should be prepared.</li>
<li>QuantaRed reagents should be warmed to 22°C–25°C.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Cloning</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3–10 days</div>
<p>To begin, identify which PARPs you wish to test in your screen, and whether you would like to measure ADP-ribosylation of a target protein (i.e., SRPK2, histones, etc.) or auto-ADP-ribosylation, as this will dictate whether an activating cofactor needs to be added at step 6 of the assay, and whether buffer (auto-ADP-ribosylation) or PARP enzyme (ADP-ribosylation of a target protein) is added in step 8 of the protocol. Once determined, the recombinant proteins and reagents for the assay must be obtained.</p>
<p>Some recombinant PARPs are commercially available, but for best results we recommend expressing and purifying the enzymes with a His-SUMO tag. cDNA of full-length or truncated PARP enzymes can be obtained from various commercial suppliers (Genscript, DNASU plasmid repository, Addgene, etc.) and cloned into a pET-His6-SUMO-TEV LIC cloning vector (Addgene plasmid # 29653) by a standard isothermal assembly protocol using the Gibson assembly mix (NEB).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Full-length PARPs are preferable for inhibitor testing as they most accurately reflect selectivity in cells, however some PARP family members are prohibitively difficult to work with as full-length constructs, for example, PARP14 and PARP4 (<a href="#bib5">Kirby and Cohen, 2019</a>). In these instances, we recommend using a truncated construct comprising the catalytic domain and the immediately adjacent domains. In developing this assay, we found that constructs comprising only the catalytic domain of some PARPs led to higher signal to noise compared to the full-length proteins in this assay; additionally, some compounds that potently inhibited the catalytic domain variant did not inhibit the full-length PARP (<a href="#bib7">Morgan et al., 2018</a>).</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">General expression and purification of His-SUMO-tagged PARP enzymes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼5 days</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> SRPK2, a generalizable pseudo-target for most PARPs that can be extensively ADP-ribosylated by all active PARPs <i>in vitro</i>, can be expressed and purified using this same protocol. This assay was optimized to assess either ADP-ribosylation of a target using SRPK2 or auto-ADP-ribosylation using an active PARP bound to the plate. SRPK2 has been previously established as a target for several PARPs and used as a substrate for inhibitor screens for PARP10 and PARP15 (<a href="#bib8">Venkannagari et al., 2013</a>). In developing this assay, we have found that this holds true for every member of the PARP family.</div>

<p>The luminescence data collected should have a signal to noise ratio of 5- to 50-fold and there should not be significant variance between biological replicates. If you are assessing the IC50 of an active compound there should be a clear dose response curve as shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. See following section for a detailed description and example of how to analyze this data.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>Depending on the activity of the PARP being tested, the signal to noise (STN) can vary from 5- to 50-fold; in our experience, any results with a STN ratio less than 5 should be considered suspect. No issues of evaporation, signal loss in wells at the edge of the plate, or signal interference from adjacent wells have been observed.</p>
<p>Raw luminescence data can be processed in a simple spreadsheet or graphing program such as Prism GraphPad. To process raw data from the plate reader, use the following equation on each data point:<br> <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/486-Si1.jpg" alt="Si1.jpg"><br>where Lumi<sub>sample</sub> is the signal for an individual compound concentration (column 2, <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>; <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>), Lumi<sub>background</sub> is the signal from a well with no PARP enzyme, and Lumi<sub>Max</sub> the signal from a well with DMSO (or other compound vehicle). We recommend normalizing data to the DMSO control treatment to account for different activity levels of each PARP when comparing relative efficacy of a compound across multiple PARP family members.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>It is important to note that <i>in vitro</i> screening does not always accurately reflect cellular activity of given PARP enzyme. The compounds tested in this assay have been taken forward to cellular studies were shown to have comparable selectivity and potency in cells, with the notable exception of compounds tested <i>in vitro</i> against a truncated PARP10 construct consisting of the catalytic domain compared with full-length PARP10 in cells (<a href="#bib7">Morgan et al., 2018</a>). This assay is most appropriate for determining relative selectivity and potency of small-molecule inhibitors of PARPs, and for assessing ADP-ribosylation levels by individual PARPs under various conditions of time, temperature, concentration, cofactors, etc.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Insufficiently active PARP is most commonly the result of low purity protein preps with inaccurately calculated concentrations, PARP enzyme that has degraded over time or due to mishandling, or forgetting to include activating cofactors.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We recommend determining the purity and concentration of all proteins using western blots and in-gel concentration curves with a known standard rather than relying on Bradford reagent or similar. It is important to remember that PARP1 and PARP2 require damaged DNA for full activity and PARP3 requires an activating 5′-nick dumbbell RNA (<a href="#bib6">Langelier et al., 2014</a>). If a particular PARP still has low ADP-ribosylating activity we suggest testing activity with higher concentrations of 6-alkyne-NAD<sup>+</sup> (up to 400 μM). If you are testing auto-ADP-ribosylation with a PARP bound directly to the Ni-NTA plate low activity could also be the result of low binding of the enzyme. In this instance we recommend extending the chelation step to 2 h at RT.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The preparation of the click reaction solution, though simple, is arguably the most sensitive step in this assay. Improper order of addition, insufficient mixing, or insufficiently fresh and potent reducing agent can all lead to failure of this step, which cannot be detected until the end of the assay when the QuantaRed chemiluminescent reagent will produce little to no signal.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is crucial that you use freshly dissolved TCEP and follow the order of addition given in the protocol, mixing well after each step. The best indicator that you have made the click reaction solution correctly is a pale blue tinge to the final solution as it is added to the plate. If there is no blue tinge, remake the click reaction solution with fresh TCEP, or a slightly increased concentration of TCEP (up to 3 mM), will usually solve the problem.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The QuantaRed chemiluminescent solution is extremely sensitive and fast acting, which makes it ideal for detecting low levels of ADP-ribosylation. However, with more active PARPs the solution can easily oversaturate if left too long without quenching.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When adding the QuantaRed chemiluminescent solution be sure to have the quenching solution ready to add within 1 min, before any wells become bright magenta.</p>
