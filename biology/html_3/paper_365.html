<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Targeted drug delivery to pancreatic islet β cells is an unmet clinical need. β cells possess a uniquely high Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration, and integrating Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding activity into a small molecule can bias drug accumulation and activity toward β cells. This protocol can be used to evaluate a molecule’s capacity to chelate islet Zn<sup>2+</sup>, accumulate in islets, and stimulate β cell-selective replication in mouse pancreas. One obstacle is establishing an LC-MS/MS-based method for compound measurement. Limitations include target compound ionizability and the time-sensitive nature of some experimental assay steps.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib8">Horton et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>For the islet Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation assay, molecules with the ability to bind, or chelate, Zn<sup>2+</sup> in islet sections will compete with TSQ fluorescence. Results of this assay allow one to determine whether a small molecule, either novel or established, can chelate Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the context of pancreatic islets. When potential chelators are titrated, inhibition of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-TSQ fluorescence can be used to calculate the IC<sub>50</sub> and Hill slope n<sub>H</sub>. Especially high-affinity chelators such as TPEN and DPA derivatives display a Hill slope &gt;1. Non-chelating (or weakly chelating) molecules will not compete with TSQ for islet Zn<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence. This assay enables identification of chelation motifs with the potential to promote β cell selective accumulation before investing in more resource-intensive assays.</p>
<p>Based on experience, molecules that robustly chelate Zn<sup>2+</sup> in pancreatic islets accumulate in β cells as assessed by LC-MS/MS. This accumulation can be measured by comparing compound levels in islet and exocrine tissues. Additionally, the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of accumulation may be determined by comparing compound levels in the absence and presence of the strong Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelator TPEN. Thus far, only compounds that display a Hill slope &gt;1 in the islet Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation assay exhibit TPEN-sensitive islet accumulation. Compounds that do not chelate islet Zn<sup>2+</sup>, or do so weakly, are not anticipated to accumulate in islets in a TPEN-dependent or tissue-specific manner.</p>
<p>Extending the utility of these chelation-focused assays, the β cell replication selectivity assay allows one to determine whether a molecule displays a proclivity toward β cell replication induction relative to zinc-deficient non-β cells. For example, the molecule 4877-EXT-DPA induces 8-fold higher β cell replication compared to non-β cells. This effect is not preserved when chelation is attenuated. Thus, this assay may establish that a molecule exerts β cell selective replication-promoting activity.</p>
<p>Finally, these three experiments integrate well into a combined approach to identify and characterize Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding-dependent β cell targeting molecules. While the first two assays are explicitly focused on characterizing the Zn<sup>2+</sup> phenomena of binding/chelation and accumulation in β cells, the third assay has no explicit Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependence. Thus, the protocol for assessing β cell selective replication is broadly applicable to assessing the selectivity of β cell replication-stimulating molecules. In this protocol, β cell selective replication is the demonstrated readout for the β cell selectivity established in small molecules by Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent binding and accumulation.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>TSQ-Zn<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence in islets after treatment with potential chelators was determined. Initially, these data were normalized to TPEN-treatment (0% fluorescence) and vehicle-treatment (100% fluorescence). Fluorescence after treatment with chelators was compared to vehicle-treated islet fluorescence with a pairwise Student’s t test. For chelator accumulation studies by LC-MS/MS, chelator and non-chelator concentrations were quantified using a standard curve generated from the linear peak area portion of the curve. Concentrations (nM) were normalized to total protein (g/L) as measured by the DC Protein assay. Comparisons were made with a pairwise Student’s t test. β cell replication was calculated by dividing the number of cells positive for both insulin and Ki-67 by the number of cells positive for insulin. The minimal effective (Ki-67 induction) concentration (EC<sub>min</sub>) was calculated by a pairwise Student’s t test relative to DMSO-treated wells. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad (Prism).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>If the aqueous solubility of a compound is low, assessment of islet Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation may require adjusting the initial screening concentration to below 500 μM. Compounds that autofluoresce in the 350–400 nm range are incompatible with this assay. Notably, this pancreatic section-based assay is time consuming, since it requires serial staining of sections for each test compound concentration. Additionally, given the use of unfixed frozen sections, this assay is time-sensitive and must be performed rapidly (&lt;10 min). In contrast to DPA-based motifs, some chelators are non-Zn<sup>2+</sup>-selective, which could lead to non-β cell-selective accumulation. Thus, it is important to select molecules known to preferentially bind Zn<sup>2+</sup> or establish alternative assays to assess chelation of other metals.</p>
<p>For LC-MS/MS-based accumulation, compounds must be ionizable by MS/MS and exhibit an acceptable LC elution pattern. Additionally, wash steps must be performed rapidly to avoid sample loss/dilution.</p>
<p>For determining a β cell-selective replication response, the investigator must have expertise in the islet isolation technique. Because this replication assay is relatively lengthy from start to finish, low-islet purity will favor fibroblast contamination, which impairs β cell survival and replication.</p>
