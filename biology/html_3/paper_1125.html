<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Immunocompetent pet dogs develop spontaneous, human-like cancers, representing a parallel patient population for the investigation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapies. We have optimized a retrovirus-based protocol to efficiently CAR transduce primary T cells from healthy and tumor-bearing dogs. While transduction efficiencies and CAR-T expansion vary among dogs, CAR expression is typically higher and more stable compared with previous protocols, thus enabling human and comparative oncology researchers to use the dog as a pre-clinical model for human CAR-T cell research.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00611-0/sref6">Panjwani et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The steps below describe how to generate a clinical scale canine CAR T product from canine peripheral mononuclear cells. Stable and efficient CAR transduction and expression is achieved by means of retroviral vectors. Before starting, dog-specific activating beads should be prepared. The dog-specific activating beads recapitulate the functional features of the equivalent human reagent used in human CAR T trials and enable easy and effective activation of canine lymphocytes required for retroviral transduction.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 days</div>
<ol>
<li>Prepare Buffer 1 and 2.
<ol type="a">
<li>Buffer 1: Dilute 1 mL Sodium Borate Buffer (0.5 M, pH 8.5) with 4 mL H<sub>2</sub>O (final concentration 0.1 M). Filter buffer 1 through sterile 0.22 μm unit and use immediately.</li>
<li>Buffer 2: Dissolve 0.1 g bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 10 mL PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ to obtain a 1% w/v BSA stock solution. Dilute 1 mL BSA stock solution with 9 mL PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ to make a 0.1% w/v BSA blocking solution. Add 40 μL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) to a final concentration 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. Filter buffer 2 through sterile 0.22 μm unit and use within 24 h. Store at 4°C until use.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Vortex Dynabeads<sup>TM</sup> M-450 Tosylactivated vial for at least 60 s to completely resuspend the beads.</li>
<li>Transfer 1 mL beads, containing 4 <b>×</b> 10<sup>8</sup> beads, to a 2 mL sterile microcentrifuge tube.</li>
<li>Wash the beads by adding 1 mL of Buffer 1 and carefully pipette them up and down 15 times.</li>
<li>Place the washed beads on the DynaMag magnet for at least 1 min. Remove and discard supernatant when it appears clear. Aspiration of the supernatant must happen without moving the tube or disturbing the beads. Remove the tube from the magnet.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 4 and 5 for a total of two washes.</li>
<li>Resuspend the beads in 600 μL Buffer 1 and while mixing add 100 μL anti-CD28 (clone 1C6) and 100 μL anti-CD3 (clone CA17.2A12) antibodies, i.e., 100 μg of each antibody, up to 800 μL total volume.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Anti-CD28 clone 5B8 can be used in place of anti-CD28 clone 1C6. The volume of antibodies and Buffer 1 should be adjusted to have 100 μg of each antibody in Buffer 1 up to 800 μL final volume.</div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Incubate for 15 min at 20°C–25°C. During the incubation, prepare 10 mL Blocking Buffer by dissolving BSA in Buffer 1 to a final concentration of 0.1% w/v. Filter Blocking Buffer through sterile 0.22 μm unit. At the end of the incubation, add 200 μL of blocking buffer to the bead-antibody mixture and mix by gently pipetting up and down 15 times.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Blocking buffer can be stored at 4°C for 2–7 days.</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Incubate for 24 h at 37°C on a rotator with gentle tilting and rotation.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This can be incubated at 20°C–25°C, but lower temperatures may require longer incubations.</div>
<ol start="10">
<li>At the end of incubation, remove unbound antibodies by placing the tube on DynaMag magnet for at least 1 min. When the supernatant is clear and without moving the tube or disturbing the beads, aspirate and discard the supernatant. Then, remove the tube from the magnet.</li>
<li>Wash by adding in 1 mL Buffer 2 and pipetting up and down 15 times to mix. Incubate for 5 min at 2°C–8°C with gentle tilting and rotation. Remove washing buffer as in step 11. Repeat for a total of two washes.
<ol type="a">
<li>During the last incubation, prepare 10 mL Buffer 3 by dissolving BSA in 0.2 M Tris (pH 8.5) to a final concentration of 0.1% w/v. Filter buffer 3 through sterile 0.22 μm unit and use immediately.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Unused buffer can be stored at 4°C for 2–7 days.</div>
<ol start="12">
<li>After removal of the last wash buffer, resuspend beads in 1 mL Buffer 3 and incubate for 4 h at 37°C to deactivate remaining free tosyl groups.</li>
<li>Remove Buffer 3 by placing the tube on DynaMag magnet as described in step 11.</li>
<li>Wash once with 1 mL Buffer 2 as described in step 12.</li>
<li>Resuspend the Dynabeads in 1 mL Buffer 2 to obtain 4 <b>×</b> 10<sup>8</sup> beads/mL.</li>
<li>Transfer to 50 mL conical tube and dilute 1-in-10 adding 9 mL of Buffer 2. Make sure you rinse the previous microcentrifuge tube to avoid loss of beads.</li>
<li>Mix diluted beads by vortexing for at least 60 s.</li>
</ol>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Immediately divide into 1–2 mL aliquots and remove 20 μL for counting on hemocytometer to confirm concentration of 4 <b>×</b> 10<sup>7</sup> beads/mL.</div>
<ol start="18">
<li>The beads are coated and ready for use.</li>
</ol>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> As preservative, Sodium Azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>) can be added to the ready-to-use beads to a final concentration of 0.02%, e.g., 200 μL of 1% NaN<sub>3</sub> in 10 mL beads.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Coated dynabeads should be stored at 2°C–8°C and can be used for up to 2 years. While the use of BSA and/or EDTA and/or NaN<sub>3</sub> may be omitted, their omission could reduce the beads’ shelf life, in which case we recommend using them within 6 months of preparation.</div>

<h2 id="step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</h2>
<p>The method below provides step-by-step details to effectively engineer primary canine T cells. Compared to previously published methods (<a href="#bib6">Panjwani et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib8">Sakai et al., 2020</a>), our implemented protocol based on use of RD114 pseudotyped viral vectors and activation of canine T lymphocytes via anti-canine CD3/CD28-coated beads enables high transduction efficiencies using a single infection. Of note, we have also successfully employed chimeric RD114 and VSVG pseudotyped retrovirus for canine T cell transduction. While chimeric pseudotyped retrovirus is not necessary to efficiently engineer canine primary T cells, this strategy allows more efficient transduction of human cells compared with RD114-only pseudotyped virus, thus enabling side-by-side comparative, mechanistic studies in dog and human cells. For canine clinical trials, our retroviral vector of choice is MSGV1, which has been safely employed to generate CAR T cell products used in the treatment of human cancer patients without evidence of replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) production.</p>
<h3 id="sec3.1">Production of RD114 pseudotyped retrovirus</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4 days</div>
<p>High titers of RD114 retrovirus can be produced by transfecting HEK 293T cells in 10 cm dishes. The final yield is usually 10–12 mL per dish. Several dishes can be transfected to produce clinical scale virus stocks, which can be stored as supernatants at -80°C in the long term and for at least 2 years without loss of their transduction potential. No special producing cell lines, ultracentrifuges or concentrating agents are required, making this method versatile and easy to perform in most laboratories. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> outlines the main steps of our procedure to produce RD114 pseudotyped virus supernatants.</p>

<li>12–18 h prior to transfection (early afternoon on the day before), seed HEK 293T cells in 10 cm dishes at 4 <b>×</b> 10<sup>6</sup> cells per dish in 10 mL HEK 293T media. Gently rock the dish to ensure even cell distribution and return to 37°C incubator.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Health of HEK 293T is a key determinant for high retroviral titers. When seeding them for transfection, HEK 293T cells should be a single cell suspension grown to 70%–80% confluency, &gt;90% viable and not passaged more than 25 times (see <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting, problem 1</a> for further details). The number of HEK 293T can be modified based on the time of transfection on the following day. If transfection is performed after &gt;18h, &lt;4 <b>×</b> 10<sup>6</sup> cells per dish should be plated to avoid overgrowth.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the day of transfection, check HEK 293T under an inverted microscope to confirm that they are evenly distributed and 70%–90% confluent. If so, proceed to transfection as follow:
<ol type="a">
<li>transfer 4 mL HEK 293T media per dish into a sterile 50 mL conical tube and let warm to 37°C in a water bath.</li>
<li>For each virus to be produced, transfer 15 μL Lipofectamine 2000/dish into a sterile conical tube containing 1.4 mL transfection media/dish. Mix by gently flicking the tube, without pipetting or vortexing, and avoiding bubbles, as this may cause oxidation of lipofectamine cationic lipids and reduced transfection efficiency. Incubate the lipofectamine dilution at 20°C–25°C for ≤14 min.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If transfecting &gt;3 dishes/virus, consider preparing 1 tube for up to 3 dishes to avoid prolonged incubations between the mix preparation and the last transfections.</div>
</li>
<li>During the lipofectamine/media incubation, prepare the plasmid master mix by combining the Gag/Pol (GP) packaging plasmid, the RD114 (R) envelope plasmid and the MSGV1.CAR (M) plasmid in a sterile microcentrifuge tube. We use a molar ratio of GP:R:M = 1:1.5:3–5 for a total of 21–23 μg plasmid DNA/dish in up to 100 μL transfection media/dish.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Use endotoxin-free maxiprep kits to produce plasmid DNA. Verify that DNA is predominantly supercoiled after maxiprep on an agarose gel, as relative increases in the proportion of nicked/linear DNA significantly impair viral titers.</div>
</li>
<li>Once Lipofectamine 2000 incubation is complete, carefully add plasmid mixtures to the center of the tube(s), gently flick to mix and incubate for ≤25 min at 20°C–25°C.</li>
<li>At the end of the incubation, take HEK 293T dish(es) from the incubator and completely remove media. Using a 2 mL pipette, immediately and carefully add the lipofectamine-plasmid mix dropwise (∼ 1.5 mL). Cover the entire layer of cells, then gently rock the dish back and forth for 30–60 s to evenly distribute the transfection complexes.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Handle 293T gently but quickly. To avoid detaching, HEK 293T should not be kept out of the incubator and/or without media and/or in direct contact with the lipofectamine-plasmid mix for too long. If transfecting several dishes, proceeding with set of 3 transfections at a time may help prevent unwanted delays.</div>
</li>
<li>Gently tilt the dish and slowly add ∼3.5 mL warm HEK 293T media without dislodging the cells. Tilt the dish back, then gently rock back and forth to ensure even distribution of the media/transfection complexes and return to the incubator for 6 h.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> After addition of the warm media, the total volume should not exceed 6 ml per dish.</div>

<ol start="3">
<li>6 h after transfection, completely replace the transfection media with 6 mL pre-warmed HEK 293T media and return the plate to the 37°C incubator.</li>

<li>Thaw virus on ice for 20 min, then complete thawing at 20°C–25°C.</li>

<li>On a parallel 96-well round-bottom plate (virus-dilution plate), pipette 125 μL K562 media per well following the same pattern. Leave the first row empty. Then, add 250 μL of the virus to the top well of each column.</li>
<li>With a multichannel pipette, prepare a 2-fold dilution series by transferring 125 μL of viral supernatant from row-1 wells to row-2 wells of the virus-dilution plate. Gently pipette up and down ∼6 times to mix the virus supernatant and K562 media. After the last mix, without discarding the tips, carry 125 μL down from row-2 to row-3 wells. Follow down to row-7 wells. Do not add any virus into row-8 wells.</li>
<li>Transfer 100 μL of virus and dilution series from each well of column A of the virus-dilution plate to the corresponding K562 cell column of the K562-titration plate. Repeat for each column and, when done, incubate at 37°C for 72 h.</li>
<li>After 72 h, transfer cells to FACS tube, proceed to CAR labeling as required (see below step 36 for details on our CAR labeling reagents and protocol) and determine transduction efficiency (TE) by flow cytometry. A representative K562 TE profile is shown in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>.

</li>
<li>To determine the functional titer of the virus batch, select the point that most accurately represents the number of transduced cells. For TE&lt;1%, flow cytometry may not be accurate enough. For TE&gt;20%, multiple vectors are more likely to infect each positive cells, leading to underestimation of the number of transducing particles. TE values within the range of 1%–20% are usually associated with the most accurate estimate (<a href="#bib2">Giry-Laterrière et al., 2011</a>). Once chosen the appropriate point, use the corresponding percentage of positive cells (F) and virus dilution (D) to determine the number of viral vectors per mL (TU/mL) as detailed in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Titration could be performed using different cells lines (e.g., 293T, Jurkat cells), vessels (U bottom 96-well plates), cell numbers (e.g., 100,000 cells), fold-dilutions (e.g., 3-fold), and strategies (e.g., additional polybrene or spinoculation). Such variations will result in different estimated TU/mL values and may require further trial transductions of primary canine T cells to identify and validate the most appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI).</div>

<p>The goal of the following steps is to purify canine T lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), i.e., monocytes, granulocytes, B lymphocytes and any potential circulating myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC), that can reduce efficiency of CAR engineering particularly in samples obtained from canine cancer patients. We routinely perform a negative selection to enrich for T cells. However, we have also successfully purified T cells by positive selection using anti-CD5 primary antibody, followed by labeling with appropriate MicroBead-conjugated secondary antibody.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Obtain peripheral blood sample from healthy dog or canine cancer patient and isolate PBMCs by gradient centrifugation using standard, sterile media and protocols optimized for isolating human lymphocytes, such as Ficoll-Paque Plus or Histopaque®-1077 (see manufacturer’s recommendations for Ficoll-Paque and Hstopaque-1077). If available, leukapheresis products may provide higher initial numbers of T cells, which may be particularly useful for clinical scale manufacturing of canine patient derived, autologous CAR T cells.</li>
<li>To remove any residual isolation media, resuspend isolated mononuclear cells in at least an equal volume of 1<b>×</b> PBS without Ca++ and Mg++, e.g., 25 mL cell suspension and 25 mL PBS. Centrifuge at 500 <b>×</b> <i>g</i> for 10 min, and carefully aspirate supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Repeat twice.</li>
<li>After the second wash resuspend in up to 50 mL T cell medium (TCM) and obtain cell count and viability using Trypan Blue.</li>
<li>Calculate the amount of required antibodies (mAb), FcR blocking reagent and TCM in which to label the cells to perform T cell enrichment, as shown in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. Put TCM on ice to keep it cold throughout the selection.

<p>Retroviral transduction requires rapidly dividing T cells. The steps below describe effective activation of T cells for ∼44–48 h with anti-canine CD3 and anti-canine CD28 mAb-coated beads in the presence of IL-2. We use cross-reactive recombinant human IL-2. Other cytokines such as IL-15, IL-7 and IL-21 are not necessary to successfully transduce canine T cells, but they may be included from the first day of activation to promote better recovery after thawing and preserve a more favorable T cell memory profile in the long term. Activation of 1.5 <b>×</b>10<sup>7</sup> cells is usually sufficient to achieve clinically relevant products. 1–2 <b>×</b>10<sup>6</sup> cells are suitable for trial transductions and/or small-scale studies aiming to test the ability of a donor/patient specific cell preparation to be gene engineered and to perform pilot experiments, such as screening of new CAR constructs and immunotherapy combinations.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4 hours</div>
<p>On day +4, we assess CAR T transduction efficiency by flow cytometry. Prior to flow cytometric analysis, activating beads and bead-bound cells are removed on a magnet separator. Identity and purity of CAR cells are then evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry using a CAR and T cell specific panel. Our anti-canine CD20 CAR harbors a murine scFv that can be detected via polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulin reagents. Different scFv may require different detection reagents. Assessment of co-engineered ‘marker genes’ can also be used as surrogate of CAR expression. The flow cytometry panel and labeling procedure will need to be optimized accordingly.</p>
<p>Bead removal: 1 h</p>
<p>Flow cytometry assessment: 3 h</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Recover cells from RetroNectin coated wells by gently pipetting up and down several times. Transfer and pool cells into a suitable 15 or 50 mL conical tube. Remove an aliquot for counting and viability check. Ideally, cell density should be &gt;1 <b>×</b>106/mL prior to debeading.</li>
<li>Note down the cell number and label a new flask or plate, that will receive the unbound cell fraction. Place the tube in appropriate DynaMag magnet for 2 min to allow the beads to migrate to the side.</li>
<li>With a suitable serological pipette, carefully remove cell suspension from the middle of the tube and transfer to the new, labeled culture vessel.</li>
<li>Rinse well(s) with the same volume of TCM to recover any residual cells. Remove tube from magnet and resuspend beads with the media used to wash the well(s). Repeat steps 31–32 and combine the supernatant with the cells already transferred into the new vessel.</li>
<li>Gently resuspend cells by pipetting up and down several times and adjust concentration at 1 × 106 cells/mL in warm TCM supplemented with IL-2 to achieve a final concentration of 50–100 IU IL-2/mL.</li>
<li>Aliquot 1–2 × 105 cells from both CAR transduced and UTD vessels into 5 mL round-bottom flow cytometry tubes. Collect cells in the tube bottom by spinning down at 500 <b>×</b> <i>g</i> for 5 min. Decant supernatants and treat cells with 10 μL of canine gamma-globulins for 10 min at 20°C–25°C. This will help reduce non-specific binding of mAb.</li>
<li>Proceed with CAR labeling as required (see representative CAR labeling procedure for our anti-canine CD20 CAR in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). Additional mAb can be included, such as anti-canine CD3, CD5, CD4 and CD8a mAb, to characterize canine T cell phenotype, or to detect marker genes co-expressed with the CAR.

<h3 id="sec3.7">Ancillary considerations for the use of canine CAR T cells in pet dogs: Dose and QC tests</h3>
<p>The use of autologous, genetically re-directed T cells has shown unprecedented success in the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, further implementation is needed to improve their efficacy particularly in solid cancers. Pet dogs share a close phylogenetic relationship with man and spontaneously develop tumors with similar clinical, immunological, biological, and genetic features as their human counterparts. Dogs and humans share the same environment that may influence tumor development and progression. Further, the size, longevity and physiology of the canine immune system resemble those of man. Lastly, comparable barriers to effective immunotherapy exist between dogs and humans. As many canine cancer patients are treated with the same therapies as humans, <i>dogs are being increasingly recognized as a much needed, clinically relevant, parallel patient population in which to evaluate next generation cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies and to identify correlative biomarkers of response.</i></p>
<p>The Beau Biden National Cancer Moonshot Initiative provides funding mechanisms to support a network for canine cancer immunotherapy clinical trials (PRECINCT) aimed at catalyzing research productivity within a collaborative network and accelerating human translation through comparative oncology (<a href="http://www.precinctnetwork.org">www.precinctnetwork.org</a>). This, together with a standardized protocol for efficient transduction and expansion of canine CAR T cell, can greatly facilitate the use of the dog “model” by human and comparative oncology researchers, and promote the performance of multicenter clinical trials, with data harmonization across institutions.</p>
<p>The protocol described here enables effective engineering of primary canine T cells and their expansion up to clinical scale (see expected results). Our recommended target cell dose for infusion in canine patients is 0.2 to 5.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR positive T cells/kg body weight. In addition, a series of quality control (QC) tests are recommended on end-of-expansion CAR T cell products. <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a> summarizes a list of potential QC tests.</p>

<p>We observed a greater proliferation when culturing canine T cells that were subjected to freezing at 38.8°C (range 38.3°C–39.2°C), which is the canine physiological body temperature (24-fold change at 38.8°C vs 11-fold change at 37°C over 5 days, n=7, P=0.0156, <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A). This is consistent with observations reported by others in T cells that were cryopreserved (<a href="#bib9">Szopa et al., 2021</a>).

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Our protocol enables transduction of primary canine T cells isolated from healthy donor as well as canine cancer patients. However, transduction efficiencies and T cell expansion may vary among donors. This has been also described for primary human T cells and has been attributed to inter- and intra-donor T cells functional heterogeneity, i.e., (1) different expression of receptors that determine susceptibility to virus infection and (2) different proliferative potential in distinct T cell subsets, which may also exhibit variable frequency across individuals (<a href="#bib3">Milone and O’Doherty 2018</a>; <a href="#bib5">Noaks et al., 2021</a>). Furthermore, transduction efficiencies and T cell expansion may be lower in patient derived T cells as active disease and/or recent/multiple lines of chemotherapy may affect their proliferative capacity (<a href="#bib1">Fraietta et al., 2018</a>), a key determinant of successful infection by retroviruses.</p>
<p>The viral production workflow described in this protocol has been optimized for manufacturing of anti-CD20 CAR retrovirus using MSGV1 transfer vector in combination with our Gag/Pol and RD114 plasmids. Different plasmids may require some optimization to achieve similar TE.</p>
<p>While primary canine T cells grow best at 38.8°C, not all research environments may have the opportunity to dedicate an incubator to canine cell culture. Primary canine T cells can be cultured at 37°C, although their infectability and proliferation are reduced.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Retroviral titers are low (step 6f).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution 1</h3>
<p>Poor HEK 293T health/maintenance and plasmid quality might be the cause. Healthy HEK 293T cells are the first determinant of successful and efficient virus production. Cells should be passaged when they are 70–80% confluent and split down to 10–15%, e.g., 1:6 - 1:8. Using this approach, cells require regular passaging every other day or every 2 days. Overgrowth prior to passaging can compromise their subsequent transfection efficiency. In this case, consider discarding and thawing a fresh vial.</p>
<p>Further tips that may help improve titers include using low-passage HEK 293T (e.g., subcultured &lt;25 times from the first use, including previous freeze-thaw cycles), passaging HEK 293T 3 times after thawing before transfection and handling ≤ 3 dishes at a time, as HEK293T are particularly sensitive to the levels of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and pH changes. Last, check that plasmid preparations are endotoxin-free, and DNA is mostly supercoiled. Of note, low titers based on infection of K562 cells with RD114 pseudotyped viral supernatants may still enable effective transduction of activated canine T cells upon concentration on RetroNectin. The virus binding step 28f-g can be repeated if titers are very low and higher volumes of supernatant are required.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Activation of fresh cells with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads is poor (step 27).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution 2</h3>
<p>The activating beads might be insufficient or nonfunctional. Check the concentration of the beads in the plate and in the vial to exclude that the bead-to-cell ratio is lower than 3-to-1 and that the original concentration is lower than 4 <b>×</b>10<sup>7</sup>/mL. Inaccurate handling, such as poor resuspension before removing a bead aliquot from the vial, may alter the bead concentration. Nonfunctional beads may be due to poor manufacturing and/or storage. Confirm that the amounts of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 used at the time of coating was correct. Buffers should always be fresh, as lower pH and/or poor BSA blocking may also reduce the efficiency of the coating. A trial test could be performed using increasing bead-to-cell ratios. If higher bead numbers do not lead to greater T cell activation and higher T cell counts, the beads might be nonfunctional, and a new batch should be manufactured.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Activation of cryopreserved cells with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads is poor (step 27).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution 3</h3>
<p>It is vital to cryopreserve and thaw cells correctly to preserve the viability. A higher seeding density, i.e., 4–5 <b>×</b>10<sup>6</sup> cells / mL and a few hours rest (4–12h) in the presence of cytokines and without beads, may help cells recover faster and more completely. As cells may continue to die during the first hours after thawing and a variable number of cells may also be lost after washing, it is important to confirm cell number by counting immediately after thawing and before addition of the beads.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>T cells are well activated, and virus titers are adequate, but T cell transduction efficiency is low (step 37).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution 4</h3>
<p>Check the RetroNectin coating and virus binding steps. The ability of RetroNectin to concentrate virus may be affected by incorrect handling, e.g., filtering before use, too low dilutions (up to 1-in-10 can be used) or excess of freeze-thaw cycles. Further, different subjects exhibit different proliferative potential and/or susceptibility to infection, which leads to heterogeneous transduction efficiencies across individuals. Where possible, small-scale trial infections using different amounts of virus (e.g., 0.125 mL, 0.25 mL, 0.5 mL and 1 mL virus supernatant) may help choose the best volume of virus/MOIs for a specific T cell preparation.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>UTD cells expand more than CAR T cells (step 39).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution 5</h3>
<p>This could be relevant particularly in the case of low transduction efficiencies and could be minimized by reducing the quantity of cytokines and rapidly weaning them. If necessary, CAR T cells can be purified by FACS or MACS. For example, CAR T cells could be labeled as described in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> using Biotinylated anti-CAR antibody, followed by immune magnetic selection using Anti-Biotin MicroBeads as per manufacturer’s recommendations (Anti-Biotin MicroBeads). Alternatively, in the case of co-expressed marker genes, a biotinylated antibody specifically recognizing the marker gene could be used.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Functionality of cryopreserved CAR T cells is poor (step 41).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution 6</h3>
<p>Cryopreservation and thawing techniques are critical to preserve canine CAR T viability and function. It may be beneficial to plate the cells at higher density than usually recommended for fresh cells (4–5 <b>×</b> 10<sup>6</sup> vs 1–2 <b>×</b> 10<sup>6</sup>). Similarly, extra supplementation of IL-15 (10–30 ng/mL) could be employed to exploit the well-established, growth factor-like properties of IL-15.</p>
