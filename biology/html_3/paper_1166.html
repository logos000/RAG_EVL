<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The microbes indigenous to helminth species are a major obstacle to deciphering host-parasite interactions. Repurposing a system of reversible bacterial colonization, we have generated germ-free <i>Heligomosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hpb</i>) larvae that maintain the sterility of axenic mice upon infection. This protocol provides a valuable tool for controlled studies of helminth-microbiota-immune interactions.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The natural murine parasitic roundworm <i>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</i> (<i>Hpb</i>) is a widely used model of chronic helminth infection (<a href="#bib8">Reynolds et al., 2012</a>). Although it has been shown that helminths can profoundly alter gut commensal composition and function (<a href="#bib6">Rapin et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib10">Walk et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib11">Zaiss et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib5">Ramanan et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib7">Rausch et al., 2018</a>), controlled germ-free and gnotobiotic studies of enteric <i>Hpb</i> infection are limited by the presence of the parasite’s own indigenous microbiota. These parasite-associated microbes create a unique dilemma as a confounding source of contamination, yet are indispensable for certain parasitic developmental stages. Indeed, progression from egg to infective <i>Hpb</i> (L3) larvae requires microbe-rich feces for development, and fecal cultures are the primary method used for generating L3 larvae in a laboratory setting (<a href="#bib2">Johnston et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p>A recent study examining helminth-microbiota interactions reported a method for growing bacteriologically sterile <i>Hpb</i> larvae (<a href="#bib11">Zaiss et al., 2015</a>). However, neither details regarding the fitness or immunogenicity of these larvae nor ability of such larvae to maintain the microbe-free status of germ-free mice was provided. Here we provide a detailed description of a methodology adapted from this original report for the growth of gnotobiotic <i>Hpb</i> larvae suitable for the infection of germ-free mice. To this end, a genetically-modified strain of auxotrophic <i>E. coli</i> (strain HA107) was repurposed to facilitate the growth of axenic <i>Hpb</i> larvae. Originally engineered to reversibly colonize germ-free mice (<a href="#bib1">Hapfelmeier et al., 2010</a>), HA107 requires exogenous D-Alanine (D-Ala) and 2,6-Diaminopimelic acid (m-DAP) to grow. Since these metabolites are not produced by germ-free mice, this auxotroph is unable to contaminate or persist in these hosts. Here, after isolation and antibiotic-treatment of <i>Hpb</i> eggs to ensure no contaminant microbes are present, <i>E. coli</i> HA107 is supplied as the sole food source for developing <i>Hpb</i> larvae, resulting in the development of gnotobiotic L3 larvae that do not contaminate germ-free hosts upon infection.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">
<i>Hpb</i> infection to obtain egg-producing adult worms</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 7–12 weeks</div>
<p>In preparation for this protocol, regular (fecal-grown) <i>Hpb</i> larvae should be generated and used to infect specific pathogen-free (SPF) wild-type C57BL/6 mice. These infected SPF mice are used as a source of adult <i>Hpb</i> worms which will lay the eggs from which gnotobiotic <i>Hpb</i> can be grown. All animal studies were performed using protocols approved by the McGill University Health Centre – Research Institute Animal Resource Division.</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate infective L3 stage <i>Hpb</i> larvae by standard fecal-culture methods.
<ol type="a">
<li>Collect fecal pellets from C57BL/6J mice infected for 4–12 weeks with 250 L3 <i>Hpb</i> larvae. Between 20 and 40 fecal pellets is recommended; higher quantity will yield more larvae.</li>
<li>Under a biological safety cabinet, spray the pellets with room temperature (20°C–25°C) sterile water.</li>
<li>Place 2 Whatman filters into a sterile 150 × 15mm Petri dish and wet them with room temperature (20°C–25°C) sterile water.</li>
<li>Using a 1 mL syringe plunger, mash the fecal pellets into a paste, and spread onto the center of the top piece of filter paper. Keep the feces moist, adding more sterile water if necessary.</li>
<li>Close the lid of the 150 × 15 mm Petri dish and place in a box (Styrofoam or other). On top of the fecal-culture dish, place another 150 × 15 mm Petri dish. Fill this dish with sterile water and leave with no cover.</li>
<li>Close the box and leave the fecal cultures for 10–14 days.</li>
<li>To collect L3 larvae after 10–14 days, decant any liquid contents of the fecal culture-containing Petri dish into a 50 mL tube.</li>
<li>Grab the top filter paper and spray the underside with sterile water to wash off L3 larvae down into the dish. Perform this step with the underside of the second piece of filter paper. Transfer the contents washed off into the 50 mL tube.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the tube at 300<i>g</i> for 3 min at 4°C, then remove supernatant until 5 mL remains.</li>
<li>Count the number of viable L3 <i>Hpb</i> larvae simply by pipetting 3–5 aliquots onto a slide and observing under a brightfield microscope.</li>
<li>Store fecal-grown <i>Hpb</i> larvae in water for up to 6 months at 4°C.</li>
<li>Using <i>Hpb</i> larvae generated by fecal-culture method, infect 1–5 C57BL/6J wild-type mice bred under SPF conditions by gavage with 400 L3. These mice will be used as a source of adult <i>Hpb</i> worms from which pure eggs (used to generate gnotobiotic larvae) are collected.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> For step 1l, do not infect mice more than 4 weeks in advance of the expected start date for gnotobiotic <i>Hpb</i> growth, as older worms will impact egg output and eventual larval fitness.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This protocol was developed using 4get.KN2 mice bred on a C57BL/6J background (<a href="#bib4">Mohrs et al., 2005</a>). Since these mice simply serve as a stock of adult <i>Hpb</i> worms, alternative genotypes can be used. However, it should be ensured the genotype used does not impair <i>Hpb</i> fitness (MyD88−/− mice, for example, display accelerated <i>Hpb</i> expulsion and are an example of a genotype that should be avoided) (<a href="#bib9">Reynolds et al., 2014</a>).</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of liquid and agar media</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4 hours</div>
<p>Various media preparations (both liquid and agar) should be prepared in advance – these will be used to 1) test for contamination throughout the protocol, 2) grow <i>E. coli</i> HA107, and 3) serve as a platform on which to grow gnotobiotic larvae.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Prepare 250 mL of Luria broth (LB) media (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</a>).</li>
<li>Prepare 250 mL of supplemented Luria broth (LB Supp) media (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</a>).</li>
<li>Prepare LB, LB Supp, Yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD), and Nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</a>). Typically, no more than 5 plates of each variety are used each time the protocol is executed. These plates can be made in bulk and stored at 4°C, however, so recipes are described at higher quantities.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Streaking single <i>E.coli</i> HA107 colonies</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> overnight</div>
<p><b>Caution:</b> <i>E. coli</i> HA107 derives from strain K-12, and as such is a biosafety level 1 pathogen suitable for bench-side use. Use appropriate personal protective equipment while handling. For the purposes of this protocol, handling of the bacteria is best done under a biological safety cabinet to ensure sterility.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>From a glycerol stock, streak <i>E. coli</i> HA107 onto an LB Supp agar plate and incubate at 37°C overnight.</li>
<li>Streak <i>E. coli</i> HA107 onto a regular LB plate as a negative control and incubate at 37°C overnight.</li>
<li>After overnight growth at 37°C, colony-containing plates can be kept parafilm-wrapped for 4 weeks at 4°C.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Re-streak <i>E. coli</i> HA107 if colony plates surpass 4 weeks old.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Over 4–5 days of culturing on NGM media, <i>Hpb</i> eggs will hatch and grow into the infective L3 stage of larvae (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a> and <a href="#fig5">5</a>A). These larvae are void of contaminant bacteria, as aerobic culture of a typical infectious dose (200 L3) on LB or YPD media results in a complete lack of microbial growth, in stark contrast to <i>Hpb</i> reared by regular fecal-culture methods (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B). Despite being grown under controlled conditions with a restricted food source solely of <i>E. coli</i> HA107, these gnotobiotic larvae are viable and infective. Indeed, when compared to regular fecal-grown larvae, HA107-grown <i>Hpb</i> display similar infection rates and fecundity (a readout of fitness) when infecting wild-type mice housed under SPF conditions (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>A and 6B).</p>

<p><i>Hpb</i> is often used as a model to study the immune response to chronic helminth infection (<a href="#bib8">Reynolds et al., 2012</a>). The anti-<i>Hpb</i> cellular immune response features a robust expansion of CD4+ T cells, including T follicular helper (Tfh) and Th2 cells (<a href="#bib3">King and Mohrs, 2009</a>). Despite being grown under highly controlled conditions, the gnotobiotic <i>Hpb</i> larvae reared using this protocol display comparable induction of Tfh and Th2 cells in the draining mesenteric lymph nodes during infection, relative to fecal-grown <i>Hpb</i> larvae, bolstering the validity of this model for immunological studies. Indeed, infection of IL-4 dual reporter ‘4get/KN2’ mice, wherein GFP expression marks cells expressing <i>I</i><i>l4</i> mRNA and surface huCD2 expression marks IL-4 protein secreting Tfh cells revealed HA107 and fecal-grown <i>Hpb</i> larvae to induce comparable levels of IL-4 competent and producing CD4+ T cells during infection (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>C–6E) (<a href="#bib4">Mohrs et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, the humoral component of the anti-<i>Hpb</i> immune response, dominated by the induction of class-switched IgE and IgG1 antibodies, was similar following fecal-grown and germ-free <i>Hpb</i> larvae (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>F and 6G).</p>
<p>Finally, the gnotobiotic <i>Hpb</i> larvae grown using this protocol are void of contaminant bacteria and maintain the bacteriologically sterile status of germ-free mice upon infection, as determined by multiple readouts. First, germ-free mice infected with the gnotobiotic <i>Hpb</i> larvae generated by this protocol retained significantly larger ceca relative to germ-free mice challenged with conventionally-reared parasites (<a href="#fig7">Figures 7</a>A and 7B). Second, fecal samples from all germ-free mice challenged with <i>Hpb</i> HA107 were negative for bacterial contamination, at two weeks post-infection, by culture in brain heart infusion broth (BHI) for seven days in three conditions (37°C and 25°C aerobic, and 30°C anaerobic). Third, 16S DNA quantification by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmed no appreciable increase in bacterial load in the feces of germ-free mice challenged with HA107-grown <i>Hpb</i>, in contrast to the over 100-fold increase in 16S rDNA load observed in germ-free mice infected with fecal-grown larvae (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>C). Finally, compared to mice infected with fecal-grown <i>Hpb</i>, SYTOX green staining of cecal contents from mice infected with HA107-grown larvae revealed no detectable live bacteria (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>D). Importantly, gnotobiotic <i>Hpb</i> larvae were able to establish within germ-free mice (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>E), indicating the potential for <i>ex vivo</i> experiments using germ-free adult <i>Hpb</i> worms.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Regardless of the culture method, some <i>Hpb</i> eggs will not reach L3 stage and will be unavoidably harvested alongside the viable L3 stage larvae. It is possible that dead eggs impact the course of infection. Nevertheless, L3 <i>Hpb</i> larvae efficiently parasitize the murine host. Since we validate that HA107-grown <i>Hpb</i> display similar infectivity, fecundity, and immunogenicity to fecal-grown larvae even in an SPF host, a single batch of germ-free larvae can be used for all infection conditions to properly control for this aspect of the protocol.</p>
<p>While HA107-reared <i>Hpb</i> do not contain viable bacteria or fungi, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that dead bacteria or bacteria-derived products (e.g., LPS) remaining on or in <i>Hpb</i> larvae may impact the course of and/or immune response to infection. Additional washes of the final <i>Hpb</i> larvae preparation prior to infection is advised to minimize this confounding factor. The inclusion of germ-free mice gavaged with the final media preparation without the presence of live larvae could be considered as an additional control group.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Lack of <i>E. coli</i> HA107 overnight growth in LB Supp Media (step 6a).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If <i>E. coli</i> HA107 does not grow in LB Supp Media, ensure that the colonies being picked for overnight culture growth are not too old - streak fresh colonies the day before commencing the protocol. Ensure precise and equal splitting of the chosen bacterial colony between flasks. Prepare fresh liquid media (verifying the composition) and make fresh preparations of m-DAP and D-Ala metabolites. Dissolving the m-DAP as indicated is a critical step - replacing the 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the total volume that is HCl with water will compromise bacterial growth in the eventual media. Only add filter-sterilized m-DAP and D-Ala (as well as HA107 inoculate) after the base LB media has been autoclaved and cooled to room temperature (20°C–25°C).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Contamination of overnight culture negative controls (e.g., growth in un-supplemented LB Media – step 6a).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Streak a fresh agar plate of HA107 colonies. Streak some HA107 glycerol stock onto an un-supplemented LB agar plate as a negative control, to ensure the stock itself does not contain non-HA107 microbes. Ensure HA107 inoculation is done carefully. If using pipette tips, ensure they are autoclaved and only handle them with autoclaved forceps if inoculating the entire pipette tip along with the scraped bacteria. Perform all steps handling bacteria in a biological safety cabinet (not on the bench with a Bunsen burner).</p>

<p>Ensure that adult worm extraction is done using autoclaved forceps and that the antibiotic cocktails are filter-sterilized – these mixtures, while extensive, account for microbes in an SPF mouse gut, but not all possible environmental contaminants. Ensure antibiotic concentrations are appropriate and prepare fresh antibiotic stock solutions as freeze-thaw cycles may degrade these reagents. Finally, even in the absence of a visible bacterial or fungal bloom, consider shortening the incubation period of adult worms to lay eggs and ensure the eggs are incubated in antibiotics at 4°C for a full 24 h.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Contamination of L3 <i>Hpb</i> larvae (as assessed by plating on YPD and LB agar – step 8e).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Assess controls to help determine at what point in the protocol contamination took place. See previous potential solutions if contamination occurred during the growth of the pure <i>E. coli</i> HA107 monoculture, or if antibiotic-treatment incompletely sterilized the <i>Hpb</i> eggs. If these controls were clear, ensure the handling of the eggs and bacteria when preparing the NGM plates is done carefully. Perform all steps in a sterilized biological safety cabinet. Wipe down all pipettes with 70% ethanol and use filtered tips to combat contaminating aerosols from the pipette interior. Ensure the plastic bags being used to store the NGM plates are completely sterile and that the interior remains clean during handling.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Low L3 <i>Hpb</i> viability or infectivity (step 8d and beyond).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure that HA107-grown <i>Hpb</i> larvae are used within a week of harvest to maximize infectivity. When using larvae for infection, it is essential to keep them on ice. Similarly, harvest the larvae with cold (4°C) sterile water and keep them on ice as you harvest them from the NGM plates. If performing additional washes of the HA107-grown <i>Hpb</i> upon harvest, ensure additional centrifugation steps do not impact larval viability (as judged by motility observed under a brightfield microscope). Similarly, ensure all centrifugation steps throughout the protocol are performed at the appropriate speed, as excessive <i>g</i>’s may affect egg or larval viability. Make sure that the adult <i>Hpb</i> worms extracted to lay eggs are not too old – this is essential as using eggs from older worms (&gt;4 weeks) has been found to lower the infectivity and fitness of HA107-grown larvae.</p>
