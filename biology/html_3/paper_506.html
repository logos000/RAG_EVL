<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The maintenance of stem cell populations and the differentiation of their progeny is coordinated by specific communication with associated niche cells. Here, we describe a protocol for short-term live imaging of the <i>Drosophila</i> ovarian germline stem cell niche <i>ex vivo.</i> By immobilizing the ovarian tissue in a fibrinogen-thrombin clot, we are able to maintain the tissue for short-term high-temporal live imaging. This enables the visualization of dynamic cellular processes, such as the cytoskeletal dynamics that control stem cell niche communication.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib11">Wilcockson and Ashe (2019)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Experimental design consideration</h3>
<p>The <i>Drosophila</i> ovarian germline provides a well-studied model of stem cell biology and the mechanisms that regulate their self-renewal and differentiation; from stem cell niche communication and post-transcriptional regulation to systemic signaling and aging. While the majority of this work to date has relied on “snap-shot” views of GSC biology, live imaging of the ovary is now revealing the cell biology that contributes to GSC self-renewal (<a href="#bib11">Wilcockson and Ashe, 2019</a>) and daughter cell differentiation (<a href="#bib2">Chanet and Huynh, 2020</a>).</p>
<p><i>Drosophila</i> has represented a premier model for investigating developmental cell biology <i>in vivo</i> for decades and this has resulted in the generation of a multitude of fluorescent reporters, particularly based on the Gal4-UAS system (<a href="#bib1">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</a>). Many of these constructs rely on a UASt promoter which drives transgene expression in somatic tissues (including that of the ovary), however, this promoter drives very poor expression in the germline. This was subsequently altered by the addition of a transposase promoter element expressed in the female germline to create UASp (<a href="#bib9">Rorth, 1998</a>). This created a promoter that drives high expression in the germline but not in somatic tissues. Most recently, <a href="#bib3">DeLuca and Spradling (2018)</a> resolved this final issue with the creation of UASz which drives higher expression than UASp in the germline and equally high expression as UASt in somatic tissue. Unfortunately, this has yet to be adopted by the community as a default promoter, therefore promoter choice will need to be considered when choosing established reporters and when creating new lines.</p>
<p>A second consideration, that is important for any experiment, is the choice of reporter used. Different methods of labeling cellular compartments and structures can have deleterious effects. For example, different actin labels expressed in developing egg chambers were found to cause aberrant actin dynamics (<a href="#bib10">Spracklen, et al., 2014</a>). While this is partly explained by the affinity of different reporters to actin, the reporter was also sensitive to temperature and the strength of the Gal4 driver used. It is therefore important to empirically test new reporters, for example, by testing fertility rates in transgenic lines.</p>
<p>A final consideration when studying GSC biology, is to keep in mind their regulation at the systemic level. Reproductive organs are plastic and respond to many signals, including nutrition, and hormonal cues associated with mating and aging (<a href="#bib4">Drummond-Barbosa, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib6">Ishibashi et al. 2020</a>). It is therefore important to finely control aspects of the flies’ lives that could introduce noise, for example, maintaining experimental females with small numbers of wildtype males (see below) to promote reproduction but prohibit overcrowding (<a href="#bib7">Joshi et al., 1998</a>).</p>

<p>The protocol here describes the experimental setup used to image GFP-Tubulin in the germline but can be applied to other transgenic fly lines as discussed in Expected Outcomes. All <i>Drosophila</i> lines are kept at 18°C for long-term maintenance and are kept at 25°C when crossing two lines together. Flies are raised on standard fly food (<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>).</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Mounting ovaries in a fibrinogen-thrombin clot greatly reduces tissue movement to enable higher temporal resolution when imaging dynamic processes. In <a href="#bib11">Wilcockson and Ashe (2019)</a>, we utilized this method to specifically investigate the interaction between GSCs and their associated niche cells, the cap cells (CpCs). We found that GSCs extend microtubule-rich cytocensor projections in between the CpCs (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A) while the GSCs and their differentiating daughters extend many dynamic actin-rich cytoskeletal projections (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B). The temporal resolution achieved enabled a comparison of germ cell actin filopodia dynamics (<a href="#fig3">Figures 3</a>C and 3D).</p>

<p>This technique could also be extended to monitoring other dynamic cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression in the proliferative somatic cells of the ovary (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A) and the slowly dividing germline (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B). We have also noted distinct actin dynamics in the later stage germline cysts, where waves of cortical F-actin are associated with cortical blebbing (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>C). A recent study, using ovarioles immobilized in hydrogel, showed that these contractile actomyosin waves play a role in germline cyst encapsulation which is necessary for egg chamber development (<a href="#bib2">Chanet and Huynh, 2020</a>). Therefore, the method of ovariole immobilization in a fibrinogen-thrombin clot can be adapted to investigate the cell biology regulating the later germline and soma of the ovary.</p>

<p>We believe that the fibrinogen-thrombin clot method provides several advantages over other live imaging techniques. In particular, the technical simplicity of tissue mounting and immobilization, and the low cost of reagents make this method very accessible. This method also achieves an enhanced degree of immobilization in comparison with low-melt agarose which, in our hands, is insufficient to completely immobilize the very minute tissues of the ovary. The permeability of the clot also lends this technique well to pharmacological manipulation (<a href="#bib5">Hannaford et al., 2019</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>While the method outlined here has been used for short-term imaging (2–3 h) of the germline, it has not been tested for long-term (≥6 h) <i>ex vivo</i> culture of the ovary. It has been noted in one study of <i>ex vivo</i> live imaging of the germarium encased in Matrigel, that removal of the muscle sheath is associated with reduced rates of egg chamber budding from the posterior of the germarium (<a href="#bib8">Reilein et al., 2018</a>). While we have not found this to be a problem, this could be remedied by mounting the ovarioles in their muscle sheath. The movement will be reduced by encasing the ovarioles in the fibrinogen-thrombin clot but it cannot be blocked completely and the contractions of the muscle will disrupt imaging.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The fibrinogen-thrombin clot sticks to the pipette tip and pulls away from the glass coverslip.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The fibrinogen-thrombin clot starts to form immediately upon mixing the two solutions together. Therefore, to avoid the clot attaching to the pipette tip, expel the thrombin droplet from the pipette tip and allow it to contact the fSIM. As soon as the droplet of thrombin mixes with the fSIM, rapidly remove the pipette tip to stop it contacting the fSIM. Do not mix the solutions by pipetting.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The fibrinogen-thrombin clot lifts away from the coverslip when adding media or does not form at all.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This could be due to issues with the mounting. One possibility is that the fibrinogen concentration is too low or the fibrinogen has precipitated out of solution. This results in weaker clot formation that is easily disturbed. If this occurs remake the fSIM and ensure that all the fibrinogen has dissolved. Fibrinogen is not soluble in water so should either be dissolved in 1% saline solution or directly in SIM at 37°C with gentle agitation. Do not vortex.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the clot has not been given enough time to form. Although the clot forms immediately upon mixing of fibrinogen and thrombin, in our hands we find that it has to be left for 10–15 min so that it remains firmly attached to the coverslip. It is also helpful to add the thrombin dropwise at 2–3 different points around the germaria if they are widely spread. The clot will only form so far and by adding another drop of thrombin, the area of the clot will be extended.</p>
<p>Finally, if the clot does not form at all then there is likely an issue with one or more of the reagents. For example, the fibrinogen has precipitated out of solution. If this problem persists then remake all of the solutions.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Photobleaching occurs during live imaging.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Microscope settings will need to be optimized for each fluorescent reporter. To address this, decrease the laser power and/or reduce the sampling frequency.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>During live imaging, the germaria move out of focus.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This could be an issue with the dissection of the ovarioles. If any muscle remains attached to any of tissue on the coverslip it can cause movement throughout the clot during contractions. It is therefore essential to try and remove as much of the muscle overlying the ovaries as is possible.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the clot has become detached from the coverslip, leading to the gradual drifting of the germaria away from the field of view. To address this, see <a href="#sec5.3">Troubleshooting 2</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The niche cells cannot be located.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is made easier by using markers for the somatic cells of the germarium, although there are no CpC-specific markers currently available to the best of our knowledge. There are, however, more general germarial somatic cell markers (e.g., <i>bab1-Gal4</i> labels all anterior somatic cells of the germarium, including CpCs, and <i>c587-Gal4</i> labels escort cells and follicle cells.) However, the use of these transgenic lines alongside germline-driver lines is not possible. Alternatively, the niche CpCs can be easily identified with a H2B-labeled transgene (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>A) by their compact nuclei, pseudostratified arrangement, and their juxtaposition to the GSCs, which have much larger diffuse nuclei.</p>
<p>A general issue that arises is that the niche is not oriented exactly orthogonal to the coverslip/the germarium lengthways. This is because it can protrude away from the terminal filament cells resulting in the niche and the GSCs being oriented at an angle, with respect to the coverslip/the length of the germarium. Depending on how the tissue has oriented during the mounting stage, this may make it difficult to image both the GSCs and the niche cells, in which case, it is better to search for another ovariole on the dish to image.</p>
