<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Current protocols for storage of white blood cells (WBCs) rely on constant refrigeration. The protocol described below explains the preparation of a fixative combination saline (FCS) formulation, which allows fixation of human WBCs and lysis of red blood cells and platelets (at ambient temperature, 4–35<sup>o</sup>C) in whole blood samples in one step. FCS can be used for storing and transporting blood at ambient temperatures for up to 4 months, without altering the nuclear morphology and genomic integrity of WBCs.</p>




<div class="highlights">

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<ol>
<li>Approval of institutional ethical committee must be obtained, and experiments must be executed as per the approved ethical guidelines.</li>
<li>The FCS-containing vials must be prepared, before the experiments are planned to be executed, by following the method detailed below. If Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) is being prepared in the laboratory from its constituents, it must be autoclaved. In this case the preparation time may slightly increase (1–2 h).</li>
<li>A phlebotomist with a syringe or a lancet should be ready to withdraw the blood sample either by puncturing the cubital vein or by pricking the finger.</li>
<li>Volunteers must be ready to donate the blood; consent must be obtained as per ethical guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Since this protocol deals with handling of human blood samples, it is mandatory to wear gloves and a face mask to avoid the possibility of any kind of bacterial/viral/fungal infections.</div>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Store stock FCS solution in an airtight glass bottle; working FCS can be stored in polypropylene tubes too.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We observed little change in the pH of blank FCS in the storage duration of 4 months at refrigerated or ambient temperature (4°C–35°C) and no difference was observed in its fixation attributes. Significant change in pH can be considered as an indicator of expiration of blank FCS. Long and/or leaky storage may lead to increase in the pH of FCS, owing to evaporation of glacial acetic acid, resulting in a change in the actual composition or proportion of the constituents. The acceptable bounds of pH for this protocol are 2.3–3.1. If pH goes below the lower threshold (i.e., 2.3) it starts destabilizing the nuclear membrane of WBCs and if pH goes above the upper threshold (i.e., 3.1) it starts accumulation of degraded membrane debris of RBCs and platelets, which is challenging to remove from the pellet, thus resulting in recovery of WBCs with impurities.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If all the constituents are added/mixed properly, in the proportions as described above, pH of the working FCS will be in the range of 2.3–3.1 (even after incubation up to 4 months). If pH is falling below and or above the lower and or upper threshold levels, it is recommended to discard this working FCS solution and prepare a fresh FCS working solution from the stock. It is not recommended to adjust the pH of working FCS solution by adding any acid or alkali.</div>

<p>Morphological examinations of the recovered leukocytes from various time points were made by fluorescence microscopy. It was observed that, shape, size, morphology, and integrity of nuclei (of all kinds of leukocytes) were intact/unchanged (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Neutrophils can be identified with their characteristic 3–5 lobed nucleus, joined by slender strands of genetic material (<a href="#bib3">Chan et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib9">Nothan, 2006</a>). Lymphocytes and monocytes can be identified by their characteristic round (uniform) and indented (kidney shaped) nuclei, respectively (<a href="#bib7">Jacob, 2016</a>; <a href="#bib11">Sarrafzadeh et al., 2014</a>). It is evident from the field view (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>), neutrophils were the most abundant followed by lymphocytes, and other cells (monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) were least in counts. It was observed that, integrity of the cytoplasm was not maintained/preserved in the tested proportion of blood and FCS, described above.</p>

<h3 id="sec4.2">Long-term preservation of chromatin regions in fixed leukocytes, demonstrated by G0-FISH</h3>
<p>To demonstrate intactness of the chromatin regions, in fixed leukocytes, G0-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed, with centromeric probes (Metasystems, Altlussheim, Germany), following the manufacturer’s guideline with slight modifications (<a href="#bib8">Ly et al., 2017</a>). As, illustrated in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>, centromeric regions of chromosome pair 1, were intact in their territories. Similar observations were found with centromeric probes of chromosome Y (figure not shown here). These results indicate that, chromatin regions were intact in their territories, in fixed leukocytes, which can be explored for detection of any locus specific changes in the chromatin for various clinical and other applications.</p>

<h3 id="sec4.3">Long-term preservation of radiation-induced chromosomal translocations, fragmentation, and apoptosis in fixed leukocytes</h3>
<p>To evaluate fixation abilities of FCS for radiation induced changes in the chromatin, blood samples were irradiated with 2 Gy of <sup>60</sup>Co-γ-rays in Blood Irradiator-2000 (manufactured and supplied by Board of Radiation &amp; Isotope Technology (BRIT), DAE, India) and incubated (in optimum conditions) for 4 h, before fixation, to allow DNA repair to occur. G0-FISH was performed for chromosome pair 1 (with whole chromosome paint probe, from Metasystems, Altlussheim, Germany) following manufacturer’s guideline with slight modifications (<a href="#bib1">Barquinero et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib2">Chaurasia et al., 2021</a>). As illustrated in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>B, chromatin fragments and or translocations were found preserved/intact in the fixed leukocytes. Apoptotic cells i.e., cells with nuclear and chromosomal fragmentations and blebbings (<a href="#bib6">He et al., 2009</a>) were distinguishable/identifiable (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>C) in fixed leukocytes. No unexpected changes in the irradiated or control (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>A) leukocytes were observed due to the process of fixation. Apoptosis and chromosomal fragmentation/translocation, are established marker of, not only radiation exposure but many other physical, chemical and biological stresses to the cell (<a href="#bib5">Grégoire et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib10">Payne et al., 1992</a>), which opens up a wide window for the practical application/utility of FCS.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Although nuclear morphology and integrity are maintained well even after 4 months of incubation at ambient temperature after fixation in all the leukocytes, G0-FISH results had shown little flary edges of the hybridized regions of the chromatin after around 3 months of fixation and storage at ambient temperature. However, this can easily be rectified during imaging by adjusting the parameters of gain and the lower and upper thresholds in the software.</p>
<p>Preservation of proteomic antigens/markers such as γH2AX, 53BP1 and ATM, in the fixed WBCs, were tested, by immunofluorescence assays with fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. It was observed that these antigens/markers were not preserved in the fixed WBCs, recovered at all incubation time points, mentioned above.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>What should be done if the pellet of RBCs and platelets is not getting dissolved after 2–3 washings (step 7, in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a>) with stock FCS solution (Mixture 1).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The number of washings can be increased to 3–5 (no changes were observed in the nuclear morphology and genomic integrity of preserved WBCs up to 5 washes), to dissolve most of the debris of RBCs and platelets. If contamination of debris persists, a small increase in the proportion of glacial acetic acid in FCS recovery cocktail will resolve the issue; 10–30 μL of glacial acetic acid can be increased in 10 mL of FCS stock solution (Mixture 1), step by step increase of 10 μL, at the max 30 μL (in 3 steps). Time of treatment was kept same, as described earlier. No change in the nuclear morphology and genomic integrity of WBCs, were observed up to 30 μL extra added glacial acetic acid, per 10 mL of FCS stock solution (Mixture 1).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Increase in the proportion of glacial acetic acid can also affect the integrity of the membrane of WBCs, therefore it is recommended to increase it gradually in a well-controlled manner, as described above.</div>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>What should be done if integrity of the membrane is not well preserved after fixation (<a href="#expected-outcomes">expected outcomes</a> section).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A little gradual decrease (10–30 μL of glacial acetic acid can be decreased/reduced, per 10 mL of FCS stock solution i.e., Mixture 1) in the proportion of acetic acid can be tried, as acetic acid is responsible for membrane destabilization.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> FCS can be used for the preservation of various other kinds of cell lines too. However, the proportion of glacial acetic acid may have to be slightly increased or decreased, depending on the cell line, as the composition of membrane varies with the nature of cell types/lines.</div>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>What should be done if nuclear morphology of the recovered WBCs shows physical damages (<a href="#expected-outcomes">expected outcomes</a> section)?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is recommended to be more careful about the selection/use of the micropipette while re-suspending cell pellet at the final step of the cell recovery. It is advisable to use tips with wide opening, such as tips used in 20–200 μL or 100–1000 μL micropipettes to avoid mechanical shear, which may lead to physical injury to the nuclear membrane of the preserved WBCs.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>What should be done if pH of the working FCS is falling out of the described range (<a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section, Mixture 3)?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If all constituents are added/mixed properly as described above, pH of the working FCS will fall in the range of 2.3–3.1. However, if pH is falling out of the described range, it is recommended, not to adjust pH using any acid or alkali, prepare fresh working FCS solution, discard older one.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>How can low temperature stored (4°C) blood sample be fixed with FCS, is the procedure same as for the fixation of fresh blood (Step 1, in <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a>)?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Allow low temperature (4°C) stored blood sample (maximum stored up to 24 h) to approach to the room temperature (RT). Then, mix it well either with the help of 1 mL micropipette or by gently inverting the blood containing tube (8–10 times) manually. Once RT is achieved, blood sample can be poured drop by drop in the FCS tube with gentle shake, as described above.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>How often should the user check the pH of blank FCS (<a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section, Mixture 3)?</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If, blank FCS is stored in an airtight container, pH need not be checked on a regular basis, as on opening of the tube, pH goes up owing to evaporation of glacial acetic acid, which can be avoided. pH should be checked just before the use of the FCS vials; if pH is falling out of the recommended range, these vials should be discarded and fresh vials need to be prepared.</p>
