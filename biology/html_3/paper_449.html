<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><i>In vivo</i> cell migration is influenced by soluble factors as well as stiffness. Current <i>in vitro</i> strategies mostly account for one of these two factors to study cell migration. To understand the combinatorial effect of stiffness and chemokines on cell behavior, we have developed a microfluidic model to study stiffness-dependent chemotaxis of mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). A detailed description of our methodology will help researchers develop microfluidic models that combine these two factors influencing cell behavior.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Saxena et al. (2018)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Fabrication of substrates softer than 3 kPa stiffness is possible; however, lower stiffness substrates are sticky and tend to form surface deformations on the substrates during bonding the microfluidic devices. These deformations can lead to the blockage of microfluidic channels.</p>
<p>For maintaining chemotactic gradient longer than 12 h, a syringe pump has to be used.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Presence of dust particles on the surface of PDMS.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Always prepare substrates and PDMS devices in a dust free environment. After soft-lithography, clean the devices using scotch tape. Check under a microscope before and after assembling the device and avoid using the devices with blocked channels.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Improper bonding of device to substrate.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Plasma-based bonding is irreversible. Improper exposure time or energy of plasma may affect the bonding efficiency leading to leakage in the devices. If using a Harrick-plasma machine, always clean the chamber with isopropyl alcohol after use. This will help to maintain the required plasma energy essential for bonding. If using a different plasma machine, follow the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
<p>Always check devices under a microscope after adding the ECM protein if there is a leakage. Discard leaky devices.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>PDMS regaining hydrophobicity.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is critical to add ECM protein to the assembled devices within 15 min of bonding. Add sufficient amount of ECM protein (∼60 μL) to the device to minimize drying inside the devices.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Cell survival.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The volume of media inside the device is in small quantity along with ∼10,000 cells. It is difficult for the cells to attach and spread initially. To facilitate cell attachment and spreading, add fresh media to the device every 1 or 2 h for the initial 6 h duration.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Since the transverse channel size is 35 μm (the viewing chamber), it is difficult to figure out the cell boundary.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To address this, we have stained cells with Hoechst 33342 to track the cell movement by following its nucleus. Alternatively, the cell itself can be stained using any cell tracking dye (CellTracker CMTPX Dye) to visualize their morphology and movement.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Difficulty in having cells at the required viewing area and on one side of the channel.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Since there are two inlets and two outlets, the cells always tend to remain at inlets or outlets. Therefore, the key to it is to have a proper pressure drop across all the ports to have a significant number of cells in the side channel. Always use less volume of media to obtain pressure balance.</p>
