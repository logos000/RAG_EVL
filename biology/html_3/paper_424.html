<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The elastic properties of cell membranes, particularly the membrane tension and bending modulus, are known to be key regulators of cellular functions. Here, we present a correlative and integrated tool based on optical tweezers and scanning electron microscopy to accurately determine these properties in a variety of cell types. Although there are intrinsic difficulties associated with correlative experiments, we believe that the methods presented can be considered a suitable protocol for determining the elastic properties of cell membranes.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib16">Soares et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>In this method, a membrane tether is extracted via optical tweezers (OT) and the force required to perform tether extraction is obtained during the experiment, while the tether radius is later measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The most challenging step to successfully obtain the elastic properties of the cells is to perform SEM. The protocol presented here describes in detail the step-by-step procedure to precisely measure the tether force using OT and the tether radius using SEM. Thus, regardless of the difficulties related to accomplish the correlative experiment, this protocol gives precise and reliable values for the elastic properties of cell membranes.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> step 4, 2–3 h</div>
<p>The following steps describe the preparation of glass-bottom dishes for tether radius measurements using SEM.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Glass-bottom dishes can be either purchased directly from a specific manufacturer or can be prepared following the protocol described below. This is strongly suggested for SEM measurements of tether radius, as coverslip removal is facilitated if this procedure is performed. Coverslip removal is an important step during sample preparation and observation in the electron microscope.</div>
<ol>
<li>Procedures for cleaning, marking, and sterilizing the coverslips.<br> Coverslips should have the following specifications: dimensions (L × W): 18 × 18 mm or 20 × 20 mm; thickness: 0.13–0.17 mm.
<ol type="a">
<li>Using a glass-writing diamond pen, carefully draw a small square (dimensions [L × W], 1 × 1 mm) in the center of the coverslip. Repeat the procedure for several other coverslips (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).

</figure>
</li>
<li>Clean the coverslips by incubating them in a container with a 30% nitric acid solution for at least 2 h. This step is crucial in order to remove any type of material (debris) that may be attached to the coverslip surface, such as grease, dust, or even glass remnants.</li>
<li>Remove the cleaning solution, wash the coverslips three times by incubating them in deionized water and finally incubate them in a second container with 100% ethanol for at least 2 h.</li>
<li>Remove all the coverslips from the ethanol bath and let them dry completely. Then, place the coverslips in an autoclave-safe container for sterilization.</li>

</figure>
<ol type="a">
<li>A 10 mm diameter hole saw attached to a drill is required to produce the central hole at the bottom surface of 35 mm culture dishes.</li>
<li>Each dish must be positioned perpendicular to the hole saw, in a way that the dish is oriented vertically, and the hole saw is oriented horizontally.</li>
<li>Discard all debris from the drilling and repeat the steps for as many dishes as needed.</li>
<li>Polish the boundaries of the hole at the outer face of the dishes to smoothen the edges. We suggest to use a sharp knife, a scalp, or even a sander for this procedure. This is a crucial step to remove any remaining plastic spiky tips as these can directly influence proper coverslip attachment.</li>
<li>Immerse the dishes in a container with a 70% ethanol solution for at least 2 h.</li>
<li>Remove the dishes and let them dry at 20°C–25°C.</li>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Make sure that neither the coverslips nor the dishes contain plastic or glass debris.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Avoid as much as possible to directly touch the dishes and coverslips with your fingers. Always handle the dishes by touching their outer rim, wear gloves, and use tweezers during the procedure.</div>

<li>Organizing and preparing the materials to attach the coverslips onto the bottom of the dishes.
<ol type="a">
<li>Add a considerable amount of paraffin wax into a glass container. We normally use between 20 g and 100 g of paraffin wax.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The amount of paraffin wax used depends on the number of dishes to be prepared. We usually prepare between 20 and 50 dishes with the amount reported above. Paraffin wax can be stored at 20°C–25°C.</div>
</li>
<li>Once ready, place the container onto a hot plate. Make sure that the temperature varies between 58°C and 62°C, the melting point of paraffin. The melted paraffin will then be used to attach the coverslips to the dishes.</li>
<li>Get an instrument capable of accurately and safely transporting the melted paraffin to the dishes. We use a glass rod.</li>

<li>Hold the dish and place the coverslip on the outer side of its bottom (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>A). Then, bring them closer to the melted paraffin container. Hold the dish always at its outer rim.</li>
<li>Use the instrument described in session 3 (glass stick) to collect the melted paraffin and gently drop it at the four corners of the coverslip (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>B). Repeat the procedure until you have all the glass vertices covered with paraffin and in contact with the outer surface of the dish.</li>
<li>Collect the melted paraffin again, but now spread it across all the coverslip perimeter, always covering the external surface of the dish. Repeat the procedure until all the coverslip perimeter is covered with paraffin (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>C).</li>
<li>Note that the coverslip will be fixed to the external part of the bottom of the dish as the paraffin solidifies.</li>
<li>Repeat all the steps for as many dishes as needed.</li>
<li>Wait until the paraffin completely solidifies at 20°C–25°C in all the dishes manipulated.</li>
<li>Bring all the glass-bottom dishes to a biological safety cabinet and turn on the UV light for at least 1 h to sterilize them. After that, the glass-bottom dishes are ready to be used.</li>

<p>The following steps describe the procedures used to culture cells for tether radius and force measurements. We have performed this procedure with a variety of cell types, including fibroblasts, astrocytes, neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, glioblastoma, macrophages, cardiomyocytes, erythrocytes, and neural precursor cells (<a href="#bib1">Ayala et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib4">Hissa et al., 2013</a>, <a href="#bib5">2017</a>; <a href="#bib10">Pontes et al., 2011; 2013</a>; <a href="#bib11">2017a</a>; <a href="#bib12">2017b</a>; <a href="#bib16">Soares et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib3">Gomez et al., 2020</a>).

<h3 id="sec1.4">Optical tweezers alignment</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2–4 h</div>
<p>There are some excellent reviews in the literature that visually demonstrate the step-by-step procedures on how to align an OT. We strongly recommend reading (<a href="#bib9">Nicholas et al., 2014</a>), section 3.7, where an elegant description of the procedure has been carefully conducted. With two mirrors a distance apart, the laser beam can be steered to enter a port of an inverted microscope and be reflected by a dichroic mirror (DM) to impinge on the objective lens parallel to its axis (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). If this procedure is correctly performed, the bright focus spot of the laser and its concentric diffraction rings observed when the laser is reflected in the air-coverslip interface, after passing through the objective lens, will not be laterally displaced while the objective lens moves back and forth.</p>

<p>Note that the OT laser is directed to the microscope and reaches the back entrance of the objective lens after being reflected by the dichroic mirror (DM).

<h3 id="sec1.5">OT calibration</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2–4 h</div>
<p>Among different applications, an optically trapped microsphere can act as a mechanotransducer, where the readout position of the bead (a mechanical probe) will allow force spectroscopy experiments limited by thermal fluctuations (<a href="#bib8">Neuman and Nagy, 2008</a>; <a href="#bib7">Liu et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib14">Schnoering et al., 2019</a>). To perform these tasks, it is crucial to obtain the trap stiffness, which converts a displacement Δ<i>x</i> of the bead from its equilibrium position into a force <i>F</i> according to the relation <i>F</i> = kΔ<i>x</i> (Hooke’s law).</p>
<p>There are extensive reviews in the literature describing in detail different OT calibration methods (<a href="#bib2">Gieseler et al., 2020</a>; N.B.V., unpublished data), and the advantages and disadvantages of all methods. Here, we describe one of the simplest calibration procedures based on the Stokes-Faxén law for the viscous drag force acting on a microsphere immersed within a fluid (<a href="#bib9">Nicholas et al., 2014</a>; N.B.V., unpublished data).</p>
<p>The main idea of this calibration procedure is sketched in <a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a> and <a href="#fig7">7</a>.</p>

<ol start="10">
<li>Positioning the microsphere at a given height <i>h</i>
<ol type="a">
<li>A dielectric microsphere with a known radius <i>r</i> (value provided by the manufacturer) and immersed in a liquid (water) with viscosity <i>η</i> should be optically trapped using a tightly focused laser beam by an objective lens.</li>
<li>Then, the translational stage, to which the objective lens is usually attached, is set to move along the direction <i>z</i> until the microsphere gently touches the coverslip (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>A). The stage should then be translated back by a distance <i>d</i> until the microsphere reaches a height <i>h</i> (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>B), which is given by <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si9.jpg" alt="Si9.jpg">, where <i>n<sub>w</sub></i> and <i>n<sub>g</sub></i> are, respectively, the refractive indices of the water and glass coverslip.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> As an example, let us consider a polystyrene microsphere with radius <i>r</i> = (7.9 ± 0.7)<i>μm</i> (value provided by the manufacturer) immersed in water at temperature <i>T</i> = (24.1 ± 0.1)<i>°C</i> and dynamic viscosity <i>η</i> = (0.92 ± 0.04)<i>cP</i>, and optically trapped by a laser with a central wavelength of <i>λ</i> = 1064<i>nm</i>, power of <i>P</i> = (127 ± 1)<i>mW</i> and focused by a Nikon 100× Plan APO NA 1.4 objective lens. The corresponding refractive indices of water and glass for that wavelength are, respectively, given by <i>n<sub>w</sub></i> ≈ 1.3260 and <i>n<sub>g</sub></i> ≈ 1.5066. Choosing <i>d</i> = (5 ± 1)<i>μm</i>, where the estimated uncertainty comes from the positioning of the microscope translational stage, we then have <i>h</i> = (12.3 ± 0.9)<i>μm</i>, where the uncertainty is calculated by propagating the usual square root formula for squared error propagation of uncorrelated quantities.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The bead solution must be stored at 4°C and follow all the manufacturer’s recommendations.</div>
<ol start="11">
<li>Creating a fluid flow around the microsphere.
<ol type="a">
<li>Once the microsphere is properly displaced to a known height <i>h</i>, the translational stage should be set to move along the <i>x</i> direction to create a fluid flow with a given velocity <i>v</i> around the microsphere, which then experiences a drag force along the <i>x</i> axis. This force will push the microsphere in the direction of flow. As sketched in <a href="#fig7">Figures 7</a>A and 7B, the OT will then exert a restoring force on the microsphere pulling it back to its initial position. The result of this “tug of war” is a new equilibrium position for the microsphere where <i>k</i>Δ<i>x</i> = <i>γv</i>, in which Δ<i>x</i> represents the difference between the new and the unperturbed equilibrium positions, and <i>γ</i> is the drag coefficient, given by: <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si26.jpg" alt="Si26.jpg">. Knowing <i>γ</i> and measuring Δ<i>x</i> enable us to infer the trap stiffness <i>k</i> along the <i>x</i> direction.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Considering the previous example and substituting the values of <i>r</i> and <i>h</i> in the equation for the drag coefficient, we obtain <i>γ</i> = (2.1 ± 0.1) × 10<sup>-7</sup><i>Kg/s</i>, where the uncertainty was again calculated by propagating the errors.</div>
</li>
<li>A fluid flow can be created around the microsphere by translating the microscope stage with alternating and increasing known velocities, for example using values ranging from 7.5<i>μm/s</i> to 20<i>μm/s</i>, where the uncertainty <i>δv</i> of each velocity is given by <i>δv</i>/<i>v</i> = 0.05. The microsphere will then move from the unperturbed equilibrium position, and a typical plot of that movement is represented in <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>A, which shows the measured positions of the optically trapped microsphere’s center of mass as a function of time.

</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Each cycle of forward and backward movements with a given velocity allows us to obtain the equilibrium positions <i>x<sub>+</sub></i> and <i>x<sub>-</sub></i>. For example, the cycle for <i>v</i> = 10.0<i>μm/s</i> is highlighted with dashed red rectangles in <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>A. The displacement of the microsphere is then given by <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si35.jpg" alt="Si35.jpg">. Calculating the average forward ⟨<i>x<sub>+</sub></i>⟩ and backward ⟨<i>x<sub>-</sub></i>⟩ displacements inside each of the dashed rectangles, together with the corresponding standard deviations <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si38.jpg" alt="Si38.jpg"> and <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si39.jpg" alt="Si39.jpg">, we then have the average displacement <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si40.jpg" alt="Si40.jpg">, together with the corresponding standard deviation <i>σ<sub>Δx</sub></i> given by <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si42.jpg" alt="Si42.jpg">. As a result, the measured displacement will be Δ<i>x</i> = (⟨Δ<i>x</i>⟩ ± <i>σ</i><sub>Δ<i>x</i></sub>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="12">
<li>Linear Regression of the Δ<i>x</i> versus <i>v</i> plot.
<ol type="a">
<li>Repeating this procedure for all cycles corresponding to different velocities, we can gather the results and draw the plot of Δ<i>x</i> for each velocity <i>v</i> (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>B). Performing a linear regression on the data Δ<i>x</i> = <i>A</i> + <i>Bv</i>, and using the equation above for the equilibrium condition, the angular coefficient will then be equal to <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si45.jpg" alt="Si45.jpg">, which allows us to obtain the trap stiffness <i>k</i>, with the corresponding uncertainty <i>δk</i> given by <img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/424-Si47.jpg" alt="Si47.jpg">, where <i>δγ</i> and <i>δB</i> are the corresponding uncertainties in <i>γ</i> and <i>B</i> (the latter coming from the linear fit).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Again considering the previous example, <i>B</i> = (0.024 ± 0.001)<i>s</i>, and consequently, <i>k</i> = (8.8 ± 0.6)<i>pN/nm</i>, being 1<i>pN</i> = 10<sup>-12</sup>N. From the above result, we can observe that the relative uncertainty 100(<i>δk </i>/<i>k</i>) in the above method of calibration is approximately equal to 7%. To estimate statistical errors, the trap stiffness must be evaluated for at least three complete cycles with all the velocities.</div>
<ol start="13">
<li>Trap stiffness <i>k</i> as a function of the laser power <i>P</i> at the entrance of the objective lens
<ol type="a">

<h3 id="sec2.1">Membrane tether extraction using optical tweezers</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min for preparation; 30 min to 1 h of total acquisition for each sample</div>
<p>To perform the following steps, it is necessary to ensure that the OT system was aligned and calibrated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Equipment preparation: this section describes the steps that precede image acquisition and what should be set before introducing the sample to the system.
<ol type="a">
<li>Stabilization of all system components<br> The equipment assembly is shown in <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>. First, one should turn on all the electronic components: power supply of the OT laser; microscope; positioning stage; computer and all other accessories; temperature control; atmosphere control and any other component that may exist in the assembly. The anti-vibration table should also be activated in this step. Once the computer is initialized, certify that all the required software is loaded correctly. In our system, a joystick is used to better control the stage position. Any such gadget should be started, calibrated, and/or verified at this moment.

<p>(A) OT microscope representation.</p>
<p>(B) Zoom showing the culture chamber attached to the OT microscope system.</p>
<p>Note that the infrared laser is directed to the microscope and reaches the back entrance of the objective lens. The culture chamber used in our system controls temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, allowing real-time and living cell experiments.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Microscope objective lens inspection<br> For tether extraction experiments with OT, an appropriate objective lens with a numerical aperture (NA) between 1.2 and 1.4 must be used. In our system, a PLAN APO 100× 1.4 NA DIC H Nikon objective lens is used. This type of lens requires careful manipulation and storage to avoid any dust accumulation on its surface. At this step, the chosen lens, previously calibrated, should be installed or checked for proper connection (<a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>).</li>
<li>Temperature Stabilization<br> To extract tethers from living cells, strict control of temperature and other optimal culture conditions is essential. The temperature must be set according to the cell culture of interest, using a temperature control system attached to the microscope. In our setup, an acrylic chamber encloses the sample holder (<a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>). Since the entire optical system can experience some variation with temperature, it is recommended to wait for temperature stabilization inside the chamber before introducing the sample. In our system, this step can take up to 15–30 min.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Sample preparation and positioning: this sub-step assumes that cells were previously cultured in the aforementioned glass-bottom dishes.
<ol type="a">
<li>Dispersing the beads within the sample<br> Polystyrene beads are used as probes for the OT. These beads must be dispersed in the medium before tether extraction.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The use of a biological safety cabinet and properly sterilized materials is advised to avoid contaminants that might interfere with the results. The optimal number of beads to be added to the sample will depend on the size of the sample dish and the volume of culture medium utilized. For a glass-bottom dish with 8.8 cm<sup>2</sup> of bottom surface area and 2 mL of culture medium, 1 μL of a bead solution (number of beads estimated at 1.68 × 10<sup>6</sup> beads) has worked properly in our setup.</div>
</li>
<li>Adjusting the sample position in the microscope<br> Once the beads are dispersed, the glass-bottom dish can be placed into the microscope. The NA of the used objective lens implies that an immersion oil objective lens is used. The lens immersion medium should be applied immediately before sample positioning. In our setup, the sample is positioned inside an atmosphere-controlled acrylic chamber. After the sample is moved to the chamber, the objective lens is approached to the glass-bottom dish until the immersion oil touches the outer bottom face of the coverslip.</li>
<li>For living cells: adjusting CO<sub>2</sub> level<br> After proper placement of the sample, the CO<sub>2</sub> controlled injection system can be turned on. The setup used is illustrated in <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>. For most cell cultures, a CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 5% is used, reproducing the conditions of a cell incubator. Wait for the CO<sub>2</sub> stabilization. If atmosphere control is not needed, this step can be skipped. If a different CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is needed, adjust accordingly.</li>
<li>Kohler Illumination<br> With both atmosphere and temperature control stabilization, the Kohler Illumination procedure must be employed to ensure that the sample is optimally illuminated.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The procedure for tether force measurement relies on image analysis. If the optical system is not properly aligned, the generated image can be less clear, and the tether force values wrongly determined.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Obtaining the OT equilibrium position for the reference bead<br> For this section, the equilibrium position of a trapped bead is determined as a reference for zero force.
<ol type="a">
<li>Setting the laser output<br> The laser equipment in our setup [an infrared, 1,064 nm, polarized and collimated laser beam model YLR-5-1064-LP (IPG Photonics, NY, USA)] allows output controls in percentage parameters, from 0% to 100% of its emission power capacity. To perform tether extraction experiments, the laser power that reaches the back focal plane of the objective lens should be around 1 W. In our setup, the powermeter is placed above the microscope stage (<a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>). Ensure that the laser power is checked before and after the tether pulling experiments, to avoid any variation that might affect the tether force measurements.

</figure>
</li>
<li>Video capture parameters<br> In the chosen video acquisition software, one should define the capture parameters. Although the resolution is limited by the available frame grabber, the imaging software usually allows controlling the frames/second (fps) and the total acquisition time. The minimum recommended frame rate for capture is 10 fps. As for the total time, the minimum recommendation is 20 s.</li>
<li>Video of the reference bead<br> Find a region of the sample clean of debris and cells. Turn on the laser in the chosen power intensity and trap a bead with the OT. Start the video capture, at the established parameters. Save the video and tag it accordingly.</li>

</li>
<li>Adhering the OT-trapped bead to the cell surface<br> Approach the OT-trapped bead to the cell surface by pressing it against the cell membrane for 5–10 s (<a href="#fig12">Figures 12</a>B and 12C).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To press the bead against the cell surface, first place the OT-trapped bead above a chosen cell, then use the microscope and move the focus toward the coverslip. Consequently, the OT-trapped bead will also move toward the coverslip until it touches the cell surface. As soon as it touches the cell surface, you should be able to identify a visual change in the OT-trapped bead image, caused by a slight displacement in the optical axis direction, indicating the pressure done by the OT.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In our experiments, we typically use uncoated polystyrene beads as we have previously demonstrated that bead coating or size do not affect tether pulling (<a href="#bib13">Pontes et al., 2011</a>). The coating only helps to induce a more efficient first contact between the bead and cell surface. The most important caution must be to properly press the OT-trapped bead against the cell surface. The beads are attached to the cell surface by nonspecific adhesions which likely involve Van der Waals forces.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> This step should be performed as fast as possible, since the contact of the bead with the cell membrane distorts the nearby cytoskeleton, reorienting actin filaments lining from parallel to perpendicular to the membrane surface, and even attempting to phagocyte the bead if allowed enough time, especially in professional phagocytes (<a href="#bib6">Icard-Arcizet et al., 2008</a>).</div>
</li>
<li>Membrane tether extraction experiment<br> After waiting for bead attachment, use the positioning stage to move the entire sample (in the <i>xy</i> direction), trying to separate the bead from the cell. This step can be performed with controlled velocity. In our setup, we typically use velocity of 1.0 μm/s. Other velocities can be used according to the sample (<a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>D). It should be possible to roughly see the shape of the tether if the optical system is clear enough. Pull until a distance of 3–5 bead diameters is reached, to properly extend the tether. Keep the tether extended for the remaining time of the video acquisition. After video completion, turn the laser emission off and observe the bead recoil (<a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>E).
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Bead recoil is an important step for validating the measurement. If the bead is pulled back in the direction of the membrane, this indicates the presence of a membrane tether (<a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>E). If the bead resumes regular Brownian motion, the tether might have broken or might even not have been formed at all. It is also possible to observe more than one tether attached to the bead at the same time. In this case, the recoil movement of the bead is erratic, oscillating between two or more directions. Some other interferences, such as vibrations or debris, can disturb the experiment, requiring repetition of the measurement.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> An interesting analogy is to compare the procedure to a tug of war between the OT and the cell, both trying to hold the bead. At a given moment the OT wins by pulling out part of the cell surface in the form of a membrane tube or tether.</div>
</li>
<li>Repeat until conclusion<br> After correctly recording a membrane tether extraction, repeat the steps initiating in a. Repetition should be performed for at least 20 different times and from different cells on the dish.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec2.2">Measuring the membrane tether force</h3>
<p>This section describes the steps and procedures to precisely measure the tether force.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Measurement of laser output<br> As mentioned before, the value of laser power <i>P</i> that reaches the sample is used to determine <i>k</i> and, therefore, the tether force, <i>F</i><sub>0</sub>. To verify the laser power, a powermeter is used. For the assembly illustrated, it is necessary to remove both the microscope condenser unit and the objective lens. Usually, as cited earlier, the mean value of power should be around 1 W (<a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>). At least 2 different measurements of power should be performed, before and after the tether pulling experiment, to obtain the mean value of power with its respective error bar.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The value acquired is not the power that reaches the sample, since a large fraction of the power is dispersed when passing through the objective lens system. The transmittance of the lens should be evaluated and accounted for, during calibration.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> If your OT system is calibrated and stable, small variations in power are acceptable (in our setup, 5%–10% variations are considered acceptable). However, if one observes a drastic variation we suggest checking the stability of the system as well as the origin of such variation before redoing all the experiments.</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Data analysis<br> In this step, the videos obtained previously are analyzed to determine the variation between the probe’s position during each tether extraction procedure and the corresponding position of zero force reference. This variation in position Δ<i>x</i> can be plotted versus the acquisition time, and, using the parameters defined during calibration, to generate a plot of the force applied to the probe versus the elapsed time. A bead trapped in the OT acts as an object attached to a spring. A radial deviation from the bead’s rest position results in a force <i>F</i> in the opposite direction, that can be modeled through Hooke’s Law as: <i>F</i> = <i>k</i> Δ<i>x</i>, where <i>k</i> was defined in the calibration section and is related to the laser power, the index of refraction of the medium, and other known parameters. Thus, this model allows determination of the force <i>F</i> applied to the trapped bead using its position variation relative to a reference position.
<ol type="a">
<li>Establishing the probe’s position using an image analysis software<br> The image processing exemplified here uses the ImageJ software. However, the principles described should be reproducible using other programs that employ equivalent tools. The same process is used for both the reference position and tether extraction videos.
<ol type="i">
<li>Open file<br> In the “File” tab, select “Open” and find the video to be analyzed. For the video processing step, it is recommended to analyze each video individually (<a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a>).

</li>
<li>Threshold<br> With the video window selected, click in the “Image” tab, select “Adjust” and then “Threshold.” In the new window, keep the options “Default” and “B&amp;W.” Adjust the parameters to ensure that the centralized bead is in optimal contrast when compared to the background (<a href="#fig14">Figure 14</a>). The lower slider should be dragged to 255. The upper slider should be adjusted until the bead resembles the example shown.

<p>Note the threshold parameters (left window) and how the movie looks after processed by the threshold function (right window).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>Analyzing particle position<br> Using the rectangular selection tool, outline a region around the trapped bead. Each wall of the rectangle should be at about one diameter far from the bead. This ensures that the analysis is made within the selected area, thus saving processing time. In the tab “Analyze,” choose “Analyze particles.” In the “Size” section, determine a minimum size in the range of 50–100 pixels. That keeps the software from calculating the position of smaller and without interest particles. In the “Show” section, select “Outlines.” This option produces outline images of what the software identified as a particle and serves as quality control of this step. Also, select the options “Exclude on edges” and “Display results” (<a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a>). The first removes the frames in which the particle touched or crossed the selection boundaries. The second displays a table of results with the XY position, for each frame of the particle i.e., the probe. With all the proper options selected, process all frames. Examine the produced images of the outlines, assessing if the software computed particle positions other than the ones of the probe. Save the resulting table accordingly. If there are more position points than frames, the software recognized multiple particles at some frame. Repeat the procedure, adjusting the threshold and size filtering. If needed, it is possible to manually remove the positions of other non-desired particles from the table. Repeat this procedure until all videos are processed and all corresponding tables are obtained (<a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a>).

<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> Using ImageJ, it is possible to create a macro that automatically computes a series of predetermined actions. This can be performed intuitively by clicking in the “Plugins” tab, and selecting the option “Record,” under “Macros.” In this mode, the software records every input and creates a correspondent script that will repeat the same processes when loaded again, so that the series of steps previously described can be performed in a faster way. It is important to check the quality of the process in the same ways described before.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Determining the tether force using the data analysis software<br> For this step, data analysis software is required. In our system we use the KaleidaGraph software (Version 4.5.3; Synergy Software); however, other software packages with similar capabilities can also be selected accordingly.
<ol type="i">
<li>Determining the reference position in terms of an XY coordinate<br> If using KaleidaGraph, open the XY coordinates corresponding to the reference position video for the sample to be analyzed. When opening a text file, a window appears and allows for the selection of the correct input format. For tables generated using ImageJ, select “Tab” under “Delimiter;” choose “=1” for “Number;” and select “Read Titles.” Then, select “OK” (<a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a>). The opened table should present three columns: video frame number, X positions and Y positions (<a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a>). The values required are the mean values of position for both the X and Y axis. Select the X column by clicking in its title, click in “Summary Statistics” and retrieve the mean position from the generated list. Repeat the same for the Y column. Alternatively, run the command “mean(c#)” in the Formula Entry window, to determine the mean value of a column of # number. Either way, both mean values should be obtained (<a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a>).

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The table generated by ImageJ (<a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a>) is a text file, presenting three columns. The first column (left to right) refers to the frame number and has no title. The second column, titled YM, presents the vertical positions for the center of mass of the probe, and the last one (XM) has the horizontal positions. If using another software, one should take the input table (from the reference video) and define the reference position. For that, one should retrieve the statistical mean for the numerical values in both YM and XM data columns. Be aware that in ImageJ these columns have tab-separated values, and the decimal separator is a period<i>.</i>
</div>
</li>
<li>Input for equations<br> If using another software, go directly to the note of this section.<br> If using KaleidaGraph, open the “Formula Entry” window. It is possible to store equations that can be later applied to the data table. To obtain the tether force, , a sequence of mathematical transformations is required. The frame number column should be converted into an elapsed time column, using the known frame rate. For example, the formula “c3=c0/10” creates a column in the c3 position where each frame (c0 column) is converted to a value in s, since the frame rate used in our example was 10 fps (<a href="#fig19">Figure 19</a>). The next equation is c4 = ((c1-XMref)ˆ2+(c2-YMref)ˆ2)ˆ0.5/12.46. “XMref” and “YMref” are the average XM and YM values of the reference probe. “c1” and “c2” represent the columns with the position values on the X and Y axis, respectively, for the tether extraction procedure. This equation uses the Pythagoras theorem to establish the bead position deviation between the reference position and the measurement in question. It then creates a column with the variation value, for each frame, in the “c4” position. The number 12.46 is a conversion factor of pixels to micrometers, in our camera setup resolution. This value should be previously determined (<a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a>). The third equation is an adaptation from the Hooke’s Law: c5 = c4 × 0.25 × 1,050. In this equation, 1,050 is the value, in mW, of the laser power and 0.25 is the optical tweezers spring constant <i>k</i> per unit of power. Both values are acquired through calibration (see calibration section for more details). Thus, “c4” represents the position variation, c5 represents the force applied to the bead and 0.25 × 1,050 is the final result for the OT spring constant <i>k</i> (<a href="#fig21">Figure 21</a>).

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Typical tether force values for cell membranes range from 7 to 145 pN, depending on the cell type and context. A summary table with all these values, together with the experimental conditions in which measurements were obtained can be found in Table 1 of <a href="#bib11">Pontes et al. (2017a)</a>.</p>
<p>Typical tether radius values range from 35 to 144 nm, also depending on the cell type and context. This range of values can be found in several publications from our group (<a href="#bib1">Ayala et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib4">Hissa et al., 2013</a>, <a href="#bib5">2017</a>; <a href="#bib13">Pontes et al., 2011</a>, <a href="#bib10">2013</a>, <a href="#bib11">2017a</a>, <a href="#bib12">2017b</a>; <a href="#bib16">Soares et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>CMT and CMBM, as well as their changes, have been characterized as important regulators of cellular behaviors, especially those related to shape changes and force production (<a href="#bib12">Pontes et al., 2017b</a>; <a href="#bib15">Sitarska and Diz-Munoz, 2020</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The main limitation to execute this protocol is the intrinsic difficulty in performing the method itself, since it is an integration of correlative microscopy-based procedures ranging from videomicroscopy and live-cell imaging to OT and SEM. Access to instruments and facilities to perform all the steps described can also be a major limitation. Finally, the quality of the glass-bottom dishes depends on who prepares them. You can learn to prepare good quality glass-bottom dishes in a few days. We recommend practicing in advance before starting the entire experiment. We suggest using the 35 mm culture dishes indicated in the <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Glass-bottom dishes leak after sealing.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Try to reinforce the contact between the glass coverslip and the dish by adding another layer of paraffin, particularly for those experiments where cells need to be cultured for several days before the tether extraction.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Ruptured membrane tethers during SEM sample preparation.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>To avoid tether rupture, try to change the SEM solutions with great care, always removing from the side of the plate (away from the center, where cells with the extracted tethers are located). Moreover, we observed that by always leaving a remaining amount of liquid in the center (covering the cells), one can significantly reduce the chances of causing tether rupture.</p>
