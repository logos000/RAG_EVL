<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Adult neurogenesis, a process of generating newborn neurons from adult neural stem cells, is required for brain homeostasis, cognition, and affective behaviors. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying adult neurogenesis will provide valuable insights into the functional integrity of the adult brain and the etiology of neurological disorders. Here, we present an optimized protocol combining stereotactic injection of retrovirus expressing red fluorescent protein to label newborn neurons and implantation of a mini-osmotic pump to investigate newborn neuron development in adult mouse hippocampus.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib9">Tang et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–2 days</div>
<p>Mini-osmotic pump is an ideal system for prolonged direct drug delivery into specific brain region at a fixed flow rate (<a href="#bib7">Reitmeir et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib10">Wang et al., 2019</a>). Adult neurogenesis can be divided into five phases: proliferation, fate determination, migration, maturation and integration at different time course (<a href="#bib1">Bond et al., 2015</a>). So implantation of mini-osmotic pump could be performed at a desired time after retroviral injection according the experimental purpose. Previously, we had implanted a mini-osmotic pump to study the role of pleiotrophin (PTN) on the development of newborn neurons after 2 weeks retroviral injection (<a href="#bib9">Tang et al., 2019</a>). A video guide providing excellent visual aid for this procedure may also be found at: <a href="https://www.jove.com/v/52932/implantation-miniosmotic-pumps-delivery-tract-tracers-to-study-brain">https://www.jove.com/v/52932/implantation-miniosmotic-pumps-delivery-tract-tracers-to-study-brain</a> (<a href="#bib8">Sanchez-Mendoza et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>To investigate the effect of PTN on newborn neuron development in adult hippocampus, we stereotactically injected retroviruses expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP) to label newborn neurons (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>A–4C). After two weeks of retroviral injection, we implanted a mini-osmotic pump with PTN into the dentate gyrus of hippocampus (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>D). For the dendritic branching analysis, 100-μm-thick floating brain sections were used. The infected neurons were imaged on an LSM 710 confocal microscope with a 20× oil objective. A 3-dimensional reconstruction of entire dendritic processes of each neuron in the dentate gyrus was made from Z-series stacks of confocal images at 3-μm intervals. The 2D projection images were imported and traced by NIH ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) with a sholl analysis plugin (<a href="https://imagej.net/Sholl">https://imagej.net/Sholl</a>). Data from each infected neuron were extracted for sholl analysis and quantification of total dendritic length. Roughly 20–50 neurons with largely intact dendritic trees per mouse were traced, and at least 4 different animals per groups were analyzed. As expected, infusion of PTN significantly increased the dendritic length and complexity of RFP-positive newborn neurons (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>E and 4F) (<a href="#bib9">Tang et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Since we have used native fluorescence protein to directly detect transgene expression, one possible technical limitation in observing infected cells could have been a presumable low sensitivity of native fluorescence detection. Therefore, the reference protocol for transgene delivery to granule cells and the use of immunohistochemistry and subsequent indirect fluorescence detection is recommended (<a href="#bib12">Tashiro et al., 2006</a>).</p>
<p>The mini-osmotic pumps can carry drugs dissolved in a wide variety of substances, being the limitation to that the solvent is biocompatible. Additionally, given that the volume is small (200 μL) in the mini-osmotic pumps, it must be determined whether the concentration required for the experiment is suitable and will not cause precipitation inside the pump (<a href="#bib8">Sanchez-Mendoza et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Failure of mounting the mouse onto stereotactic apparatus (step 7 and step 41)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that the mouse is fully anesthetized.</p>
<p>Make sure that the mouse front teeth is well latch onto the anterior clamp of the adapter.</p>
<p>Make sure that the ear bars are inserted into the ear canal of the mouse and well fixed.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Failure of retroviral injection (steps 18–25)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that the head is well fixed in the stereotaxic device.</p>
<p>The skull leveling is necessary due to the small size of the subgranule zone of hippocampus.</p>
<p>Ensure that the bregma and lambda are visible, which is necessary for accuracy of the coordinates.</p>
<p>Quickly withdraw retroviruses and avoid exposure too long at room temperature (20°C–25°C).</p>
<p>Slowly and carefully inject retroviruses to reduce pressure damage.</p>
<p>Use the recommended flat-tipped needle to ensure that retroviruses are evenly distributed at dentate gyrus during retroviral injection.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Failure of mini-osmotic pump preparation (steps 30–39)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure that the vehicle/solvent is compatible with polyvinylchloride tubing.</p>
<p>Filter the insoluble precipitated particles in the solution if necessary.</p>
<p>Make sure to wear gloves during perfusion and implantation of mini-osmotic pump.</p>
<p>Filling solution should be performed at 20°C–25°C</p>
<p>Completely fill the mini-osmotic pump and avoid the formation of bubbles.</p>
<p>Notice the dark shadow in the pump indicating the solution level and stop filling until a bead of solution emerging from the pump body.</p>
<p>Carefully fill the flow moderator and the catheter and avoid the formation of bubbles.</p>
<p>Carefully connect the cannula and the catheter and avoid the formation of bubbles.</p>
<p>Double-check whether there are bubbles in the mini-osmotic pump before implantation.</p>
<p>Check whether too much solution is left inside the pump at the end of the experiment.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Failure of mini-osmotic pump implantation (steps 40–49)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure that the needle of cannula is not clogged.</p>
<p>Make sure that the size of subcutaneous tunnel is sufficient to accommodate the pump and permit it to move around, but cannot slip down onto the flank of the mouse.</p>
<p>Ensure that there is enough cyanoacrylate adhesive next to the needle of the cannula, but not directly touch to the needle tip of the cannula.</p>
<p>Ensure that the skull surface around the cannula is clean and dry enough, which is necessary to make the cannula fully adhered to the skull.</p>
<p>Hold the cannula in position for more than 2 min until the cyanoacrylate adhesive is fully dry and the cannula is entirely attached in the skull</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Post-operated recovery time is too long (step 29 and step 54)</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A rectal probe can be used to control the heating system by feeding back the temperature and ensure that the temperature of the mice remains stable at 37°C.</p>
<p>Inject ketoprofen to alleviate the pain during surgery.</p>
<p>Provide soft food and treats for the mouse after surgery.</p>
