<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The existence of a subpopulation of undifferentiated cells with stem-like properties has been suggested in neuroblastoma tumors, but a definitive biomarker for their successful isolation is missing. Here we describe an <i>in vitro</i> culture system for the enrichment in undifferentiated stem-like tumor cells for subsequent functional assays. We make use of clonal non-adherent cell culture conditions together with cell sorting with specific expression markers. This protocol allows for the differential study of heterogeneous cell population in neuroblastoma tumors.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(22)00140-X/sref6">Vega et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The experimental procedures included in this protocol describe the steps to enrich in undifferentiated neuroblastoma (NB) cells from the SK-N-SH cell line, a spontaneously immortalized heterogeneous human NB cell line. However, we have also used this protocol with other NB cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX)-derived primary cells, with minimal modifications. The protocol has been successfully used with SK-N-AS, GI-MEN and GI-CAN cell lines, and can potentially be used to isolate undifferentiated cells from any heterogeneous cell line that present them in any proportion.</p>
<p>A tumorsphere is a solid, spherical formation developed from the proliferation of one cancer stem/progenitor cell, grown in non-adherent conditions with the suitable media. These tumorspheres are easily distinguishable from single or aggregated cells (<a href="#bib7">Johnson et al., 2013</a>). Tumorsphere cultivation, although with some limitations, is widely used to analyze the self-renewal capability of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In addition, the tumorsphere assay may be a promising in vitro strategy in the innovation towards future cancer therapeutics and may help in the screening of anti-cancer small-molecule chemicals (<a href="#bib8">Lee et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p>The described protocol derives from the protocol used to isolate adult stem cells from peripheral nervous tissues like the carotid body (<a href="#bib4">Pardal et al., 2007</a>). Contrary to the protocols normally used with central nervous system and glioblastoma cells, in cells derived from peripheral nervous tissues or the neural crest, serum-rich (15–20%) media is used for the isolation of undifferentiated progenitor cells. Tumorspheres can also be formed using media without serum, but then the undifferentiated character and self-renewal of the cells obtained is compromised (<a href="#bib2">Hong et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib6">Vega et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p>In this protocol, we perform fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) prior to tumorsphere culture to select for CD44 high expressing cells in SK-N-SH cells in order to eliminate adrenergic NB cells from the culture. CD44 is a putative stem cell marker in several solid tumors and it is expressed in a cell population with neural crest stem-like features in neuroblastoma tumors (<a href="#bib6">Vega et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Institutional permissions</h3>
<p>Ethical approvals and institutional permissions are required for the use of experimental mouse xenograft models and Patient-derived-xenografts (PDX). Tumor tissues from mouse xenografts referred in this protocol were obtained from the Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBiS) animal facility with the approval from the local research ethics committee and the Andalusian Tissue Biobank. All experiments conform to the relevant regulatory standards.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of solutions</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–2 h</div>
<p>Required solutions used in this protocol can either be prepared in advance and stored as indicated, or can be made fresh on the day of the experiment. Please refer to the <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> for a complete list of solution recipes.</p>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 days</div>
<ol>
<li>Thawing and sub cultivation.
<ol type="a">
<li>Place cryovial of liquid nitrogen, frozen cells into a water bath at 37°C.</li>
<li>Recover the cells from the vial by gently mixing with growing volume of fresh media to dilute DMSO concentration in the cell suspension.</li>
<li>Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × <i>g</i>.</li>
<li>Resuspend cell pellet with 1 mL of fresh complete media and add to a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flask with 4 mL of pre-warmed media.</li>
<li>Incubate at 37°C in an incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
<li>Once at 80% confluence, sub cultivate and amplify cells by washing the cell monolayer with PBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> twice, before trypsinising with the addition of 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution to the culture.</li>
<li>Incubate 5 min in the incubator, and add 4 mL complete media to inactivate trypsin and avoid cell damage.</li>
<li>Make a uniform cell suspension by pipetting up and down, centrifuge for 5 min at 300 × <i>g</i> and resuspend pellet in 5 mL of fresh complete media.</li>
<li>Quantify cell suspension and reseed the desired number of cells in a new flask.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> we routinely sub cultivate cells by making a 1:20 surface dilution into a new flask. Alternatively, cell suspension can be seeded in bigger surface flasks for expansion. Ensure having a 70–80% confluent low passage (1–5) cell culture with enough cells to start procedure. We recommend starting with at least a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.4">Alternative: Dissociation of tissue sample into cells</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1.5 h</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Primary tissue dissociation.
<ol type="a">
<li>Place the tumor tissue in a 100 mm dish. Mince it into small 2–4 mm pieces using a scalpel.</li>
<li>Place all pieces in a 15 mL plastic tube and add 3 mL of tumor dissociation media. Incubate for 10 min at 37°C in agitation.</li>
<li>Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding 5 mL of IMDM complete medium. Pipette up and down a few times until a homogeneous suspension is achieved.</li>
<li>Pass the result suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer.</li>
<li>Centrifuge 5 min at 300 × <i>g</i> and discard the supernatant, leaving behind dissociated cells pellet.</li>
<li>Add 5 mL of ACK buffer and resuspend carefully to eliminate red blood cells.</li>
<li>Incubate 5 min at room temperature (RT; 18°C–25°C). Centrifuge 5 min at 300 × <i>g</i> and discard the supernatant.</li>
<li>Repeat steps f and g.</li>
<li>Resuspend the cell pellet in IMDM complete media.</li>
<li>Count the number of cells in the suspension and calculate the viability by mixing a small aliquot with an equal volume of trypan blue. Use manual or automatic cell counting.</li>

<h3 id="sec3.1">CD44hi cell sorting – day 1</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5–6 h</div>
<p>CD44hi cells are sorted from neuroblastoma cell lines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain a single cell suspension for labelling.
<ol type="a">
<li>Aspirate media from a tissue culture flask with SK-N-SH cells and gently wash the cells twice with a volume of PBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> enough to cover the cell layer (3 mL for a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flask).</li>
<li>Aspirate PBS and add a volume of Versene enough to cover the cell layer (500 μL for a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flask). Incubate at 37°C in the cell incubator for 5 min.</li>
<li>Stop the dissociation by adding 2 mL of FACS medium and resuspend cells by pipetting up-and-down until a homogeneous cell suspension is achieved.</li>
<li>Transfer cell suspension to a sterile 15 mL plastic tube and centrifuge at 300 × <i>g</i> for 5 min.</li>
<li>Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of FACS medium gently pipetting up and down.</li>
<li>Pass through a sterile cell strainer with 40 μm pore size into a sterile 50 mL tube to remove non-dissociated cell aggregates.</li>
<li>Count the number of cells in the suspension and calculate the viability by mixing a small aliquot with an equal volume of trypan blue. Use manual or automatic cell counting.</li>
<li>Prepare a suspension of at least 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per 100–200 mL of FACS medium for labelling. Prepare also a suspension of at least 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells for unlabeled cells and 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells for cells to be labelled only with secondary antibody as controls.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Proper digestion and preparation of cells into a single cell suspension is crucial for the efficient collection of the fluorescently tagged population.</div>

<li>Labelling of cells for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
<ol type="a">
<li>Incubate sample cell suspension with 1 μg of CD44 primary antibody for 40–60 min on ice.</li>
<li>Wash cells 3 times with 1 mL cold FACS medium with gentle centrifugation (5 min at 300 g and 4°C) between washes.</li>
<li>Incubate on ice for 30 min with Alexa488-donkey-α-mouse at 1:500 dilution in a volume of 200 μL. Keep protected from light from this step on.

<li>Recovery of CD44hi cells.
<ol type="a">
<li>Seed 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> of recovered sorted cells per well in a 6-well ultralow binding plate with 2 mL of pre-warmed NCM. Transfer the 6-well plate to a 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator overnight (6–18 h).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The flow cytometer to be used must have the proper lasers and filters to detect the emission spectrum of the fluorescent protein. We performed flow cytometry analyses and sorting in a BD FACS Aria cytometer, which allows for stringent gating to ensure the collection of a pure population. Users can adjust the gate depending on the stringency of their experiment. Also ensure that sorting is performed under sterile conditions as cells are going to be cultured long-term after the sorting.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> The sorting can be carried out with dissociated cells from tissue samples, like PDXs, as the ones obtained from the alternative step 2 described above. In this case sorting is carried out right after dissociation with a similar strategy. CD24 is used as a negative selection marker in the case of xenographs to eliminate possible CD44+ host cells.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> The following protocol can be performed using unsorted SK-N-SH cells as starting point. In this case, resulting tumorspheres will be enriched in any case in CD44hi cells which can be sorted later to eliminate possible differentiated cells present in the spheres. The main advantage of sorting early rather than sorting after obtaining the tumorspheres is that you can obtain more undifferentiated cells without the interference of the tumorspheres/aggregates formed by CD44- differentiated cells. We would only recommend sorting the resulting tumorspheres to save time at the beginning of the protocol or to remove possible differentiated cells in the tumorspheres.</div>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h</div>
<p>Cells are prepared and seeded for growing as tumorspheres.</p>
<div class="note">

<li>Count the number of cells in the suspension and calculate the viability by mixing a small aliquot with an equal volume of trypan blue. Use manual or automatic cell counting.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We use an automatic cell counter with parameters adjusted to the cell line in use. Direct counting under a microscope with a hemocytometer is also possible. Either way, ensure you have an accurate quantification and, by imaging, that you have a single cell suspension.</div>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Plates can be incubated for 5–10 days, depending on the cells used and the desired outcome. We normally incubate for 7 days.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Upon the completion of this protocol, we obtain multipotent, undifferentiated tumorspheres that are mainly composed by CD44hi/CD114+/Nestin+/DDC- cells. The tumorspheres should be solid, spheric structures, however their size varies, with an median diameter of around 80 μm. Gene expression analysis demonstrates that the cells obtained with this protocol present a mesenchymal (MES) gene expression signature, that can turn into an adrenergic (ADRN) type signature upon differentiation with retinoic acid (<a href="#bib6">Vega et al., 2019</a>) (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig2"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1523-Fig2.jpg" alt="Fig2.jpg">

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 2. CD44hi cells present a MES gene expression signature</div>
<p>Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Published with author’s permission.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The undifferentiated cells obtained maintain their phenotypic characteristics for at least 10 days in culture when properly maintained. They can also be differentiated into neuronal, glial, or mesenchymal lineages using the appropriate differentiation protocols (<a href="#bib6">Vega et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p>With an extended incubation time, tumorspheres will normally generate a visible crown of differentiated adrenergic DDC+ cells.</p>
<p>When sorting cells from fresh tissue samples, some cells from other tissues can express CD44. In our hands, high levels of CD44 in PDXs tumors are mainly seen on tumor cells. Nevertheless, is the tumorsphere serial passage culture condition the one finally selecting for undifferentiated neural crest like cell, not the initial CD44 sorting. Non desirable CD44+ cells initially sorted will not form tumorspheres and will disappear.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Cells obtained with the use of this protocol in SK-N-SH cells present neural crest stem-like features but can not be considered bona-fide neural progenitor cells. Neural progenitor cells can be obtained with a similar protocol from different fresh tissues (<a href="#bib4">Pardal et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#bib5">Platero-Luengo et al., 2014</a>).</p>
<p>The number of cells obtained ranges between 0.5 and 2% of the starting cell number. Obtaining undifferentiated cells from cell lines or PDXs might not be a problem but starting sample material is a limitation when performed from patient samples. Furthermore, there is a great variability in the number of initial CD44hi sorted cells obtained from different samples and cell lines. A heterogeneous NB cell line like SK-N-SH is the optimal situation. Some mesenchymal cell lines might present uniform moderate levels of CD44. In this case it can be more difficult to sort the CD44 high expressing cells and it might be better to perform the tumorsphere assay directly without sorting.</p>
<p>The protocol does not work on cell lines that are very adrenergic and composed of only differentiated cells, such as IMR-32, from which we only obtained spheres with differentiated committed cells.</p>
<p>CD44 is not an exclusive marker of undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells, as it will also mark for example benign Schwann-like stromal cells. Also, only a small proportion of the CD44hi cells form undifferentiated tumorspheres in culture. This must be considered when sorting cell populations and interpreting the data obtained. As there are no definitive and specific cancer stem cell markers described for neuroblastoma tumors, functional experiments with the resulting cells are needed to address multipotency and other properties.</p>
<p>We have only used the protocol successfully with human cells. We have not been able to select for undifferentiated neural crest stem-like cells from spontaneous tumors in the TH-MYCN mouse model. This is probably due to the strong homogeneous adrenergic nature of these tumors (<a href="#bib1">De Wyn et al., 2021</a>). A different protocol to isolate sphere forming cells from TH-MYCN transgenic tumors has been described (<a href="#bib3">Liu et al., 2016</a>), but we have not been able to replicate it.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Big cell aggregates or clumps of tumorspheres are observed, especially on the primary tumorsphere culture (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>; step 7).</p>
<figure id="fig3"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1523-Fig3.jpg" alt="Fig3.jpg">

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 3. Examples of obtained tertiary tumorspheres and potential culture with aggregates</div>
<p>Scale bar: 200 μm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Lower cell density on the original plate. Ensure starting with a single cell suspension. Ensure the minimum movement of the plate and an even flat surface during incubation. Alternatively, to ensure clonality, perform the single cell tumorsphere assay (described above).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Tumorspheres do not dissociate well into single cells in the passages (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use a mechanical or enzymatic dispersion system that suits your cells.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Enough undifferentiated cells cannot be observed from the tumorspheres obtained (step 9).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Some differentiated cells will form also tumorspheres with this method, but with a limited self-renewal potential and no multipotency. Perform functional and expression analysis to ensure the undifferentiated character of the cells obtained with your starting sample/cell line.</p>
<p>Also, some differentiation will be observed in the tumorspheres. Reduce the incubation time on the tumorsphere assay to avoid differentiation and sort the resulting cells to eliminate undesired populations.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Too big or too small tumorspheres are obtained (step 7).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Adjust the incubation time for your sample/cell line so that you obtain tumorsphere big enough to be a source of undifferentiated cells, but not so big so that differentiation is occurring during tumorsphere formation.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Tumorspheres are not obtained (step 7).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure to use fresh NCM medium and supplements. If you still do not obtain tumorspheres after 10–12 days ensure you start with a heterogeneous population as proper tumorspheres will not grow from already differentiated cells.</p>
