<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Renal progenitor cells induced from pluripotent stem cells have attracted attention as a cell source for organ regeneration. Here, we report an <i>in vivo</i> protocol for the regeneration of urine-producing nephrons, i.e., neo-nephrons, in mice. We outline steps to transplant exogenous renal progenitor cells into the nephrogenic zone of transgenic mice and subsequently analyze these neo-nephrons.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Fujimoto et al. (2020)</a>.</p>




<div class="highlights">
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enzymatic dissociation of rodent MNs and induction of NPCs from hiPSCs</li>
<li>Injection of exogenous RPCs into the nephrogenic zone with the elimination of host NPCs</li>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparation of media</h3>
<h4 id="sec1.1.1">Base media for metanephroses (MNs)</h4>
<p>Prepare media for culturing MNs by supplementing MEM α with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The media should be stored at 4°C for up to 1 month.</p>
<h4 id="sec1.1.2">Base media for human nephron progenitor cells (NPCs)</h4>
<p>Prepare media for culturing human NPCs. The media comprises DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2% (vol/vol) B-27 minus vitamin A, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1% (vol/vol) insulin-transferrin-selenium solution, 1% (vol/vol) non-essential amino acids, 90 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin. The media should be stored at 4°C for up to 1 month.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of glass needles</h3>
<p>Prepare glass needles for injections of exogenous renal progenitor cells (RPCs) into the nephrogenic zone. Sharpen thin-walled glass capillaries using a pipette puller, and then cut the end with micro-tweezers. Sterilize the prepared glass needles using heat (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>A).</p>

<h3 id="sec2.1">Mouse mating</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 weeks</div>
<p>Create Six2-GCE+/DTA+ (Six2-DTA) mice that allow specific ablation of <i>Six2</i>-expressing NPCs after exposure to tamoxifen, without damaging exogenous RPCs including human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived NPCs (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A).</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 2. Representative images of Six2-DTA mouse embryos</div>
<p>(A) Schematic of the Six2-CreERT2-diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) system. Nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) consist cap mesenchyme surrounding ureteric buds (UBs). With tamoxifen, CreERT2 in <i>Six2</i>-expressing NPCs accesses the nuclear compartment, removing the <i>loxP</i>-flanked stop sequence. Accordingly, DTA is expressed, and NPCs are ablated while UBs remain unperturbed. Figure reprinted with permission from <a href="#bib2">Fujimoto et al., 2020</a>.</p>
<p>(B) A vaginal plug of a female Rosa26-DTA176 mouse 0.5 days post-coitum (red arrow) and a control.</p>
<p>(C) A metanephros (MN) of a Six2-DTA mouse embryo on embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5). Six2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression by NPCs is observed in the MN. Scale bar, 500 μm.</p>
</figcaption>

<ol>
<li>Mate female/male B6;129-<i>Six2[tm3(EGFP/cre/ERT2) Amc]</i>/J (Six2-GCE) mice (<a href="#bib4">Kobayashi et al., 2008</a>) with male/female B6;129-<i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor[tm1(DTA) Mrc]</i>/J (Rosa26-DTA176) mice (<a href="#bib8">Wu et al., 2006</a>) to obtain offspring Six2-DTA mice. For breeding, use timed mating: consider 12 pm of the day that the vaginal plug was detected as 0.5 days post-coitum (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B).</li>
<li>Six2-GCE mice are heterozygous, while Rosa26-DTA176 mice are homozygous. Therefore, 50% of the embryos are Six2-DTA, which can be identified based on the expression of Six2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) by NPCs in MNs under a fluorescent stereomicroscope (M205FA, Leica Microsystems) (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> MNs contain RPCs, which include NPCs, stromal progenitor cells (SPCs), and ureteric buds (UBs). In contrast, the NPCs derived from hiPSCs according to our protocol do not include SPCs or UBs.</div>
<div class="note"><span class="note-title">Note:</span></div>
<p>The Six2-GCE allele expresses an eGFPCreERT2 (EGFP and creERT2) fusion protein from the <i>Six2</i> promoter/enhancer elements. CreERT2 is restricted to the cytoplasm, and it can only gain access to the nuclear compartment after exposure to tamoxifen. While homozygous Six2-GCE mice die shortly after birth due to the loss of <i>Six2</i> gene function, heterozygous mice are viable and fertile with no reported abnormalities.</p>
<p>The ROSA26-DTA176 mice carry a <i>loxP</i>-flanked stop cassette followed by the coding sequence of an attenuated diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA176) in the <i>Rosa26</i> locus. The DTA176 coding sequence is only expressed after the <i>loxP</i>-flanked stop sequence is removed via Cre-mediated recombination, leading to cell apoptosis. Homozygous ROSA26-DTA176 mice are viable and fertile, with no reported abnormalities.</p>
<p>In the resulting Six2-DTA mice, tamoxifen activates CreERT2 and induces specific DTA expression in <i>Six2</i>-expressing NPCs, leading to apoptosis of NPCs.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Use both Six2-GCE mice and Rosa26-DTA176 mice at 10–25 weeks of age for mating. It does not matter which of the pair is male or female. House all mice in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment with a 12-h light-dark cycle, and provide all mice with standard laboratory chow and water.</div>
<div class="optional">
<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> To ascertain that NPCs of Six2-DTA mice are eliminated using tamoxifen, culture the MNs of those mice on embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). For the organ culture protocol, please refer to steps 16–19. Subsequent immunostaining reveals atrophy of the MNs and almost complete elimination of <i>Six2</i>-expressing NPCs. Furthermore, 4OHT at this concentration does not damage the MNs of nontransgenic mice (<a href="#bib2">Fujimoto et al., 2020</a>).</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Using our method, MNs from Six2-DTA mice serve as niches for the differentiation of exogenous RPCs. In these MNs, <i>Six2</i>-expressing NPCs are specifically ablated by tamoxifen without inducing the apoptosis of human cells.</p>
<p>In contrast, human cell apoptosis is inevitable in the previously reported system (<a href="#bib9">Yamanaka et al., 2017</a>). This system uses transgenic mice with NPCs expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR), which are specifically ablated by the administration of diphtheria toxin (DT). DT also leads to apoptosis of human cells due to their endogenous expression of active DTR.</p>
<p>By injecting exogenous mouse (allogeneic) or rat (xenogeneic) RPCs into the nephrogenic zone of MNs with the concurrent elimination of host NPCs, the transplanted NPCs in the exogenous RPCs connect to the host UBs and differentiate into mature nephrons <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A).</p>

<p>(A) Immunostaining of a frozen section of metanephroses with ureters and bladder (MNBs) that contain exogenous mouse renal progenitor cells (RPCs) 2 weeks after transplantation (<i>in vivo</i>). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive neo-glomeruli originating from the transplanted RPCs are confirmed. Scale bar, 50 μm.</p>
<p>(B) Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunostaining of a frozen section of MNBs containing exogenous rat RPCs 4 weeks after transplantation (<i>in vivo</i>). Fluorescence microscope analysis revealed that dextran is filtrated by GFP-positive glomerular and tubular structures of neo-nephrons. Scale bar, 500 μm.</p>
<p>(C) According to flow cytometry, 10%–40% of the nephron progenitor cell spheres (NPSs) induced from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are ITGA8+/PDGFRA− pure nephron progenitor cells (NPCs).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to RT-qPCR, the expression of nephron-specific markers of nephrons regenerated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> from rat RPCs was higher than that of rat RPCs before the injections and was comparable with that of age-matched native rat MNs (<a href="#bib2">Fujimoto et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>The regenerated nephrons grow with vasculature supplied by the adult recipients and produce urine <i>in vivo</i>, as confirmed by dextran filtration (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B). We have not evaluated the recovery of kidney function in the recipient animals. However, <i>in vitro</i>, the nephrons do not produce urine without vasculature from the recipients.</p>
<p>According to flow cytometry, ITGA8+/PDGFRA− NPCs represent approximately 10%–40% of all NPSs induced from hiPSCs (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>C).</p>
<p>This NPC replacement system can be applied to NPCs derived from hiPSC <i>in vitro</i>, although they can currently differentiate only into immature renal vesicles (<a href="#bib2">Fujimoto et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>We did not succeed in creating well-organized nephrons from hiPSC-derived NPCs in MNs <i>in vivo</i>; thus, urine production from human-cell-derived neo-nephrons has not been attained.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>We have established a method for the enzymatic dissociation of MNs and the injection of exogenous RPCs below the MN capsule of transgenic mice. However, our method, and especially the RPCs injection, requires practice. Injections by mouth pipetting should be performed gently to avoid rupturing the capsule. Additionally, if RPCs are not injected into the nephrogenic zone, sufficient interaction with the host cap mesenchyme does not occur, leading to insufficient differentiation.</p>
<p>Another limitation lies in the transplantation of MNBs. Transplanted MNBs with RPCs are sometimes lost from the retroperitoneal pocket. RPCs are also easily lost from MNs if the capsule is torn. Furthermore, MNBs transplanted to Lewis rats can be rejected even under immunosuppressive treatment.</p>
<p>Our protocol used organ-specific progenitor cells that have lost pluripotency, avoiding unintended chimeras in the nervous and reproductive systems. We do not have enough long-term data on tumorigenesis because we did not transplant MNs with hiPSC-derived NPCs into adult animals. However, at the examined time-point, no tumor formation from exogenous RPCs was observed.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>MNs are lost or damaged during their extraction from embryos.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>MNs can easily be damaged during the dissection along the vertebral column in the back of embryos. Create shallow slits in the caudal end and deep cuts in the cranial end.</p>
<p>MNs can be peeled together during the removal of the vertebral column. The aorta runs as deep as the MNs, indicating how deep the vertebral column can be peeled.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The rupture of the capsule during RPCs injections leads to a leakage of the injected cells outside the MNs.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, excessively sharp glass needles are inappropriate, as they can easily tear the capsule. Do not polish glass needles during preparation.</p>
<p>Second, completely remove the supernatants from the pellets because moist pellets are released from the needle in large droplets.</p>
<p>Finally, while mouth pipetting, blow through the syringe very gently and in short intervals.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>

<p>First, use PLATINUM PRO glass slides (SPRO-04, Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd.) with a special coating that allows strong adhesion.</p>
<p>Second, before starting the immunostaining, dry the sections with warm air to allow samples to adhere to the glass slides.</p>
