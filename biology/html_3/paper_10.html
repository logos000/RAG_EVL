    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>Thalamus is a critical information relay hub in the cortex; its malfunction causes multiple neurological and
      psychiatric disorders. However, there are no model systems to study the development and function of human
      thalamus. Here, we present a protocol to generate regionally specified human brain organoids that recapitulate the
      development of the thalamus using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Thalamic organoids can be used to study
      human thalamus development, to model related diseases, and to discover potential therapeutics.</p>
    <p>For complete information on human thalamic organoids and their application, please refer to the paper by <a
        href="#bib8">Xiang et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

    <h3>Maintaining Culture of hESCs or hiPSCs</h3>
    <div class="timing">
      <span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 week
    </div>
    <p>hESCs or hiPSCs are cultured under feeder-free condition. Passaging is performed once a week when cells approach
      ~80% confluency.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <span class="note-title">Note:</span> Culturing of hPSCs is established by Yale Human Embryonic Stem Cell Core,
      based on the protocol from Eric Bouhassira’s laboratory to grow human H-1 and H-9 cell lines derived by the James
      Thomson’s lab at Wisconsin, as well as hESC lines from other labs.
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>Thaw 100 µl aliquoted Matrigel on ice. Dilute Matrigel with 6 mL ice-cold DMEM/F-12 medium.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="note">
      <span class="note-title">Note:</span> Note: see below for the calculation of Matrigel volume required for plate
      coating, as suggested by WiCell. 1 mL/X mL = given concentration/1 mg (X = mL of Matrigel aliquoted per tube; 1 mg
      is suggested for use in two 6-well plates).
    </div>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>Add 1 mL of diluted Matrigel to each well of the 6-well tissue culture plate.</li>
      <li>Place the plate in the incubator for 2 h before use. We suggest that the Matrigel-coated plate is used
        directly 2 h after coating. If storage is needed, keep the coated plate at 4°C before use.</li>
      <li>Under the stereomicroscope, scrape off differentiated colonies using a 200 µl pipette tip.</li>
      <li>In the cell culture hood, remove the medium in the well, then add 1 mL DMEM/F-12 medium to each well.
        DMEM/F-12 medium is warmed up to room temperature (22 - 25°C) before use.</li>
      <li>Add 166 µl Dispase (5 U/mL) to each well, return the plate to the incubator, and incubate for 7 min. This time
        period is suitable for different cell lines. At the end of treatment, the edge of the colony should curl up
        while the major of the colony remain attached to the plate.</li>
      <li>Take out the plate, remove the Dispase-containing medium from each well, and wash each well with 2 mL
        DMEM/F-12 medium twice.</li>
      <li>Remove the wash medium, add another 1 mL DMEM/F-12 medium to each well. Scrape down the colonies vertically
        and horizontally with 1 mL general pipette tip.</li>
      <li>Gently mix the cell suspension, and transfer 100 µl colony-containing medium to a 15 mL centrifuge tube.
        Centrifuge for 3 min at 200 × g.</li>
      <li>Remove medium from the tube, and re-suspend the cells with 2 mL mTeSR1 medium. mTeSR1 medium was developed for
        feeder-independent culture of hPSCs (<a href="#bib4">Ludwig et al., 2006a</a>, <a href="#bib5">2006b</a>) and
        has been widely used. mTeSR1 medium is warmed up to room temperature (22 - 25°C) before use.</li>
      <li>Take out the Matrigel-coated plate (prepared in Step 2), remove Matrigel solution, and add the 2 mL cell
        suspension to 1 well of the 6-well tissue culture plate. Note: depending on the scale of the organoid induction
        (or other experiments) to be performed with these cells, the volume of cell suspension and the numbers of plated
        wells can be adjusted.</li>
      <li>Return the plate to incubator. Medium is changed daily (2 mL/well) starting from 48 h after the passaging.
        Unused cells from step 8 can be discarded at this point.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Neural Induction</h3>
    <div class="timing">
      <span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 8 days
    </div>
    <p>When hESCs or hiPSCs approach ~80% confluency, which typically occurs one week after passaging the cells, single
      cell suspension is prepared to perform neural induction.</p>

      <li>Under the stereomicroscope, scrape off any differentiated cells.</li>

    <h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected Outcomes</h2>
    <p>High quality and non-differentiated hPSC colonies are maintained for single cell dissociation. hPSCs being used
      should possess normal karyotype and are free of any form of microbial contamination (e.g., mycoplasma, fungus,
      bacteria et al.).</p>
    <p>Twenty-four h after plating the single cell suspension, a single central embryoid body with smooth surface should
      form (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>), and maintain healthy during neural induction (i.e., a smooth surface, no
      disintegration). Note: as long as a central embryoid body is formed (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, left side), a
      small amount of debris around the embryoid body should be fine. In contrast, a failure to form a central embryoid
      body (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, right side) will lead to failure in organoid development. During thalamic
      patterning, embryoid body should maintain a smooth surface (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>).</p>

    <p>Organoids remain intact and continue growing during further differentiation and maturation (<a
        href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Size increase may stop after two months’ of culturing.</p>
    <p>Organoids will express thalamus-specific markers, and produce a cell diversity in a way similar to human thalamus
      in vivo (<a href="#bib8">Xiang et al., 2019</a>). For a basic confirmation of thalamic induction, qPCR and/or
      immunostaining analysis for representative markers (e.g., caudal forebrain marker OTX2 and thalamic marker DBX1,
      GBX2, as well as TCF7L2) can be detected. In particular, TCF7L2+ cells should be widely distributed in thalamic
      organoids (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). Once the protocol is established for a specific cell line, it is
      expected that thalamic organoid will be produced in each differentiation; thus, marker analysis for thalamic
      organoids is only necessary when working with a new line for the first time.</p>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <p>As stated above, the time required for long-term culture depends on specific experimental purpose thus cannot be
      defined here. For fully functional maturation, long term culturing (e.g., over three months) is required.</p>
    <p>Compared to the human brain organoid representing the cerebral cortex, human thalamic organoids display smaller
      ventricle-like organizations (<a href="#bib8">Xiang et al., 2019</a>). The fundamental difference requires further
      investigation.</p>
    <p>Differentiation efficiency can be cell line-dependent (<a href="#bib3">Lancaster et al., 2017</a>), thus
      optimization may be needed for specific cell lines to be used. Once the optimization is defined, differentiation
      tends to remain consistent given the tight signaling control of the development. We have generated thalamic
      organoids from hESCs (HES-3 NKX2-1<sup>GFP/w</sup> cells and H-1 cells) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell
      (PBMC)-derived hiPSCs. All these cell lines efficiently produce thalamic organoids.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
    <h3>Problem 1: Low Efficiency of Directed Differentiation</h3>
    <h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
    <p>The quality of starting cells should be carefully controlled before differentiation. hESCs or hiPSCs should be
      maintained according to the standard culturing protocol. For alternative protocol of hESCs or hiPSCs culturing,
      refer to WiCell for details (<a
        href="https://www.wicell.org/home/stem-cells/support/stem-cell-protocols/-home-stem-cells-support-stem-cell-protocols-stem-cell-protocols-cmsx-.cmsx">https://www.wicell.org/home/stem-cells/support/stem-cell-protocols/-home-stem-cells-support-stem-cell-protocols-stem-cell-protocols-cmsx-.cmsx</a>).
    </p>
    <p>If cells are cultured under MEF condition, a transition to MEF-free culture condition is needed before using the
      current differentiation protocol.</p>
    <p>Make sure any differentiated colonies is removed before single cell dissociation.</p>
    <p>Make sure any form of microbial contamination is avoided before and throughout the differentiation.</p>
    <p>Make sure all the reagents used are in the correct concentration.</p>
    <h3>Problem 2: Failure in Embryoid Body Growth</h3>
    <h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
    <p>Make sure a single embryoid body is formed 24 h after plating the single cell suspension; otherwise, successful
      organoid development is unlikely.</p>
    <p>Double check the quality of the hESCs or hiPSCs used for differentiation (see problem-1).</p>
    <p>Avoid excessive dissociation by Accutase during single cell preparation.</p>
    <p>Make sure the neural induction medium is correctly prepared.</p>
    <p>As described here and in previous reports, to ensure embryoid body formation, Y-27632 needs to be supplemented
      for the first 4 days of differentiation (<a href="#bib2">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</a>; <a href="#bib6">Xiang
        et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib7">2018</a>, <a href="#bib8">2019</a>). Make sure the correct concentration of
      Y-27632 is used.</p>
    <h3>Problem 3: Disintegration of Brain Organoids Occurs during Differentiation</h3>
    <h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
    <p>Check the presence of any contamination in the culture system (e.g., bacteria, fungus, mycoplasma, et al.).</p>
    <p>Ensure the medium is prepared correctly, and all the chemicals and cytokines supplemented are in the correct
      concentration.</p>
    <p>Make sure not to break the surface of organoids whenever transferring them.</p>
    <p>During thalamic patterning, instead of transferring embryoid bodies to ultra-low attachment 24-well plate, they
      can also be transferred to ultra-low attachment 6-well plate to start the spinning culture. Researchers can choose
      either option according to their preference or specific scale of differentiation.</p>
    <p>Adding dissolved Matrigel (e.g., 1% ~2% [v/v]) may benefit organoid integrity.</p>
    <h3>Problem 4: Failure in Long-Term Development of Organoids</h3>
    <h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
    <p>Extra growth factors (e.g., FGF2 or EGF) are not included in the protocol. These factors, however, may promote
      the development of organoids (<a href="#bib1">Birey et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib9">Yoon et al., 2019</a>). For
      cell lines that display low proliferation rate and poor organoid development, supplementation of growth factors
      such as FGF2, EGF, or both, could be an alternative option.</p>
    <p>For most of the cases, 9000 cells/embryoid body will be an ideal starting point to achieve successful organoid
      differentiation. The optimal cell number required can be cell line-dependent (<a href="#bib1">Lancaster et al.,
        2017</a>), thus desires to be tested if needed.</p>

    <h2 id="q-and-a">Q&amp;A</h2>
    <p class="question"><b>Question (step 12):</b> Why does FBS help in the formation of embryoid body?</p>
    <p class="answer"><b>Answer:</b> For cell lines that couldn’t form EB efficiently with the supplement of Y27632, we
      found adding FBS could help. The exact mechanism remains to be explored, however, it is possible that components
      in FBS may facilitate cell-cell attachment.</p>
    <p class="question"><b>Question (step 14):</b> Is it important to be gentle from this stage forward?</p>
    <p class="answer"><b>Answer:</b> Yes, it is important. When changing medium, try not to disturb the EB at the bottom
      of the well.</p>
    <p class="question"><b>Question (step 1 Neural maturation):</b> Is there a specific reason for 6 organoids per well?
      What happens if I do too many or too few?</p>
    <p class="answer"><b>Answer:</b> Adding more organoids per well won’t affect differentiation. However, the chance
      for organoids to attach to each other will increase if too many organoids are transferred to one well, which needs
      to be avoided.</p>
