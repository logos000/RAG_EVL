<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We have recently demonstrated that the activity of hexokinase 2 is dependent on the intracellular potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) concentration ([K<sup>+</sup>]). To analyze the K<sup>+</sup> dependency of the cell metabolism in cell populations, we used an extracellular flux analyzer to assess oxygen consumption and acidification rates as well-established measures of oxidative- and glycolytic metabolic activities. This protocol describes in detail how a potential K<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of the cell metabolism can be elucidated by extracellular flux analysis.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00582-7/sref2">Bischof et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The workflow described in this protocol takes 2 days with requirements of specific equipment (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>). Before starting the experiments, specified media must be prepared, and a sufficient number of cells, which should be maintained on one 10 cm cell culture dish should be available for cell seeding on day 1. A confluency of 80%–90% can be considered sufficient for conducting the experiments described. The protocol described herein focuses on the analysis of HEK293, HeLa, and INS-1 832/13 cells. However, this protocol has also been tested using established breast cancer cell lines such as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells.</p>
<p>Having identified recently that hexokinase-II (HKII) represents an enzyme depending on K<sup>+</sup> (<a href="#bib2">Bischof et al., 2021</a>), this protocol aims to demonstrate how to unveil potential K<sup>+</sup> sensitive structures/ enzymes in cell metabolic activity and allows to determine the contribution of HKII to the metabolic homeostasis in diverse (primary) cell lines. A strong affection of extracellular acidification rates (ECAR), i.e., glycolytic activity, by intracellular K<sup>+</sup> depletion indicates a significant contribution of HKII for the maintenance of the glycolytic activity in these cells. An additional affection of oxygen consumption rates (OCR), i.e., oxidative phosphorylation, by intracellular K<sup>+</sup> depletion points to a significant contribution of glycolytic substrates to the oxidative phosphorylation activity.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Culture cell lines</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> Day 0</div>
<p>The cells described herein can be handled without the need for special (pre-) treatment. For the cultivation of HEK293 and HeLa cells, DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) was supplemented with 1<b>×</b> Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1<b>×</b> sodium pyruvate, while INS-1 832/13 cells were cultivated in Gibco RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1<b>×</b> sodium pyruvate, 1<b>×</b> Penicillin-Streptomycin. For the cultivation of all cell lines, a humidified incubator adjusted to 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> was used. Cell splitting procedures were adjusted to the cell line specific growth properties and initial seeding density and were carried out when the confluency reached 80%–90%. For cell detachment, Trypsin-EDTA at a final concentration of 0.05% in PBS was used.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Adjust the splitting ratios to the cell lines. For HEK293, HeLa and INS-1 832/13 cells, splitting ratios of 1:6 are recommended. Other cell lines might need to be split into lower or higher ratios to ensure growth and viability. Do not conduct metabolic experiments with cells at very high passages, e.g. above p50. Finally, the aseptic culture conditions should be as consistent as possible with no disturbances in the temperature or CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of the media used for extracellular flux analysis</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> Day 0</div>
<p>To investigate the K<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of cellular metabolism by extracellular flux analysis as well as its putative reversibility, two different media need to be prepared. The first medium contains 0 mM K<sup>+</sup> and is referred to as “Seahorse Medium without K<sup>+</sup> ” (SM-0K<sup>+</sup> ), the second medium contains 140.0 mM K<sup>+</sup> and is referred to as “Seahorse medium-high potassium” (SM-140K<sup>+</sup> ). The formulation of these media can be found in the “<a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>” section below.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Designing the experiment</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> Day 1, 0.5 h</div>
<p>Before plating the cells the experiment needs to be designed using the Seahorse Wave Desktop Software.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start the Seahorse Agilent Wave Desktop Software
<ol type="a">
<li>The software can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.agilent.com/en/products/cell-analysis/software-download-for-wave-desktop">https://www.agilent.com/en/products/cell-analysis/software-download-for-wave-desktop</a>.</li>
<li>Install the software and run the application.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Design the experiment and define groups.
<ol type="a">
<li>Open the “blank” file under the templates section.</li>
<li>Define the conditions of the experiment in the “definitions” section. Start with defining the injection strategies, pretreatments, assay media, and cell type.
<ol type="i">
<li>Injection strategies might be neglected if only basal (no injection) extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) or basal oxygen consumption rates (OCR) are of interest. Depending on the experimental setups, injection strategies might be added.</li>
<li>Define pretreatments, which will additionally comprise the treatment with DMSO as control and Gramicidin (dissolved in DMSO) as the actual experimental condition. Further pretreatments might be added, if necessary.</li>
<li>Define the assay media used, which will comprise SM-0K<sup>+</sup> and SM-140K<sup>+</sup> medium. Further assay media might be added, if necessary.<br> Cell treatment with the pore forming peptide gramicidin allows to adjust the intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration ([K<sup>+</sup>]) to the [K<sup>+</sup>] present in the extracellular space/ medium, i.e., 0 mM K<sup>+</sup> (SM-0K<sup>+</sup>) and 140.0 mM K<sup>+</sup> (SM-140K<sup>+</sup>).</li>
<li>Define the cell type used in the experiments, for example, HEK293, HeLa, and INS-1 832/13.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Define your treatments or manipulations in the “groups” section. Definitions need to be precise and consistent.
<ol type="i">
<li>In the beginning, only a “background” group will be defined, which can neither be altered nor removed, as it is indispensable.</li>
<li>For each condition (12 in this case, comprising HEK293, HeLa, and INS-1 832/13, each treated with SM-0K<sup>+</sup> DMSO, SM-0K<sup>+</sup> GRAM, SM-140K<sup>+</sup> DMSO, and SM-140K<sup>+</sup> GRAM, respectively) add a new group and choose the respective injection strategy, pretreatments, assay media, and cell type. Accurately defining the groups will lead to sorted results after the assay is finished and the results have been exported. The names of the groups can be changed by a right-click on the group header. The “Generate Groups” function in the Seahorse Wave Desktop software can automatically assign the groups, if the pretreatments, assay media and cell types have been correctly defined.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Assign the defined groups to the wells by clicking the group on the left side and clicking the wells comprising the respective groups on the right side. The “distribute groups” button might be used and will fairly spread the groups on the plate. We recommend including at least four blanks on the plate. The software automatically suggests using the 4 edge wells as a background.</li>
<li>Define the protocol that is used for analyzing the cells. If only basal ECAR/OCR ratios are of interest, the measurement of a baseline without injection is sufficient. The protocol might, however, be altered depending on the desired read-out, and injections at different time points might be added. We recommend performing at least 4 measurement cycles.</li>
<li>Once the protocol is defined, it can be saved and re-opened when the measurement is started.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="timing">

<p>The cell number which needs to be seeded into the wells of a Seahorse XF96 Cell Culture Microplate depends on the size of the adherent cells. Typically, for HEK293, HeLa, and INS-1 832/13 cells, 70.000, 50.000, and 100.000 cells, respectively, yield a confluency of ∼90% on the next day, which can be checked by a conventional bright-field microscope. Such confluency is a good starting point for performing the experiments. Typical cell numbers seeded per well of a 24- or 96-well plate can be found in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Performing the experiments and analysis as outlined above will give you the following information:</p>
<p>Do my cells of interest show a gramicidin treatment, i.e., K<sup>+</sup> sensitive, metabolic activity?</p>
<p>Can the potential K<sup>+</sup> sensitive metabolic activity be restored by re-addition of a high [K<sup>+</sup>]?</p>
<p>We have recently demonstrated, that affecting the subcellular K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, also in a gramicidin free manner, significantly modulates cell metabolic activity, as the activation of a voltage-gated potassium channel, K<sub>V</sub>1.3, in HEK293 cells also modulated the glycolytic activity within these cells (<a href="#bib2">Bischof et al., 2021</a>). As cancers are frequently associated with alterations in their K<sup>+</sup> channel expression patterns (<a href="#bib4">Huang and Jan, 2014</a>), and the presence of such channels drives cancer malignancy, mostly, however, by unknown means (<a href="#bib3">Felipe et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib6">Mohr et al., 2019</a>, <a href="#bib7">Mohr et al., 2020</a>), a K<sup>+</sup> stimulated metabolic activity might link the alterations in K<sup>+</sup> channel expression patterns with tumor progression. Whether K<sup>+</sup> channels can directly drive cancer cell proliferation by stimulating HKII dependent glycolysis remains, however, elusive. Nevertheless, based on recent results of a K<sup>+</sup> dependent HKII activity, specifically addressing K<sup>+</sup> channels in cancer cells may affect their metabolic activity and, hence, proliferative activity. Interestingly, besides our report of HKII representing a metabolic, K<sup>+</sup> dependent enzyme, earlier reports also demonstrated a K<sup>+</sup> dependency of, for example, the pyruvate kinase (<a href="#bib5">Kachmar and Boyer, 1953</a>). Consequently, whether targeting the intracellular K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis represents feasible 1) to target cancer cell proliferation and 2) to specifically affect (cancer) cell metabolism by targeting HKII or also via modulating the activity of other enzymes remains elusive but might be aim of future studies.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>Data can be represented and analyzed using any program of choice. We recommend using and plotting every single technical replicate for analysis. Experiments should, however, at least be replicated for a minimum of 3 times on 3 independent days to ensure data consistency and reproducibility.</p>
<p>We recommend testing the data for normal distribution to choose the proper statistical test. Usually, an Unpaired t-test (if data are normally distributed) or a Mann-Whitney-U test (if data are not normally distributed) should be used for pairwise comparison of SM-0K<sup>+</sup> DMSO vs. SM-0K<sup>+</sup> gramicidin and SM-140K<sup>+</sup> DMSO vs. SM-140K<sup>+</sup> gramicidin.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>First, if cells are very resistant to gramicidin treatment, it may be difficult to permeabilize them for K<sup>+</sup>. To ensure the gramicidin sensitivity of cells, it may hence be helpful to conduct intracellular measurements of K<sup>+</sup> using, for example, recently developed, genetically encoded K<sup>+</sup> indicators, the GEPIIs (<a href="#bib1">Bischof et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<p>Second, if cells show no adherence and grow in suspension, the protocol may become more difficult and more laborious. In this case, pre-coating of the wells, e.g., with Cell-Tak or Poly-L-Lysine may be helpful.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The number of cells listed in this protocol does not work as cells are either too confluent (&gt;95%) or show too low density under the microscope (&lt;80%) (step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Adjust the cell number based on your observations. If cell density seemed to low increase the number of seeded cells and vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>No ECAR or OCR values are detected by the Seahorse XF96 Analyzer (step 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Be more careful during the cell preparation as cells may have detached during repeated washing. Alternatively, wells may be coated Cell-Tak cell and tissue adhesive to increase cell adherence. Therefore, 2.5 mL of a 22.4 μg/mL of Cell-Tak in PBS solution are prepared and each well of the Seahorse XFe 96-well cell culture plate is incubated with 25 μL of the solution at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 20 min prior to cell seeding. Please also see <a href="https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/technicaloverviews/public/5991-7153EN.pdf">https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/technicaloverviews/public/5991-7153EN.pdf</a></p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Seahorse raw data show a large variability from well to well (step 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Make sure that cell suspension is homogeneous when cells are seeded. Additionally, be more careful during the cell preparation as cells in single wells may have detached during repeated washing. Alternatively, wells may be coated Cell-Tak cell and tissue adhesive to increase cell adherence.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Cells look fine prior to starting the experiment when observing under the microscope. When measurement is started, however, no ECAR or OCR is detected (step 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Cell treatment with gramicidin +/- K<sup>+</sup> might be too harsh. Try to adjust the gramicidin concentration by gradually lowering. Additionally, try other [K<sup>+</sup>] as 0 or 140.0 mM of K<sup>+</sup> might be too harsh.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The baseline during the measurement is not stable but increases or decreases initially or continuously (step 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Baselines that are unstable at the beginning but equilibrate after 2 or 3 measurement cycles frequently indicate bad/ too short equilibration phases of the cells in the seahorse media. If baseline continuously declines, cell detachment/ death might be the reason. Try to shorten gramicidin incubation times under these conditions, in order to keep cell-stress as short as possible.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Seahorse raw data look fine, but upon normalization for the protein concentration data starts to scatter (step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Large deviations and scattering data may be caused by problems with the method of normalization, as either the determination of the protein concentration was wrong (if data were normalized for protein concentration) or cells have detached upon washing (if data were normalized for cell number). In both cases, try to normalize for another parameter.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>Results show low reproducibility from day to day (step 19).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Try to keep as many parameters as possible constant including cell seeding and cultivation conditions, volumes, solvents and incubation times. Make sure that cells are not in a too high passage and do not use cells directly after thawing – cultivate cells for at least 3 passages prior to performing the experiments. Also check all media for potential contamination. Ensure to mix the gramicidin containing seahorse media well, as gramicidin is initially precipitating in aqueous solutions.</p>
