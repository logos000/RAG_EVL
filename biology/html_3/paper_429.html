<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Cells produce two broad classes of extracellular vesicles (EVs), exosomes and microvesicles (MVs). Exosomes are 30–150 nm vesicles derived from multivesicular bodies, while MVs are 200–1,000 nm vesicles that pinch off from plasma membranes. Reliable isolation of EVs is crucial to understand their biochemical and functional properties. Here, we describe a protocol to isolate and characterize EVs from conditioned medium from mammalian cell lines. This protocol has been optimized for adherent cells but can also be adapted for suspension cells.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib4">Latifkar et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 h for plating cells; 72 h of culturing cells prior to EV isolation</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The EV isolation protocol described here has been optimized for adherent cells, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells will be used as an example. However, the procedure can also be adapted for cells that grow in suspension (<a href="#bib7">Zhang et al., 2019</a>).</div>
<ol>
<li>Plate cells in two 150-mm tissue culture dishes, such that they will be ∼80% confluent in 72 h. For MDA-MB-231 cells, 2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells are plated in each of the dishes containing growth media (RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum; FBS).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Expression plasmids, siRNAs and shRNAs can be introduced into the cells via transfection or viral infection 24 h after plating the cells (<a href="#bib4">Latifkar et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib1">Antonyak et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib2">Desroches et al., 2016</a>).</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> To ensure that sufficient amounts of exosomes and/or MVs are collected for subsequent analyses, it is recommended that at least two-150 mm dishes of nearly confluent (∼80%) cells be used as a starting point. This amount can be scaled up or down to meet experimental needs.</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of reagents</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–2 h, reagents can be prepared prior to the day of the procedure</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Filter sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice with a 0.22 μm filter unit, 200 mL, store at 4°C.</li>
<li>Lysis buffer, 10 mL, store at 4°C.</li>
<li>Wash ultracentrifuge tubes and their lids thoroughly with sterile deionized and distilled water. Fill the ultracentrifuge tubes with 70% ethanol. Place their lids on, and occasionally invert them. Approximately 15 min later, move the tubes to a tissue culture hood (sterile environment) and remove the 70% ethanol. Allow the tubes and lids to dry completely.</li>
<li>Pre-cool a Type 45 Ti fixed-angle rotor at 4°C.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If the isolated EVs are going to be used for RNA analyses, nuclease-free water can be used for preparing reagents and washing and sterilizing the ultracentrifuge tubes/lids.</div>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This protocol is modified from (<a href="#bib4">Latifkar et al., 2019</a>).</div>
<h3 id="sec3.1">Serum starve cells: day 1</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min per experimental condition to exchange the growth medium with serum-free medium (i.e., serum starve two 150-mm tissue culture dishes of cells); 6–14 h of serum starvation to generate the conditioned medium</div>
<p>Culturing cells in medium devoid of serum is critical for the isolation of EVs produced by a given cell type. FBS and calf serum (CS) contain large amounts of vesicles that, if not removed from the culturing medium, will be present together with the EVs isolated from cells.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Caution: All steps described in this section must be carried out in a biosafety cabinet under sterile conditions.</div>
<ol>
<li>Aspirate the serum-containing (i.e., growth) medium from two nearly confluent 150 mm plates of cells and rinse them with 15 mL of sterile, 37°C PBS per dish.
<ol type="a">
<li>Aspirate the PBS.</li>
<li>Repeat the rinse step two additional times.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Serum-free medium can also be used for the wash steps.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Rinse each plate of cells with 10 mL of serum-free medium that had been warmed to 37°C. For MDA-MB-231 cells this is RPMI-1640 medium.
<ol type="a">
<li>Aspirate the medium from the cells.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> All rinsing steps should be performed gently, as to not cause cell detachment.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add 20–22 mL of serum-free RPMI-1640 medium that was warmed to 37°C into each 150 mm dish of cells and culture them in a cell incubator (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for a minimum of 6 h to as long as 14 h. We suggest a minimum of 6 h of serum starvation be used, so that the cells release enough EVs for isolation purposes. Longer duration of serum starvation can result in better EV yields.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The length of serum starvation used to generate the conditioned medium can vary depending on how sensitive the cells being used are to dying when deprived of nutrients (i.e., serum starved). It is important to make certain that the serum-starved cells are still viable when collecting the conditioned medium (see below), as fragments of dead cells can contaminate the MV and exosome preparations.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.2">Collecting conditioned medium and cell lysis: day 2</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–1.5 h</div>
<p>The conditioned medium is collected from cells and placed in 50 mL conical tubes. The samples are subjected to low speed centrifugation to remove intact cells and cell debris from the conditioned medium. At this point, the partially clarified medium contains soluble factors (i.e., growth factors), MVs, and exosomes.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The transfer of medium between tubes (i.e., conical and ultracentrifuge tubes) must be carried out in a sterile tissue culture hood. All centrifugation steps should be performed at 4°C. The reagents and collected samples need to be maintained on ice.</div>
<ol start="4">
<li>The conditioned medium from two-150 mm dishes of serum-starved cells is collected and placed in sterile 50 mL conical tubes on ice.</li>
<li>Treat the cells with trypsin to detach them from the plate. The cells are subsequently counted and lysed.
<ol type="a">
<li>Trypsin treat the cells by adding 5 mL of trypsin to each 150 mm plate of cells. Once the cells have completely detached from the plate, add 5 mL of growth medium (serum-containing medium) to inactivate the trypsin. The cells are pipetted up and down repeatedly until a single-cell suspension is achieved. The cells are then transferred to a 15 mL conical tube.</li>
<li>Determine the number of cells present in the solution using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the cells at 500 × <i>g</i> at 4°C for 5 min to pellet the cells.</li>
<li>Rinse the cell pellet with 5 mL of ice cold PBS.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the cells at 500 × <i>g</i> at 4°C for 5 min to pellet the cells and remove the PBS.</li>
<li>Lyse the cells using 2.0 mL of ice cold lysis buffer and pipet the cells up and down several times. As our lysis buffer contains 1% Triton X-100, it effectively disrupts cell and EV membranes. Thus, there is no need for sonication. Transfer the lysate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.</li>
<li>Incubate the samples on ice for 15 min.</li>
<li>Centrifuge the samples at 16,000 × <i>g</i> for 10 min and place the clarified cell lysate in a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice for use later.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This is considered to be the whole cell lysate (WCL).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Determining the number of cells from which the conditioned medium was derived is important because it allows for the determination of the numbers of EVs that are produced per cell when performing Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) (see below).</div>

<li>Steps 6 and 7 are repeated.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> When removing the supernatant from the centrifuged conditioned medium, it is important to leave a small volume (i.e., ∼1 mL) behind, to avoid disrupting the pellet.</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–2 h, depending on the number of samples</div>
<p>In this step of the procedure, filtration is performed to isolate the large EVs (i.e., the MVs) from the partially clarified medium.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Here, a detailed protocol for the isolation and characterization of the two major classes of EVs (i.e., MVs and exosomes) produced by cells is provided. EVs isolated from two 150 mm dishes of MDA-MB-231 cells (i.e., ∼4.0 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells) using this approach typically yields approximately 15–20 μg of MV lysate and 40–50 μg of exosome lysate, which is sufficient to run several western blots, perform proteomics, and carry-out biological assays. <a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a> and <a href="#fig7">7</a> show examples of immunoblots performed on whole cell lysate (WCL), exosomes lysate (EXO), and MV lysate (MV) probed with various antibodies (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>), as well as example of NTA performed on the partially clarified conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 cells (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) has recently updated their guidelines for characterizing the different classes of EVs, and it is an excellent source of additional information (<a href="#bib5">Théry et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>There is a growing appreciation that there are likely to be multiple subclasses of MVs and exosomes that contain distinct cargo and have unique functions (<a href="#bib6">Willms et al., 2016</a>). Performing sucrose gradient centrifugation, or an iodixanol density gradient fractionation, on isolated MVs and exosomes may help to resolve the subclasses further. The MVs and exosomes isolated and resuspended in PBS can be loaded at the bottom a discontinuous sucrose (0.4–2.5 M) or iodixanol (12%–36%) gradient with decreasing concentration. The sample is subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × <i>g</i>) for 15 h, which will produce 10–12 different fractions, that can be collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis using different markers of interest (<a href="#bib3">Jeppesen et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib6">Willms et al., 2016</a>).</p>
<p>A limitation of this protocol is that it has been optimized for adherent cells. To isolate MVs and exosomes from cells that grown in suspension, the conditioned medium needs to be initially cleared of all cells and debris. This is accomplished using the two low speed spins (1,000 × <i>g</i>, 5 min). Extra centrifugation steps are also required to pellet the cells for serum starvation.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Low yields of MVs and exosomes.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The number of cells used for EV isolation can be scaled up. Although it is generally accepted that all cells generate EVs, the amounts of MVs and exosomes that different cell types produce can vary greatly.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>MV yields are low.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the amount of MVs isolated is lower than expected (but the exosome yields are sufficient), it is likely that their resuspension from the filter is incomplete (see step 15). Make sure to thoroughly rinse the filter with lysis buffer or PBS by pipetting the solution over the entire filter at least 20 times.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>MV yields are low and MV markers are detected in the exosome preparations.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If MV yields are low and the exosome lysates contain MV markers (i.e., annexin), the strength of the vacuum applied to the 0.22 μm filter in step 10 of the protocol may be too strong. MVs (and exosomes) are lipid-enclosed packages and can pass through a small pore size if the vacuum pressure is strong.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The filter unit becomes clogged.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Cells and debris in the conditioned medium can cause the 0.22 μm filter unit to become clogged. Make sure that all of the cells and debris have been removed from the conditioned medium using two low speed (1,000 × <i>g</i>, 5 min) spins. Removing the supernatant immediately following each spin and ensuring any unnecessary movements are avoided will help reduce contaminants in the medium.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Cannot visualize the exosome pellet following ultracentrifugation of the conditioned medium.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Avoid unnecessary movements of the ultracentrifuge tubes following centrifugation. Use the mark made on the side of the tube to indicate the location of the exosome pellet, and aspirate the medium from the opposite side of the tube (as to not disrupt the pellet).</p>
