<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Cortical electroencephalography (EEG) is generally used to detect the different sleep-wake states of animals. EEG combined with <i>in vivo</i> multichannel recording provides a powerful tool for decoding the neural network of sleep-wake regulation. Here, we detail a protocol using cortical EEG combined with <i>in vivo</i> multichannel recording to examine the activity of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons in free-moving mice at different sleep-wake stages. The procedures for electrode fabrication, the surgery to implant electrodes, and post-recording data analysis are also included.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00687-0/sref4">Liang et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Animal</h3>
<p>C57BL/6N mice were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Company. The mice were housed at a controlled temperature (22 ± 2°C) and humidity (60%–80%) under a 12 h light-dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 and off at 19:00) and provided free access to food and water. Adult male mice (6–8 weeks old) were used in the experiments. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines for animals used in biological studies of Tongji University and were approved by the Animal Study Committee at Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.</p>

<p>Micro-wire array electrodes play an important role in multi-site, multiple single-unit <i>in vivo</i> recording experiments (<a href="#bib8">Nicolelis et al., 2003</a>). Although they can be purchased from commercial vendors and are reliable for many experiments, it is worthwhile to consider home-made electrodes for economic reasons, as well as for the flexibility of experimental design (<a href="#bib11">Tsai and Yen, 2003</a>).</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 h</div>
<p>For <i>in vivo</i> multichannel electrophysiological recordings of LC neuronal activity during the spontaneous sleep-wake cycle, electrode bundles are implanted into the target nucleus through strict and meticulous operation, and the collector of cortical EEG-EMG signal is implanted (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) (<a href="#bib9">Ren et al., 2018</a>).</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 2. The surgical procedure for implanting electrodes</div>
<p>(A) Adult mice were anaesthetized, the head was fixed in a stereotaxic frame, and the hair on the head of the mouse was removed.</p>
<p>(B) Two skull screws were inserted in the frontal skull for EEG recording, and two others were placed in the skull of the lateral parietal region for grounding. The skull was leveled using a stereotaxic frame, and the location of the target nucleus was marked. Scaling bar: 5 mm.</p>
<p>(C) The electrode bundle of the homemade multichannel electrode was slowly inserted into a hole at the targeted location on the skull.</p>
<p>(D) The electrode bundle was secured by dental cement.</p>
<p>(E) Two EEG wires were soldered to two skull screws in the frontal region for EEG recording, and two ground wires were soldered to two other screws for grounding.</p>
<p>(F) A large spherical solder was soldered at the terminals of the EMG wires.</p>
<p>(G) Two EMG wires were inserted into the neck muscles, and the skin was sutured.</p>
<p>(H) Dental cement was used to secure the exposed skull and electrode.</p>
<p>(I) The mouse was recovered after surgery.</p>

<li>Sterilize the surgical scissors, hemostatic forceps, stainless skull screws and other surgical instruments by autoclaving before the operation. Spray alcohol on the operating tables, stereotaxic frame, and electrode bundles for disinfection. Use the iodophor to disinfect the scalp of mice with hair removed. Wear gloves and masks during the operation, and strictly implement aseptic operation to alleviate the pain of mice as far as possible.</li>
<li>Anesthetize an adult mouse with 1% sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and place it on a stereotaxic frame. Remove the hair on the head of the mouse, and fix the head of the mouse by an adaptor of a stereotaxic frame (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>A).</li>
<li>Cut the mouse scalp to expose the skull, insert two stainless skull screws into the frontal region, and place two others in the lateral parietal region.</li>
<li>Adjust the skull plane to ensure that the bregma and lambda are at a horizontal level on the stereotaxic apparatus.</li>
<li>Calculate and mark the location of the target nucleus (LC: AP = −6.00 mm; ML = ± 0.95 mm) on the skull according to the mouse atlas by Paxinos and Watson (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>B).</li>
<li>Move an electrode over the target brain region, and drill a hole at the desired location on the skull. To verify the location of the implant at the end of the experiment, the electrode tips are dipped in fluorescent Neuro-Dil dye (dissolve at 1–2 mM in vegetable oil by heating to 55°C) prior to surgery insertion, which can then reveal the electrode track under a fluorescent microscope.</li>
<li>Remove the dura of the hole carefully, and insert the electrode bundle slowly into the brain tissue (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>C) (<a href="#bib6">Ma et al., 2013</a>).</li>
<li>Secure the electrode bundle on the skull using 3M Vetbond tissue glue and dental cement sequentially (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>D).</li>
<li>Solder two insulated silver EEG wires to two screws in the frontal skull, and solder two ground wires to two other screws in the lateral parietal skull respectively (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>E).</li>
<li>Insert two EMG electrodes into the neck muscles, and suture the neck skin (<a href="#fig2">Figures 2</a>F and G).</li>
<li>Fix the electrode finally to the skull with more dental cement (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>H).</li>

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Soldering of insulating silver wire and stainless-steel screw as quickly as possible to prevent brain damage caused by high temperature. Skull screws for EEG recording should not contact the scalp to avoid recording the heartbeat of mice.

<p>A multichannel electrode recording technique is used to detect the discharges of neurons in the LC and combined with EEG-EMG recording to determine the activity of LC neurons in different brain states. Firstly, we evaluate recording quality and success probability of LC unit recording by multichannel electrode. The result show that 52.1% of the channels can be successfully recorded to the LC unit, and 8.3% of the successful channels are single electrode recording two LC units at the same time (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). We also count the amplitude and waveform width of LC unit spike (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). Then, we detect the electrode implantation site in the LC, and mice with inaccurate locations are discarded (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>A). The results show that LC neurons exhibit a higher firing rate during wakefulness than during NREM and REM sleep. However, we do not find differences in the mean firing rates of LC neurons between NREM and REM sleep (<a href="#fig8">Figures 8</a>B and 8C) and analyze the possible reasons (<a href="#bib4">Liang et al., 2021</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>First, our homemade multichannel electrodes have only 12 channels to record neuronal spikes, and the number of neurons recorded per mouse is limited, which may increase the time cost and the number of animals to complete the experiment. In addition, compared with microdrive array electrodes, our electrodes are unable to be adjusted, so we cannot record the discharges of neurons in different layers of the nucleus in one experiment. Finally, for very small nucleus recording, our electrode bundle may be too large to exclude the possibility of recording neurons outside; hence, this electrode bundle may not as favorable as silicon electrodes.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1: Noise in the neural recordings</h3>
<p>Neural recordings may display high amounts of electrical noise and a low signal-to-noise ratio (step 13).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are several methods for reducing electrical noise and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. First, we ensure that the neural recording system is grounded. Normally, the ground wire of the recording system is connected with the shielding box, and the shielding box is grounded. Then, the recording system is separated from other electrical devices to avoid 50 Hz power-frequency interference. In addition, during the surgery, we ensure that the electrode is well grounded on the skull screw, mainly by checking whether the soldering is firm and whether the ground wire is conductive. Finally, lowering the electrode very slowly during surgery is also important for obtaining high-quality recordings.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2: Noise in the LFP recordings</h3>
<p>LFP signals are not a simple EEG-EMG signal and cannot reflect the sleep-wake state (step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>First, the skull screw and silver wire of EEG recordings do not touch the scalp of mice during the surgery, and the skull screw is fixed as far as possible from the blood vessels to prevent the recording of vascular pulsation or heartbeat. Then, insulated ground, EEG and EMG wires should be used, and separate the EEG wires from other wires and skull screws to avoid short circuits. When the recording of EMG signals is not obvious or fails, make sure that the EMG wires are indeed placed into the neck muscle of mice during the surgery, and fix the EMG wire with tissue glue and suture, which can prevent any potential movement of the wires in the neck muscle while the mouse moves. Moreover, a large spherical solder can be soldered at the terminals of the EMG wire to increase the contact area with the neck muscles and improve the recording of EMG (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>F).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3: Difficulties in sorting neural activity</h3>
<p>It is difficult to remove noise and sort different neuronal spikes during sorting neural activity to obtain a high-quality spike signal (step 23, 24).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>When the recorded file is large and there may be considerable noise, we can use low-cut filtering primarily to remove signals of lower than 250 Hz or 300 Hz. Offline Sorter provides an automated principal component analysis that clusters the waveforms. It is easier to cluster when the noise and signals are separate; however, it usually takes a longer time to cluster and manually sorter when the noise is fully integrated into the signals.</p>
<p>Neuronal clusters should be well isolated and easy to differentiate when we use different 2D cluster views; however, if some parts are mixed together and cannot be separated automatically in one 2D cluster view, we should try to use different 2D cluster views or 3D cluster views (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>To obtain high-quality data, theoretically, all time intervals of discharge (interspike interval, ISI) of a single neuron should not be shorter than the refractory period (1–2 ms) of the neuron (<a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>). However, in practice, a pollution rate of 0.5%–1% is generally allowed; that is, the proportion of ISI with a duration less than the refractory period should not exceed 1% of all ISI (<a href="#bib2">Lewicki, 1998</a>; <a href="#bib10">Takekawa et al., 2010</a>). Note that when removing noise, do not remove it in stages, but select it together throughout the recording period, so that even if the noise removal is not very clean, it is evenly distributed throughout the recording period and will not be biased.</p>

<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4: No spike of neurons can be recorded.</h3>
<p>There are three conditions,</p>
<p>Case 1, the spikes are obscured in the excessive noise (step 13, 14). Case 2, problems with the animal, such as poor electrode quality, the electrode is not firmly implanted, and so on (Fabrication of the electrodes, step 1 and the surgery of implanting electrodes step 8). Case 3, problems with the recording system, such as poor contact of recording system, and so on (step 13).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The solution to noise in case 1 can be found in the section of troubleshooting “<a href="#sec6.1">problem 1</a>”. For case 2 &amp; 3, an emulator can be used instead of the mouse to troubleshoot the problem. If the data acquisition system is connected to the emulator and the simulation waveform can be recorded, that means there are problems of animal side, and replace other mice to record it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if the acquisition device is connected to the emulator, the simulator waveform cannot be recorded, that means there are problems of system side, and carefully check the circuit connection, such as headstage and other interfaces. And whether the record computer is set up correctly.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5: Surgical risk</h3>
<p>Due to the complexity of implanting recording electrodes, improper operation is likely to cause poor recovery or even death of mice, resulting in unnecessary sacrifice of mice and waste of materials and time (step 2, 3, 7, 9, 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Select adult mice in good health. Use the safer isoflurane anesthetic system as far as possible, monitor the body temperature of mice in real time, and use electric blanket throughout the whole process if necessary. If conditions permit, aseptic operation should be ensured during surgery, including skin disinfection of mice and autoclaving of surgical instruments. Prepare gelatin sponges for possible bleeding during surgery. The implanted screws should not be too deep (approximately 1 mm) to prevent damage to cortical tissue and cause hemiplegia in mice. Implanting electrode slowly (100 um/s) to reduce brain tissue damage. Practice welding technology in advance to avoid high temperature damage to mice. After surgery, appropriate antibiotics are injected to prevent infection. After recovering from consciousness on the electric blanket, the animals were raised in a single cage.</p>
