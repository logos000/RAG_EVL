<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The hypothalamic magnocellular neuroendocrine cells (MNCs) project to the posterior pituitary (PPi), regulating reproduction and fluid homeostasis. It has been challenging to selectively label and manipulate MNCs, as they are intermingled with parvocellular neuroendocrine cells projecting to the median eminence. Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol for specifically targeting the MNCs by infusing retrograde viral tracers into the PPi. When combined with optogenetics, chemogenetics, and transgenic animals, this approach allows cell-type-specific manipulation of MNCs in multiple sites for functional dissection.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00493-7/sref7">Zhang et al. (2021)</a> and <a href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00493-7/sref4">Tang et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This approach is mainly based on the well-established stereotaxic injection in neuroscience research to deliver drugs or viruses into targeted rodent brain areas (<a href="#bib1">Cetin et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#bib6">Xiong and Gendelman, 2013</a>). We adopted common stereotaxic injection and made several optimizations to specifically target the hypothalamic magnocellular neuroendocrine cells (MNCs), especially in rats, aiming to assist the neuroendocrine research. Although widely distributed in the hypothalamus and mixed up with the parvocellular neuroendocrine cells (PNCs) in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), all MNCs share a unique feature of sending axons to the posterior pituitary (PPi). Therefore, infusion of the retrogradely-transported viral tracers (<a href="#bib5">Tervo et al., 2016</a>) into the PPi provides an excellent way to selectively label and target MNCs.</p>
<p>To perform PPi stereotaxic infusion, a stereotaxic instrument (RWD), a pressure microinjector (KdScientific), a 2.5 μL syringe (Hamilton), and surgical tools are essential requirements.</p>
<p>This protocol below is followed to label the ensemble of MNCs in adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats; however, we have also tested it in C57BL/6 mice with minor adjustments.</p>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The procedure follows the animal surgery guidelines, including minimizing the pain by appropriate anesthetization and preventing possible infection by surgical sterility and post-surgical application of antibiotics. To avoid possible infection and viral leakage, the surgery was operated under sterile conditions inside a biological safety cabinet (The Baker company) equipped in a negative-pressure room.</div>

<h3 id="sec2.1">Induction of anesthesia and fixation of animal in stereotaxic instruments</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 15 min</div>
<p>This step helps the transition from awake state to deep anesthesia in the rats, which makes it easy to fix the rat and reduce pain during the surgery.</p>
<ol>
<li>Intraperitoneally (i.p) inject appropriate volume of anesthetics (for adult male SD rats, 5–6 mL/kg body weight is recommended, e.g., 1.5 mL 1% pentobarbital for a 260 g male SD rat, aged 12 weeks) into the rat and put it back to the homecage, wait 5–10 min and check the responsiveness of the rat to nociceptive stimuli (e.g., a pinch of the paw) to make sure that it is in deep anesthesia state. See <a href="#sec5.1">troubleshooting 1</a>.</li>
<li>Trim the fur on the head with scissors and disinfect the skin with three rounds application of iodophor disinfectant followed by 75% ethanol.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The iodophor disinfectant is stable at RT for up to 1 year.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Place the rat on the stereotaxis instruments (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).

<ol type="a">
<li>First, tuck the ear bars into the ear canals loosely but stably.</li>
<li>Second, gently move the ear bars toward the center symmetrically.</li>
<li>Third, fit the up incisors into the tooth bar and slightly tighten the nose clamp.</li>
<li>Finally, apply eye ointment to protect its eyes from strong illumination of the cold light source as well as to prevent eye dryness.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Move the ear bars gently to avoid any damages to the skull. The criteria for successful fixation are that the rat head is horizontal to the base plate and vertical to the ear bars, with free up-down rotation while no medial-lateral or front-back movements allowed.</div>
<h3 id="sec2.2">Craniotomy and determination of skull marks</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 5 min</div>
<p>This step exposes skull marks, including the Bregma and the Lambda, which act as reference points to target the PPi.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>In order to expose the skull, cut the scalp from the middle of the eyes straight backwards to make a 10 mm incision.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The scalp incision might lead to bleeding. When bleeding happens, press the wound with wet cotton for 1–2 min to stop bleeding. Otherwise, skull marks will hardly be visible and the rat can be weak as a result of blood loss. After the stanch, keep the skull moist with sterilized 0.9% saline throughout the surgery.</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Clean the exposed skull with sterilized 0.9% saline-immersed cotton swabs, followed by dry cotton swabs to display the Bregma and the Lambda clearly.
<ol type="a">
<li>The Bregma is the cross point of the sagittal suture and the coronal suture.</li>
<li>The Lambda is the midpoint of the lambdoid suture’s best-fit curve, usually the cross point of the sagittal suture and the extending tangent line of lambdoid suture.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Measure the AP, ML, and DV coordinates of the Bregma and the Lambda with a dissecting microscope (<a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a>A and 4B). Adjust the tooth bar so that the AP axis and ML axis of the skull were both horizontal to the plate of the stereotaxic instruments.

<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Since the position of the pituitary can be changed during dissection, the PPi coordinates provided by the most commonly used brain atlas are not precise enough (<a href="#bib2">Paxinos and Watson, 2006</a>; <a href="#bib3">Swanson, 2004</a>). Based on the atlas, we modified and optimized the coordinates of the PPi specifically for SD rats weighing about 260 g, which is (AP, −5.80 mm; ML, 0 mm; DV, −10.20 mm). For those weighing 220–300 g, the coordinates need further adjustment. The AP and DV coordinates vary in the range of −5.40 – −6.00 mm and −9.50 – −10.50 mm, respectively. To reduce the risk of sagittal suture damage, we usually adjust the ML coordinate to +0.05 – +0.10 mm, which means the needle tip is 50–100 μm left to the skull midline. See <a href="#sec5.3">troubleshooting 2</a> and <a href="#sec5.5">3</a>.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Typically, it takes at least 2 weeks for the virus to be expressed in the soma. We recommend 4 weeks to allow full expression of AAV-Retro-GFP in the soma and fibers. The epifluorescence of the endogenous GFP is strong enough to visualize the signal, there is no need for immunohistochemical staining. After cryostat section, intense epifluorescence (e.g., GFP) can be observed in the nerve terminals within the PPi, fibers in the stalk, and somas in the PVN, supraoptic nucleus (SON), and other magnocellular neuroendocrine nuclei in the hypothalamus.</p>
<p>Previously, the stereotaxic injection has been reported as an approach to deliver genes into the rodent brain (<a href="#bib1">Cetin et al., 2006</a>). We adopted the protocol with specific adjustments to efficiently target the PPi in SD rats and labeled approximately 60% of MNC ensemble in various nuclei within the hypothalamus. Originally, we infused AAV-Retro-GFP to perform morphological analysis (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). It is suitable for functional manipulation if optogenetic or chemogenetic elements, e.g., ChR2, DREADDs, are carried by the virus and exclusively introduced into the MNCs via PPi infusion.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Since the PPi is located at the bottom of the brain and it takes a long distance for the needle to reach it, precautions should be taken against potential contaminations on route during needle insertion. One should scrutinize the regions adjacent to the needle track including the arcuate nucleus (ARC), in which GFP<sup>+</sup> somas should not be found. Samples with possible needle track contamination must be excluded. Only those with no contamination can be used for subsequent analyses, which might increase the total usage amount of the animals.</p>
<p>The PPi coordinates above are specifically tested in male SD rats weighing 250–280 g. For rats beyond this weight range, coordinates must be adjusted. Due to the small size of the PPi, it is more challenging to perform the injection in mice, which needs more optimization.</p>
<p>Regarding the loss-of-function analysis, the label efficiency of 60% might not be high enough. Higher-titer viral preparation might help improve the efficiency, however, the viral toxicity is another concern.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The pentobarbital treatment does not fully anesthetize the rats (step 1).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>During the maintenance of anesthesia, inhaled anesthetics such as the isoflurane are recommended, which provide rapid and reliable control of anesthesia depth and duration without reducing the survivability. Examine the respiratory rate and pattern carefully. Commonly, there should be a slow drop of respiratory and heart rate during appropriate anesthesia. When tachypnea and tachycardia occurred, apply paw pinch to check whether the anesthesia level is inadequate. If it happens, increase the oxygen flow rate or the isoflurane dose. Alternatively, in absence of an isoflurane vaporizer, one might i.p administrate additional 0.1 mL 1% pentobarbital solution to the rat. At the same time, monitor the state of the rats to avoid excessive depression of respiratory and cardiac functions due to over-anesthesia.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Epifluorescence is found in the intermediate lobe (IL) of the pituitary gland besides the PPi (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The epifluorescence in the IL might not be a major concern, if no retrogradely labeled neurons were seen in the ARC, considering that there are few neural fibers in the IL. When it happens, we recommend adjusting the DV coordinate up by about 200 μm. Since the thickness of the PPi and the IL is approximately 700 μm and 200 μm, on a midline sagittal section, respectively, lifting the syringe upwards by 200–500 μm is safe to maintain the needle tip in the PPi.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Blood is pouring when the needle is inserted into the brain (step 8).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The bleeding is probably due to the damage of the sagittal sinus underneath the midline skull, which can even lead to the death of the rat. Drilling a hole 50–100 μm lateral to the midline helps to reduce the risk of bleeding by avoiding damage to the sagittal sinus. The PPi can still be accurately targeted even if the hole is 200 μm lateral.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Retrogradely labeled cells are found outside the hypothalamus or even in the forebrain and the midbrain (step 14).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Different from Problem 2, the extrahypothalamic neurons that are labeled by the AAV-Retro-GFP probably originate from the viral leakage along the needle track. To target the PPi, the needle has to go through various nuclei including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which is a hotspot innervated by multiple brain areas ranging from the forebrain to the midbrain. The ectopically labeled cells can be resulted from the contaminant adjacent to the needle track. To avoid this problem, the outer wall of the needle must be thoroughly cleaned after viral loading. Check the regions around the needle track carefully for every sample with or without extrahypothalamic cells being labeled.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The tracing efficiency is lower than 40% (step 17).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>High titer virus, e.g., 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg/mL, is recommended for rat injection. Avoid frequent freeze-thaw cycles. Do not make a dilution. Other factors include the PPi injection accuracy and the viral infusion volume. To achieve the expected efficiency (no less than 60%), minimal 700 nL virus needs to be infused into the PPi.</p>
