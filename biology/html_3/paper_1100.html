<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol provides instructions to improve flow cytometry analysis of marrow/peripheral blood cells by avoiding erythrolytic solutions, density gradients, and washing steps. We describe two basic approaches for identifying cell surface antigens with minimal sample perturbation, which have been successfully used to identify healthy and pathologically rare cells. The greatest advantage of these approaches is that they minimize the unwanted effect caused by sample preparation, allowing for improved study of live cells at the point of analysis.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol describes two basic flow cytometry-based methodologies for the quantitative analysis of cell surface expression markers on unlysed human whole blood and marrow specimens. This assay can be adapted to identify cell function in combination with cell surface immunophenotyping, even using mice and rats. Furthermore, this protocol can be adapted to fluorescence-activated cell sorting experiments, aimed at the isolation of rare and low abundance live cells in a much larger matrix of hematopoietic cells.</p>
<p>Peripheral blood/bone marrow samples were obtained from patients and healthy volunteers providing their written informed consent according to the protocol approved by the Ethical Committee of the Germans Trias i Pujol Hospital, in agreement with current Spanish legislation. Personal data management was in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR).</p>
<p>The assay uses monoclonal antibodies and fluorescent probes directly added to anti-coagulated fresh blood or marrow to both investigate cell immunophenotyping and function. After incubation, unlysed cell suspensions are directly diluted to achieve low coincidence with red blood cells (RBCs) and are acquired on a flow cytometer. Importantly, the method can be adapted to study different biomarkers with and without cell stimulation, provided protocols are optimized for cell preparation, staining conditions, flow cytometry settings and system configuration.</p>
<p>When designing an experiment, the investigator must consider that flow cytometry height data is generally more accurate than area data, owing to contributions in area from background coincidence or swarm detection from unlysed erythrocytes. Moreover, low background relative to signal is an important consideration for any parameter used for thresholding. Although forward scatter is the most common threshold parameter, fluorescence parameters chosen for thresholds will produce the highest separation possible from the background. We typically use fluorescence-based methods using cell-permeant DNA stains to provide a good compromise between performance and accurate manual gating, especially for highly concentrated cell products and pathological specimens. For example, viable DNA dyes, such as Vybrant™ DyeCycle™ Violet Stain or Hoechst 33342, can be used to detect nucleated cells in blood and in bone marrow, or to discriminate cell aggregates and debris, where scatter data is rapidly degraded with increasing event rate. Avoiding artifacts from sample manipulation, as well as the use of inaccurate light scatter triggering for small pathological cells or early apoptotic events as a consequence of cell shrinkage, is important. We also provide for this protocol a set of main figures illustrating the effect of red cell lysing reagents on cell loss and subsets, the effects on pulse parameter use and scatter degradation, choosing the appropriate threshold for event triggering, setting of threshold and voltage to exclude non-nucleated cells, as well as two representative polychromatic panels displaying color compensation.</p>
<p>Over the years we have successfully deployed this protocol using live and intact blood or marrow cells, such as those aimed at the study of healthy and pathological hematopoietic stem cells (<a href="#bib5">Fornas et al., 2000</a>), erythroid differentiation (<a href="#bib6">Fornas et al., 2002</a>), oxidative burst and neutrophil-platelet complexes (<a href="#bib2">Avendaño et al., 2008</a>), phagocytosis (<a href="#bib17">Lecube et al., 2011</a>), enzymatic activity (<a href="#bib12">Rico et al., 2016</a>, <a href="#bib13">2019</a>; <a href="#bib18">Bardina et al., 2020</a>), reactive oxygen species production (<a href="#bib4">Cossarizza et al., 2019</a>), cell-mediated cytotoxicity (<a href="#bib14">Rico et al., 2021a</a>), or to the study changes in conformation of the extracellular domain of PD-L1 (<a href="#bib15">Rico et al., 2021b</a>).</p>

<h2 id="materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</h2>
<h3 id="sec2.1">Flow cytometry</h3>
<p>The flow cytometer used in this protocol was the Invitrogen™ Attune™ NxT Flow Cytometer, equipped with 4 lasers (405 nm Violet, 488 nm Blue, 561 nm Yellow, and 637 nm Red) and 14 fluorescent detectors. It combines acoustic focusing technology coupled with traditional hydrodynamic focusing. The acoustic focusing system complements the hydrodynamic focusing and confers a precise output, especially at high flow rates.</p>
<p>Traditional hydrodynamic focusing flow cytometers can also deploy this protocol successfully. Our preliminary research was done using three- and four-color single-laser bench-top analyzers, such as the EPICS XL system II analyzer, the FACSCan, followed by the FACSCalibur flow cytometers, and with an EPICS Elite and FACSVantage cell sorters for cell sorting experiments (<a href="#bib5">Fornas et al., 2000</a>, <a href="#bib6">2002</a>).</p>
<p>Many flow cytometers and cell sorters can be configured to use the violet side scatter. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a molecule that readily absorbs violet laser (405 nm) light, whereas leukocytes do not (<a href="#bib10">Ost et al., 1998</a>), resulting in a unique scatter pattern when observing human whole blood in the context of blue (488 nm, BSSC) and violet (405 nm, VSSC) side scatter (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Blue side scatter alone can also provide very good results, even for discrimination of subpopulations of nucleated erythroid cells during maturation (<a href="#bib6">Fornas et al., 2002</a>). If the cytometer of choice is not equipped with a violet laser, or alternatively, the filter configuration does not allow changes in the configuration optics, the blue side scatter can be collected and used to further categorize the cells of interest. Importantly, for whole blood, forward scatter and side scatter cannot be used to discriminate between erythrocytes and leukocytes owing to the different size of these populations (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Strategy 1: Exploiting the difference in light-scattering properties between red blood cells and leukocytes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 35 min</div>
<p>Light scattering is commonly used to discriminate subpopulations of leukocytes by flow cytometry. By exploiting the differential scattering of red and white blood cells and simultaneously detecting side light scatter at 405 and 488 nm, it is possible to differentiate erythrocytes and leukocytes in diluted whole blood. This method is based in the differential light absorbance properties of oxyhemoglobin, with a maximum at 413.1 nm. As red blood cells exhibit a differential absorption of light at 405 nm and 488 nm, the dual scatter plot allows resolution of independent clusters of erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>At 488 nm, the side light scatter of RBCs clearly dominates the whole scatter plot, making the discrimination of leukocytes impossible. At 405 nm, there is an apparent shrinkage of the erythrocyte cluster based on the differential light absorption of hemoglobin at this wavelength (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Hence, the simultaneous detection of side light scatter at 405 and 488 nm the dual scatter plot allows discrimination of RBCs from leukocytes, avoiding the disadvantages of hemolysis, such as incomplete depletion of red blood cells, and potential damage and loss of leukocytes (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig3"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1100-Fig3.jpg" alt="Fig3.jpg">
<figcaption>
<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 3. Effect of red cell lysing reagents on cell loss and subsets</div>

Cell counts provided 1782.04 events/μL when using unlysed human peripheral blood (A) and 1049.08 events/μL after a 10 min ammonium chloride lysis protocol (B).</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Keep in mind the need to plan carefully for the number of cells needed when analyzing a whole blood sample for rare cells, to ensure that a statistically acceptable number of cells can be analyzed from a diluted unlysed blood sample. Determining this number can start with a simple calculation based on the relative or absolute number of target cells (<a href="#bib4">Cossarizza et al., 2019</a>). Using this strategy, lower sample input rates up to 200 μL/min will minimize scatter degradation. Intact erythrocytes outnumber leukocytes up to three orders of magnitude. Expected counts after acquiring 15 μL of the above prepared dilution will approximately provide the following cell distribution: 100,000 to 150,000 erythrocytes, 1,000 to 1,500 platelets and 150 to 250 leukocytes. Even with this small number of leukocytes, scattered light will help to easily discern populations of lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. Indicative percentage of erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes using peripheral blood obtained from healthy donors (n=10) gave 94.54%–92.13% of erythrocytes, 7.66%–529% of platelets, and 0.30%–0.13% of leukocytes.</p>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The flow cytometer used in this study was the Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher) (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a>). Setting up a flow cytometer to detect violet side scatter (VSSC) is easy and requires changing of the optical configuration by physically moving the 405 and the 450 nm filters within the instrument. Please refer to the information supplied by the flow cytometer manufacturer and follow the specific section explaining the procedure you should follow to set up VSSC detection.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> A fixed optical assembly will not allow physically changing bandpass and dichroic filters. Fixed optical architectures without a VSSC channel will not allow VSSC detection even if your cytometer is equipped with a violet laser.

<li>Collect freshly drawn human blood anti-coagulated with EDTA, ACD or heparin. In our laboratory we commonly use K3EDTA tubes validated for routine hematological testing.

Process the samples and collect the data preferably as soon as possible after collection.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> In order to preserve cell function and cell viability, fresh whole blood should be analyzed immediately after collection, when possible. Alternatively analyze samples within two hours of collection. If blood samples cannot be processed within two hours, samples should be kept at room temperature (20°C–24°C) for up to 24 h. Using this strategy, lower sample input rates up to 200 μL/min will minimize scatter degradation. Intact erythrocytes outnumber leukocytes up to three orders of magnitude. Expected counts after acquiring 15 μL of the above prepared dilution will approximately provide the following cell distribution: 100,000 to 150,000 erythrocytes, 1,000 to 1,500 platelets and 150 to 250 leukocytes.

<h3 id="sec3.2">Strategy 2: Exploiting the difference in fluorescence properties between leukocytes and erythrocytes</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 50 min</div>
<p>This strategy involves the use of fluorescent dyes and conjugated antibodies and is predicated on achieving a bright signal for identifying fluorescent triggered events. The method is based on the original strategy reported by <a href="#bib7">Hallermann et al. (1964)</a> in which acridine orange was used to show leukocyte staining in fresh human whole blood.</p>
<p>In this protocol, we describe a strategy for flow cytometric identification of leukocytes in which staining and analytical flow cytometry facilitate the detection and quantification of subpopulations of leukocytes as a reference for avoiding potential artifacts related to sample manipulation, such as those related to red cell lysing, centrifugation and washing steps, or alternatively in pathological specimens resistant to hemolysis. Target cells can be stained with viable DNA probes alone, or in combination with fluorescent conjugates and other fluorescent markers. Please note that some stains tend to be very bright with extensive spectral bleed across multiple channels, so this must be considered for panel design. Multi-laser excitation can often be leveraged to minimize color compensation. Importantly, all stains should be previously titrated to determine concentrations allowing the optimal fluorescence intensity and high signal to noise ratio. We recommend performing kinetic analysis as we previously described (<a href="#bib5">Fornas et al., 2000</a>), or alternately employing batteries of dilutions aimed at quantifying optimal concentrations.</p>
<p>The differentiation of leukocytes and erythrocytes can be easily validated using fluorescent conjugates and viable nucleic acid stains, either used to target CD45-expressing cells or living nucleated cells. The fluorescent threshold will then capture only CD45+ (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>) or alternatively nucleated cells (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a> and <a href="#fig7">7</a>), and will contribute to dramatically increasing throughput, even allowing identification of rare cells. We have routinely used this method for CD34+ cell discrimination (<a href="#bib13">Rico et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib1">Alvarez-Larran et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#bib5">Fornas et al., 2000</a>). The identification of nucleated red blood cells can also be validated using fluorescent conjugates used to target CD45 negative cells, in combination with glycophorin A (GpA), a sialoglycoprotein expressed on human red blood cells and erythroid precursor cells, useful for red cell differentiation studies, as we previously described in Cytometry Part B (<a href="#bib6">Fornas et al., 2002</a>).</p>

<p>This method has been previously compared with other established methods and it has been applied to peripheral blood and marrow of humans (<a href="#bib5">Fornas et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib11">Petriz et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib14">Rico et al., 2021a</a>, <a href="#bib15">2021b</a>) and rats (<a href="#bib9">Núñez- Espinosa et al., 2015</a>, <a href="#bib8">2016</a>). It avoids erythrocyte lysing procedures, washing steps and peripheral blood mononuclear cell density separation. Critically important for a minimal perturbation assay is selecting the height parameter (H) because it will be more accurate than the area parameter (A) due to significant contributions to the area pulse from the erythrocytes on the scattered light. Importantly, VSSC is more accurate than BSSC (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>).</p>

<p>When exploiting the difference in light-scattering properties between red blood cells and leukocytes (Strategy 1), the investigator should be able to visualize the data as shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, following flow cytometry analysis. The first plot is used to display BSSC and VSSC height in logarithmic scale. Dual side scatter analysis will provide information about whole blood populations. Debris in the bottom left corner is gated out. Hemoglobin absorption of light at 405 nm, reduces the RBCs 405 nm violet SSC signal, shifting the RBC population relative to WBCs and platelets. Platelets and WBCs are gated to display lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils using a forward scatter and side scatter height plot.</p>
<p>The differentiation of leukocytes and erythrocytes can be easily validated using fluorescent conjugates either to target specific antigen expressing cells or to combine with viable DNA stains. Moreover, the use of a fluorescent threshold will capture only fluorescent-labeled cells, and will dramatically increase throughput, even for rare cell identification and early apoptotic events (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>). We have routinely used this method for CD34+ cell determination by flow cytometry analysis. Please read <a href="#sec3.2">Strategy 2</a> for more information. <a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>, <a href="#fig6">6</a>, and <a href="#fig7">7</a> show how to analyze human progenitor cells in unlysed whole blood. Representative plots summarize how this configuration can be used to collect the violet side scatter and CD45 triggering to count CD34+ cells in mobilized peripheral blood (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>). Note that platelets and RBCs are not displayed in the classical BSSC and VSSC height plot, because an additional trigger is used for CD45+/low events. After incubation, cells were acquired using the lowest possible sample rate (12.5 events/μL) for 3 min, giving a total approximate yield of 10,000 CD45+ and 50 CD34+ events.</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 9. Effect of choosing an appropriate threshold for event triggering</div>
<p>Unlysed whole blood cell data obtained with a fluorescence threshold enables analysis of low forward scatter. Reduced FSC is an indicator of cell death as a consequence of cell shrinkage, and loss of cell membrane integrity have impact in decreased refractive index of cells. In general, granulocytes are the most affected cells, whereas populations of apoptotic lymphocytes and monocytes can also be discerned, globally representing more than 25% of total events as displayed here.</p>

<p><a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a> and <a href="#fig7">7</a> show representative plots about how to exploit the difference in fluorescence properties between leukocytes and erythrocytes. In this specific case, DNA viable stains are used to discriminate nucleated from non-nucleated cells. The concentration of the nucleic acid dye used is critical for optimal separation and signal to noise ratio (<a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>). Importantly, when diluting samples, the diluent should then also contain the same staining concentration of dye used to maintain equilibrium. For the evaluation of this methodology, preparation of dyes, labeling strategies with antibodies and probes may need optimization.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This method is designed for analysis of nucleated blood cells in unlysed whole blood. This protocol is not suitable for intracellular staining. This method may be unsuitable for analysis at higher sample rates if dilutions are not prepared accordingly. Assisted acoustic cytometers will provide high resolution when compared with classical hydrodynamic cytometers. Some nucleic acid stains can exhibit spillover into other channels and must be compensated for accurate data measurements (<a href="#fig11">Figures 11</a> and <a href="#fig12">12</a>). Potential clogging issues can emerge when using marrow specimens, and samples can be easily filtered using a 50 μM nylon mesh. Some fluorescent dyes can be especially sticky and its convenient to perform a deep flow cell cleaning. Hellmanex® III is a liquid alkaline concentrate for highly effective cleaning of cuvettes made of glass and quartz glass and other sensitive optical parts. Alternatively, Contrad<sup>TM</sup> 70, a liquid detergent concentrate phosphate-free, chlorine-free, and biodegradable can be used to effective cleaning cuvettes and tubing.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Scattered light is inadequate to discriminate erythrocytes (step 2, 3).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Possible reasons are that sample rate is too high and is affected by RBC coincidence. Alternatively, Area pulse is used, instead of Height pulse. Since light scatter degradation increases with event rate. Decrease sample rate or dilute the sample as a potential solution. Moreover, Height is more accurate than Area data, and H pulse data should be used instead the Area pulse.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>No fluorescent signal is detected from nucleated cells (step 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Possible reasons are that the laser and PMT settings are incompatible with the nucleic acid stain or the fluorescent probe used, or alternatively that a low PMT voltage for the specific fluorescence channel is used. Increase or decrease fluorescence-triggered throughput will help to verify nucleated cells signal. If background Is too high, ensure the proper instrument settings are loaded prior to acquisition as a potential solution. Use suitable positive and negative controls to optimize settings for every fluorochrome. Choose appropriate threshold for event triggering. Verify dye concentration, staining time, temperature and cell counting. Dilution reduces background.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Nucleic acid dye or fluorescent conjugate/probe staining is weak (step 25).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A possible reason is that samples are compromised or aged. Use freshly collected specimens and exclude necrotic cells as a potential solution.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Potential problems may occur when there is a false positive signal due to spillover in one of the fluorescent channels. Using minimal perturbation assays, these problems can be avoided using color compensation and control samples (step 26).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Color compensation can be performed as described by the manufacturer, using the same software alternatives provided, such as those calculated and applied using the compensation matrix. Open the compensation setup dialog. Please note that when exploiting the difference in fluorescence properties between leukocytes and erythrocytes, unstained controls should include a nucleic acid stain. First of all, set the threshold and appropriate voltage for the nucleic acid stain, and later adjust the voltages for the unstained controls. The compensation matrix will be calculated as new compensation controls are recorded. Then repeat the same process for each of the single stained controls.</p>
