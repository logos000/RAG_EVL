<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We present a gnotobiotic system for microbiota reconstitution on <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> under contrasting iron availability. This system induces iron starvation in plants by providing an unavailable form, mimicking conditions in alkaline soils. Inoculation of taxonomically diverse bacteria reconstitutes plants with a synthetic microbiota, allowing observation of nutrient-dependent interactions with commensals. Experimental optimization, including media composition and preparation of seedlings and bacteria, is discussed. This system provides a framework that can be adapted to study plant-microbiota interactions in further nutritional contexts.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Harbort et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>In this protocol, we will assess <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> accession Col-0 performance when grown axenically or in the presence of a synthetic community (SynCom) of bacteria on two media with contrasting iron availability: a replete, “available iron” condition and an iron-limiting “unavailable iron” condition. In this system, the concentration of iron is identical in both media (100 μM); the availability is varied by providing forms of iron that differ in their solubility at high pH. By buffering the media strongly at pH 7.4 with 10 mM HEPES, we mimic iron-limiting calcareous soils, where iron is present but unavailable to plants (<a href="#bib4">Kobayashi and Nishizawa, 2012</a>). In the “unavailable iron” condition, iron(III) (supplied as FeCl<sub>3</sub>) is sparingly soluble and is unavailable to plants. This is critical for assessing nutritionally beneficial host-microbiota interactions, which are precluded in artificial systems where iron is removed altogether (<a href="#bib2">Harbort et al., 2020</a>). As a control “available iron” medium with the same iron content and pH, the media is supplied with the same concentration of a chelated form of iron (FeEDTA, Ferric sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate), which has increased solubility even in these alkaline conditions. To assess the impact of bacterial commensals on host performance in these conditions, the media are inoculated with a SynCom of rhizobacterial strains originally isolated from <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots grown in soil (<a href="#bib1">Bai et al., 2015</a>). Rhizobacterial culture collections of different origins can also be employed and compared. The complexity and diversity of the SynCom can be adjusted to suit the experimental question, or reduced to single strains in mono-associations.</p>
<p>In this protocol, surface-sterilized seedlings are pre-germinated for 5–6 days on axenic growth medium containing vitamins and sucrose, and then transferred to experimental conditions with controlled iron availability and commensals. Pre-germination and seedling transfer improve seedling germination rate and synchrony, which can vary between seed batches and genotypes, reducing variation within each condition.</p>

<ol start="10">
<li>Inoculate bacterial cultures
<ol type="a">
<li>Timing for this step will depend on the bacteria to be used and the growth conditions. Different taxa of bacteria grow at different rates. It also makes a difference if bacteria are cultured in 96-well format deep-well plates (for large number of strains, but grow more slowly), or test tubes (for fewer strains, but allows for faster growth). Allow bacteria to grow to late exponential growth phase.</li>
<li>For microbiota reconstitution with a taxonomically diverse synthetic community (SynCom), inoculate cultures in deep-well plates in appropriate nutrient medium (e.g., 1/2 TSB medium) and seal with micropore film to allow aeration. Culturing in 96-well format enables faster experiment setup when using many strains.</li>
<li>Grow SynCom strains for 5 days at 25°C with shaking, until even slow-growing strains have significant growth.</li>
<li>One day before experiment setup, resuspend strains by pipetting, dilute 1:100 into fresh medium, and grow 15–18 h at 25°C. Keep the original cultures growing as well. This ensures that both fast- and slowly growing strains are present in exponential growth phase.</li>

<li>Using a scalpel, cut through micropore tape seal and open plates.</li>
<li>To measure shoot fresh weight (SFW), cut seedlings at the shoot-root junction, being careful not to cut off any leaves.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>After 2 weeks on experimental plates, there should be clear differences in axenic plant growth between available and unavailable iron conditions (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> ). Plants grown on unavailable iron conditions should be smaller, with shorter roots, and noticeably chlorotic (yellow) leaves compared to plants on available iron. Bacteria-inoculated plants will have variable phenotypes, depending on the bacteria and plant genotype. Often a small proportion of plants will not survive the experiment, especially in iron-limiting media. These plants should be included in the results and recorded as zero values.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>For statistical analysis, we recommend performing experiments with three replica plates per condition, each containing 5–6 individual plants (n = 15–18 plants per experiment). Shoot fresh weight should be plotted with boxplots or other appropriate methods to visualize individual data points (single plants) and visualize data dispersion. Chlorophyll content should be normalized to sample input weight and plotted as fresh weight showing individual data points (pooled leaf samples) and data dispersion. For statistical analysis of plant weight data, nonparametric tests – such as a Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and/or Dunn’s pairwise comparison test – are preferred as data are usually not normally distributed, especially when zero values are present. Leaf chlorophyll content usually shows approximately normal distribution and should be analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This assay provides a model for studying the impact of bacterial commensals and iron deficiency on plant performance. Especially relevant is the mechanism of iron limitation, which mimics conditions in iron-limiting alkaline soils where iron is present but unavailable to plants. However, as with all experimental models, some limitations should be considered during the interpretation of results.</p>
<p>In this protocol, plants are grown for 5–6 days axenically before being transferred to media containing microbes. This does not reflect conditions in nature, where colonization of commensals would begin immediately upon germination. The importance of interactions with commensals during this early phase of root microbiota establishment may be significant. Similarly, plants are exposed to iron-limiting growth media after pre-germination on media in which iron is readily available instead of immediately upon germination. Iron-limiting conditions may also impact the process of seed germination significantly, which is overlooked in this assay. Furthermore, as plants are grown in petri dishes on an agar matrix, the full life cycle and reproductive success of the plant cannot be assessed due to space limitations and high humidity. Results in this reductionist system should be cautiously extrapolated to conditions in soils, as it does not reproduce the full chemical and biological diversity of soil or soil physical parameters. When coupled with experiments in nutritionally characterized soils for phenotype confirmation, this assay provides a robust and amenable method to studying plant-microbiota interactions in the context of iron deficiency.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1: contamination</h3>
<p>Visible bacterial or fungal contamination develops on seedlings during germination</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Surface sterilization of seeds prior to germination is unsuccessful. Some seed batches may be contaminated with microbes or spores that are more difficult to eliminate. Several adjustments can be made to improve sterilization efficiency (<a href="#bib5">Lindsey et al., 2017</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Longer incubation times in 70% ethanol</li>
<li>Sterilization with a solution containing bleach and Tween 20</li>
<li>Sterilization with chlorine gas</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2: plants do not survive or grow on iron-limiting media</h3>
<p>Many, or all, plants grown on iron-limiting media (FeCl <sub>3</sub>) fail to grow, or are dead by the end of the experiment</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The pH-induced iron limitation may be too severe. The buffer concentration or final pH of the media may be too high for plants to overcome. Measure the final pH of the agar media by cutting out a section of agar, shaking in twice the volume of ddH<sub>2</sub>O for 30 min, and measuring the pH. Ensure that the pH is not above 7.4. Adjust the pH of the HEPES stock solution if necessary, and again check the pH of final media. Alternatively, slightly reduce the amount of HEPES stock added if your stock is too concentrated or alkaline.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3: large variation in plant growth</h3>
<p>Large variation in plant growth within plates or among experimental groups</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This could arise from multiple potential sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seedling transfer
<ul>
<li>Be sure to transfer only germinated and growing seedlings to experimental plates. It is normal that a small portion of seeds do not germinate or seedling growth ceases after germination. These should be discarded and not transferred to experimental plates.</li>
<li>Be careful not to injure seedlings during transfer, as this will impact plant growth. If injury of a seedling is suspected during transfer, discard it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Insufficient bacterial inoculation
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the media is cooled to below 45°C before adding bacteria. If not properly cooled, the heat may kill the bacteria.</li>
<li>Check the final OD<sub>600</sub> of your bacterial inoculant is 0.1. If this problem persists, the dose of inoculum can be increased.</li>
</ul>
