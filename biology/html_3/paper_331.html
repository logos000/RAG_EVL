<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Growth and offspring count are two commonly determined toxicological endpoints for chemical- or gene-induced developmental and reproductive effects in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Here, we present a protocol for a 96 h, medium-throughput assay, assessing both endpoints quantitatively within an automated framework using open-source software. The assay utilizes whole 96-well fluorescence images taken with a high-content screening system. Alternatively, conventional fluorescence images can also be utilized with only a few adjustments.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib9">Wittkowski et al. (2019)</a>.</p>

<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> maintenance</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 weeks</div>
<ol>
<li>Food bacteria preparation
<ol type="a">
<li>Prepare OP50 precultures by incubating 6 mL DYT or LB medium and 10 μL of cryopreserved OP50 in glass tubes while shaking (100 rpm) for 12–14 h at 37°C.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Incubation time of precultures should not exceed 14 h.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Cryopreserved OP50 contains 50% OP50 in DYT medium grown for 12–14 h and 50% glycerol. It can be stored at −80°C.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We used DYT medium pH = 7.0 in our published study (<a href="#bib9">Wittkowski et al., 2019</a>) because it results in slightly higher yields of OP50, but using OP50 grown in LB medium in the indicated concentrations (OD) below does not alter the outcome of the experiments.</div>
</li>
<li>Inoculate each OP50 preculture in 200 mL DYT or LB medium using covered glass flasks and grow the cultures while shaking (100 rpm) at 37°C for 8 h.
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause Point:</span> Prior to purification steps, OP50 cultures can be stored at 4°C for at least one day.</div>
</li>
<li>Cool down M9 buffer to 4°C.</li>
<li>Transfer OP50 cultures into 50 mL tubes and collect bacteria by centrifugation (10 min, 3,200 × <i>g</i>, 4°C) and removal of the supernatants. Refill tubes with 5 mL of M9 buffer, resuspend the pellets, and combine two tubes each. Wash the empty tubes with 10 mL M9 and combine again. Centrifuge an additional time and repeat the previous steps. Wash combined pellets a third time, discard the supernatant, and add 20 mL fresh S-Complete medium per tube. Resuspend the pellets and combine all bacteria into one batch. This way the bacteria are resuspended in the same medium (S-Complete) that is used for worm maintenance as well as for the experiments, and the final composition of the liquid medium is independent of the used bacteria concentration.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Bacteria can be stored at 4°C in S-Complete for up to one month. We found no relation between the OP50 storage time within the first month and the protocol outcome. Thus, the food content can be approximated by simply measuring the OD<sub>600</sub>, which is less labor intensive than calculating cfu. Following the protocol above, we typically have an OD<sub>600</sub> outcome of ≈ 10–13 in S-Complete (i.e., after washing and 10-fold concentration of the OP50 culture) using an Ultrospec 10 cell density meter, which initially corresponds roughly to about 1.5–1.9 × 10<sup>10</sup> cfu/mL when grown in DYT. Please note that for OD<sub>600</sub> measurement we dilute the bacteria culture to an OD<sub>600</sub> &lt; 1 and &gt; 0.2. Exceeding values are calculated from the measured value multiplied with the dilution factor.</div>
</li>
<li>Determine the OD<sub>600</sub> of the bacteria suspension photometrically in triplicates.</li>
<li>To facilitate the course of the experiments, it is advantageous to prepare OP50 dilutions of the same OD<sub>600</sub> for every new OP50 batch. We prepare OD<sub>600</sub> = 6.75 OP50 dilutions as stocks for further use in the experiments and for maintenance. In this manner, the same ratio of liquid medium and OP50 stock can always be used.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The optical density values can vary between different photometric devices due to different optical set ups (<a href="#bib2">Eppendorf, 2015</a>). To allow you to transfer our OD<sub>600</sub> values to your photometric device, we measured the colloidal silica suspension LUDOX CL-X in an Ultrospec 10 cell density meter (<a href="#bib7">Rutten et al., 2019</a>). It shows a single point reference value of 0.07 using ddH<sub>2</sub>O as blank. To transfer the OD<sub>600</sub> values given in this protocol to any other instrument measuring OD<sub>600</sub>, a simple conversion factor can be calculated (Ultrospec 10 User Manual).</div>
</li>
<li>
<b>Optional:</b> To determine cfu:
<ol type="i">
<li>Prepare a dilution series of the OP50 suspension in S-Complete in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128) and measure OD<sub>600</sub> in triplicates.</li>
<li>Further dilute the suspensions by a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> with S-Complete and spread 50 μL on three LB agar plates each.</li>
<li>Incubate plates at least 12 h at 37°C.</li>
<li>Count the colonies and determine a linear relationship between OD<sub>600</sub> and colony forming units (cfu). Use the graph slope to calculate the cfu/mL in the dilution series and the content in the undiluted bacteria suspension.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Maintenance on nematode growth medium
<ol type="a">
<li>Spread 70 μL of OP50 stock solution on NGM agar plates. Incubate at 37°C for at least 12 h.</li>
<li>Transfer a chunk of NGM agar with worms twice a week to new plates to keep them well-fed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Maintenance in liquid medium
<ol type="a">
<li>Optionally cool down M9 buffer to 4°C.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Using cool M9 buffer slightly facilitates pelleting of the worms and eggs and should stop the bleaching reaction faster, however, uncooled M9 can also be used.</div>
</li>
<li>Wash a NGM agar plate (10 cm in diameter) full of mixed-stage worms with 5 mL M9 and transfer them into a 15 mL tube. To start a new liquid culture in a t25 cell culture flask, 4,000 eggs are needed. Therefore, the NGM agar plate should contain at least 500 adult worms.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Worms and eggs tend to stick to the surface of plastic equipment. Hence, we recommend to use low retention tips.</div>
</li>
<li>Pellet the worms (2 min, 1,300 × <i>g</i>, 4°C) and gently aspirate the supernatant. Wash pellets two times with 10 mL M9 buffer and leave 2 mL at the last washing step.</li>
<li>Add bleach solution (420 μL 12% NaClO + 250 μL 10 N NaOH) to each sample of worms and use a tube shaker for around 8 min at 2,000 rpm (Heidolph Instruments &amp; Co.KG, SC, DE) to lyse the worms until worms are no longer visible under the microscope.</li>
<li>Immediately add 10 mL M9 to the tubes and pellet the eggs (2 min, 1,300 × <i>g</i>, 4°C). Aspirate as much of the supernatant as possible without aspirating the eggs and wash the eggs two additional times with 10 mL M9.</li>
<li>Resuspend the egg pellets in 3 mL S-Complete and count the egg density in the solution.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> As stated for counting worms in liquid cultures (<a href="#bib8">Scanlan et al., 2018</a>), counting eggs in liquid medium is equally depending on variables like shaking, priming of pipette tips, and sampling location within a tube. We transfer 100 μL egg solution from the middle of the liquid into new 1.5 mL tubes and prime low retention 10 μL pipette tips with 0.01% Triton X-100 solution. We place five dots of 5 μL each on petri dishes and count the number of eggs per dot under a stereo microscope.</div>
</li>
<li>Start a new 10 mL liquid culture in a t25 cell culture flask containing 4,000 eggs and sufficient OP50 to keep the worms well-fed and avoid starvation.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In our liquid cultures with a density of 400 worms/mL, a final OP50 concentration of OD<sub>600</sub> = 2.7 results in a high yield of eggs after three and four days.</div>
</li>
<li>Twice a week, after three or four days, transfer worms into 15 mL tubes and repeat steps 3c–3g to maintain <i>C. elegans</i> liquid culture.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> All our cultures and experiments are kept at 20°C in cooling incubators (Binder KT 115) with a fan speed at 60%, without shaking. We found that under our conditions, i.e., 400 worms/mL and a filling height of only 4–5 mm, there are no considerable differences in development between the individual worms in one container. The exemplary evaluation of three independent experiments, in which a subset of at least 200 worms was photographed and scored for their developmental stage, showed that 98% of the worms were adult and gravid 72 h after feeding age synchronized L1 larvae.</div>

<ol start="7">
<li>Use the device software “Harmony” (Perkin Elmer) to export “measurements”, which include images in TIFF format and metadata in XML format. These TIFF files use a 16-bit gray color definition. Using a regular picture viewer (e.g., previewer from Windows) will show far too dark pictures.</li>
<li>Merge image tiles without overlap for whole-well images. As a merging tool, we use “CombineTIFF”, a self-programmed MATLAB-based program specialized for our needs when processing images generated with the Opera Phenix High Content Screening System. Find the software tool (CombineTIFF.exe) and the associated code (CombineTIFF.m) in Mendeley Data (folder: CombineTIFF_Software_and_Code).

<p><sup>a</sup>In contrast to “Worms_4d” and “Worms_4d_small”, offspring objects are not expanded prior to object measurements to improve the separation of objects.</p>
<p><sup>b</sup>Chemical treatment may massively affect nematode growth up to a point, at which it is not possible to discriminate small 4-day-old worms (Worms_4d_small) and offspring of unaffected worms (Offspring) by size. Hence, “Worms_4d_small” need to be identified separately. Images of “Worms_4d_small” tend to have more background signal due to an increased amount of stained food bacteria remaining in the wells. In order to avoid false “Offspring” identification, “Worms_4d_small” are defined to have no offspring during data evaluation.</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>Data quantification and selected statistical analyses can be performed fully automated with a workflow (C.elegans_assay.knwf) constructed in the open-source software KNIME (<a href="#bib1">Berthold et al., 2008</a>). This workflow can be downloaded from Mendeley Data (folder: KNIME_workflow). An example dataset of merged raw images (folder: Test_data_combinedTIFFs), CellProfiler output images and related CSV files (folder: Test_data_CellProfiler_Output) are also included. Objects are already scored as described in step 10e.</p>
<ol>
<li>Import the workflow “C.elegans_assay.knwf” in KNIME and open it.</li>
<li>The example CSV files are already integrated and executed in the workflow, the input files can be found in the subfolder “data” of the “C.elegans_assay” folder in the KNIME workspace. The output files can be downloaded from Mendeley Data (folder: Test_data_KNIME_Output). For analyzing your own data, import the five respective CellProfiler CSV output files in the “CSV Reader” nodes by configuring the node and changing the “Input location”. Execute the nodes afterwards.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For further information on the function and configuration of specific KNIME nodes, check out the integrated KNIME help-function available for each node. Additionally, KNIME Quickstart Guides are offered on the KNIME homepage (<a href="https://www.knime.com/">https://www.knime.com/</a>).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> All nodes that need to be checked before the workflow execution are highlighted in red.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Check whether the texts in the CSV files were correctly converted into columns by viewing the “CSV Reader” node file tables. Otherwise, configure the column delimiter in the reader options of the node configurations accordingly.</li>
<li>Configure the “Excel Writer (XLS)” node in the last segment of the workflow. Change the “Output Location” by selecting a “Local File System” and browse toward an output directory of your choice. Enter a new file name, if necessary. If you choose a “Local File System” output directory, you need to configure all “Excel Sheet Appender (XLS)” nodes to “Local File System” as well. The output excel file contains one tab with the processed output data and one tab with the descriptive statistics for each treatment, respectively.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Configurations of nodes result in a reset of all subsequent nodes.</div>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The KNIME workflow combines multiple data progression steps using defined nodes (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). CellProfiler offers a total of nine different parameters describing the shape of the worms (Area, MajorAxisLength, MaxFeretDiameter, MaximumRadius, MeanRadius, MedianRadius, MinFeretDiameter, MinorAxisLength, Perimeter) and three parameters describing the worm offspring (Count_Offspring, Area_Offspring, Perimeter_Offspring). All these data are combined into one table for each of the two treatments on one plate. Within this process, “Worms_4d_small” are defined to have no offspring, as mentioned in the <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> description. Next, all wells not containing exactly one object scored as “0” are excluded from the data tables. Focusing on the net worm growth, the median values of L1 larvae are subtracted for each of the nine shape parameters (e.g., Area<sub>NET</sub> = Area − 429 pixels). Thus, a worm area value of zero actually represents no worm growth after 96 h. L1 shape parameters were determined by measuring &gt; 2,000 freshly hatched L1 larvae in CellProfiler as described above (typical diameter: 7–30 pixels, expanded for 2 pixels). Since L1 size and form may vary between different strains and cultures, you may also determine your own L1 parameters and integrate them into the KNIME workflow (metanodes highlighted in blue). Finally, processed data of both treatments on one plate are joined in one exportable table (default name: “plate1_results.xlsx”). Descriptive statistics summarizing the data are generated as well as Box Plots for data visualization.</div>

<span class="optional-title">Optional:</span> KNIME also provides nodes for statistical analyses.

To activate the single sample t test, connect the last “Joiner” node with both “Single sample t test” nodes and execute. This generates new tabs in the output excel file.</div>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Parts of the automatic data acquisition and analysis in this protocol are designed for a defined sample size and treatment pattern. Thus, minor manual adjustments may be necessary for experimental changes. Additionally, the applicability of this protocol is limited to the solubility of test chemicals in the aqueous test medium. Organic solvents may act as solubilizing agents, but they need to be tested for solvent control effects appropriately. We already demonstrated that <i>C. elegans</i> development and reproduction are influenced by higher concentrations of the organic solvent DMSO in this assay (<a href="#bib9">Wittkowski et al., 2019</a>). Importantly, most toxicological effects depend on the chemical’s internal concentration in the target organs. We showed that even for structural similar chemicals, nominal concentrations in the medium do not necessarily reflect comparable internal concentrations in the worm tissues (<a href="#bib9">Wittkowski et al., 2019</a>). In our case, analytical quantification of five structurally similar azole fungicides in worms revealed up to twelve-fold deviations of internal concentrations revealing toxicokinetic differences. Furthermore, the exposure of a living organism and living food bacteria, both equipped with a noticeable biotransformation system, may bias the estimation of substance effects due to possible substance degradation processes within the 96 h incubation time. Previous attempts to use UV-killed as well as heat-killed OP50 in this assay were unsuccessful because feeding dead bacteria resulted in a strong developmental delay of the worms.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Control worm development deviates between experiments.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The reproducibility of this protocol depends on many factors in worm maintenance. Try to standardize as many factors as possible to exclude potential confounders. For example, to adapt worms to liquid cultures when transferred from agar plates, we keep worms in liquid culture for at least three generations before experimental testing. Interestingly, among others, <i>C. elegans</i> developmental speed, growth rate and fecundity are strongly dependent on maternal age (<a href="#bib6">Perez et al., 2017</a>). The timing of egg preparation may thus have an impact on larval development, leading to inter-day deviations. Try to follow a consistent schedule for <i>C. elegans</i> maintenance to e.g., use eggs derived from mothers of the same age in addition to the L1 arrest described in the protocol. Fluctuations in the amount of applied food bacteria may also lead to reproducibility issues. Try to adhere to a strict bacteria preparation protocol.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Offspring are aspirated during manual plate washing.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check if offspring have settled before aspiration. Do not aspirate from the bottom of the wells. Place the tips just underneath the surface of the well contents and move them slowly downwards simultaneously with the dropping liquid level (see <a href="#mmc2">Methods Video S2</a>). Choose the aspiration speed of the pipette as low as reasonable to prevent loss of offspring. Optionally, transfer aspirated liquid into new 96 well plates and check well contents microscopically for offspring.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>CellProfiler does not identify worms or offspring correctly.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Due to automatic camera flat field correction, the brightness of images may vary considerably, especially if comparing images of different experiments or devices. Hence, it may be necessary to adjust the threshold value individually for each experiment. For this purpose, start the CellProfiler Test Mode. Adjust the lower and upper threshold bounds or the threshold correction factor until worms and offspring are highlighted adequately. Raise the threshold range to darken the objects and lower the threshold range to brighten the objects (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>No high-content screening system is available for image acquisition.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use manual fluorescence microscopy to generate whole-well images. Since the well bottoms are sometimes not plain enough to record worms entirely on a single plane, especially after heating, it may be necessary to record a z-stack and use maximum intensity projection to outline worms and offspring properly. Before importing images into CellProfiler, renaming of the images according to the well identifier plus suffix (e.g., “<b>B02</b>_p01_ch1sk1” for well B2) will automatically group the images as described in step 9 of the “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</a>” section. Use the CellProfiler Test Mode to adjust threshold values in the “Threshold” modules and disk sizes in the “Erosion” modules until the background signals are minimal and “Worms_4d” and “Offspring” are highlighted. Run the CellProfiler pipeline and KNIME workflow as usual to obtain results as described. As proof-of-principle, we recorded wells manually using a LSM 880 microscope equipped with a motorized stage (10× objective, 570–630 nm filter, 36 tiles with 5% overlap). Background signals were higher, thus threshold values were adjusted to 1.8E-6 in the “Threshold” modules and disk sizes were adjusted to 3 in the “Erosion” modules. “Worms_4d” and “Offspring” could be identified successfully this way (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>A different sample size is chosen.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The experimental setup as well as the software automating the data acquisition and analysis is configured for a sample size of 30 per treatment. When using a different sample size or treatment pattern than that showed in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>, the automation steps of this protocol utilizing CellProfiler and KNIME is no longer working. If a smaller sample size than 30 is chosen for each treatment, the easiest way is to stick with the treatment pattern and fill the missing wells with 150 μL water. If a larger sample size is used, you may use a multiple of 30 and combine the data in the process. Otherwise, the CellProfiler pipeline and the KNIME workflow need to be adapted. A general solution is to remove the automatic grouping function to gain joint output files for further analyses in a software of your choice. To remove the automatic grouping function in the CellProfiler pipeline, reset the “Metadata”, “NamesAndTypes” and “Groups” modules. This way, all images will be analyzed simultaneously creating joint output files. Next, change the input image of the first “RescaleIntensity” module to “RawData” and remove the duplicate “RescaleIntensity” module. Furthermore, deselect all other duplicate modules of “Treatment 2” (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A). They can be recognized by the suffix “_2” in the module output names. Also remove the respective objects of “Treatment 2” in the “MeasureObjectSizeShape” and “MeasureObjectSizeShape” modules and the export of the datasets “Expand_Worms_4d_2” and “Expand_Worms_4d_small_2” in the “ExportToSpreadsheet” module. Images can now be analyzed, creating only “Worms_4d_1.csv”, “Worms_4d_small_1.csv” and “Offspring.csv” files. After scoring the objects, import those files into the respective KNIME “CSV Reader” nodes and delete the two “CSV Reader” nodes for the “Treatment 2” files (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B). Delete the connection between the last “Treatment 1” metanode, and the Joiner node (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>C) and execute the workflow.</p>
