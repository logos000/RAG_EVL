<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Substances are commonly administered orally in mouse experiments. Here, I describe how to voluntarily administer substances orally in a time- and dose-controlled manner to laboratory mice. This minimizes injury potential and stress often associated with the commonly used intragastric gavage technique. Here, the drug is incorporated into artificially sweetened and flavored jelly and given to mice previously trained to eat the jelly. This can be used for acute and chronic oral drug treatment or for oral glucose tolerance tests.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib5">Zhang et al. (2010)</a> and <a href="#bib1">Cox et al. (2010)</a>.</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We used a sucrose-derived non-caloric sweetener, sucralose, to avoid introducing additional calorie into the jelly. Moreover, unlike sucrose, sucralose does not stimulate insulin or incretin hormone release, or alters gastric emptying (<a href="#bib2">Fujita et al., 2009</a>, <a href="#bib4">Ma et al., 2009</a>), making it suitable for masking drugs in studies investigating effects on glucose homeostasis.</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min + 3 h</div>

<li>Use a 24-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate as the jelly mold. One jelly refers to the jelly formed in one well.
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Round or V-bottom tissue culture plates could be used as an alternative. Also culture plates with 96 or 384 wells are possible but I found the flat-bottom 24 tissue culture plate allows for easier scooping out of the jelly.</div>
</li>
<li>For 1 drug jelly, add 450 μL of drug solution into one well, and then add 1,300 μL of gelatin stock into the well.
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Gelatin stock solution does not need to be very hot, however should be clear and runny to ensure proper mixing with the drug solution.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> If the drug is heat-sensitive, let the gelatin stock solution to cool down at about 22°C (room temperature in most laboratories) before adding into the drug solution. Make sure the gelatin stock remains clear and runny to ensure proper mixing the drug solution.</div>
</li>
<li>Add 150 μL of flavoring essence imitation (see <a href="#key-resources-table">Key resources table</a>). Mix thoroughly with spatula
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Ensure thorough mixing.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This step adds flavoring to the jelly to further enhance the palatability. The volume of flavoring chosen here works quite well in the current studies. However, it can be altered according to the strength of the flavoring used, mice preference, or study suitability. If an increase in volume is considered, keep in mind that this will increase the volume of the jelly and thus the time mice would use to consume the piece of treatment jelly (see <b>Note</b> under step 5d).</div>
</li>
<li>Cover with the plate lid and let the jelly to set at 4°C for at least 3 h.
<div class="pause-point">
<span class="pause-point-title">Pause Point:</span> The jelly can be stored at 4°C for several days without losing its flavor, however the drug stability in the jelly needs to be taken into consideration. The maximum period stored at 4°C for jellies used in the current studies was 3 days. Sealing the jelly plate with parafilm will prevent water loss from the jelly and thus maintain jelly texture and palatability.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> While we have not tried this, an alternative to storing jellies at 4°C would be storing them at −20°C. This would prolong the storage period and thus allow for big batch of jellies being made to avoid between-batch variations. If this option is chosen, make sure the jellies are completely set before transferring them to −20°C. Additionally, the drug stability in jelly at −20°C needs to be considered.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> To ensure the consumption of the entire piece of jelly by the mouse in a single attempt so that the drug achieves a peak concentration in the circulation, the volume of the jelly is an important factor to consider. The finished jelly has a total volume of 1.9 cm<sup>3</sup> (450 + 1,300 + 150 = 1,900 μL) (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>A and 1B). This cylindrical block will then be cut into 8 equal pieces with a scalpel and one of these pieces with an approximate volume of 0.24 cm<sup>3</sup>, will be given to each mouse (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C). This volume of jelly can be consumed by a mouse (of 22–32 g body weight of both genders in current studies) in a single attempt that takes less than 1 min (<a href="#mmc1">Methods Videos S1</a> and <a href="#mmc2">S2</a>). Please see suggestions under <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> for young mice that need jelly of smaller volume.</div>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Drug dosing: Since 1/8<sup>th</sup> of 1 jelly will be given to one mouse per treatment, each jelly needs to contain the amount of drug sufficient for 8 mice and dissolved in 450 μL of drug solution. For example, we used 10 mg/kg dosage for each Rimonabant treatment, average body weight of the mice we used was 30 g. Thus, we made the jelly with each jelly containing 2.4 mg of Rimonabant: 10 mg/kg × 30 g × 8 mice = 2.4 mg resulting in a drug concentration of 5.33 mg/mL (2.4 mg/0.45 mL).</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> An alternative to cutting one jelly into 8 equal pieces is to pipette 240 μL (i.e., 0.24 cm<sup>3</sup>) of the jelly mixture (containing the drug solution, gelatin stock and flavoring) onto a parafilm, and let these individual jelly droplets to set at 4°C. Each jelly droplet is equivalent to 1/8<sup>th</sup> of jelly, thus can be given to mouse for treatment without cutting. While this is possible and more convenient, one caution is that pipetting hot jelly mixture can yield inaccurate volumes, thus producing jelly droplets containing vary amount of drug depending on the deviations from targeted volume.</div>
<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> Another alternative is to prepare smaller jellies to have each jelly contain the amount of drug appropriate for 1 treatment. If this potion is chosen, a smaller mold would be required. I suggest using a shallow mold for easy scooping the smaller individual jellies. In addition, please see <b>Notes</b>: drug dosing under step 5d (this step) to adjust the volumes of each jelly components. It is worth to note that while this option enhances the consistency of drug quantity in each drug jelly, it does not enhance drug dosing precision. To achieve precise drug dosing, the amount of jelly given to individual mouse needs to be weighed out individually based on the total drug contained in the jelly and the body weight of the mouse. If this level of precision is required for drug treatment, please follow steps for making and giving jelly for oral glucose tolerance test (Option 2).</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 4 days, 1–2 h for 1<sup>st</sup> <b>day, 10–20 min per day for following 3 days</b>
</div>
<p>Since mice exert innate avoidance to novel food (<a href="#bib3">Kronenberger and Medioni, 1985</a>), a training period is necessary for mice to overcome neophobia and eat the jelly. The training involves fasting the singly housed mouse overnight followed by vehicle jelly (that does not contain a drug) presentation and 3-day follow-up jelly presentation without food restriction at the same time of the day.</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>After 2–4 days of training, the majority (over 95%) of our mice started to eat the jelly within 1 min after the presentation of the jelly in their cage and finished the entire piece of jelly in a single attempt. In our experience, after the initial 2 - 4 days of training period to overcome neophobia, mice maintain their interest to consume jelly even when the jelly is re-introduced after 2–3 weeks of absence. Thus this method can be used for studies when drug is only given periodically. It is worth noting that while out of the scope of this protocol, a pre-evaluation of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics may be warranted for each drug administered.</p>
<p>This method can also be used to deliver glucose to mice for an oral glucose tolerance test. Mice consume the glucose jelly in the same manner as consuming the vehicle jelly during the training session. The effectiveness of this method to orally deliver glucose is evidenced by the sharp rise in serum glucose and insulin concentrations after consuming the glucose jelly (glucose dose 3 g/kg) with the peak glucose and insulin concentrations in serum achieved at 30 min and 5 min, respectively, after the completion of glucose jelly consumption (<a href="#bib1">Cox et al., 2010</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This voluntary jelly-dosing method include a training period of approximately 2–4 days to ensure consistent and reliable drug delivery. This lag may be suboptimal if a study involves dosing an animal only once. However, once the mice have been trained, they maintain their acquaintance and interest to the jelly even after a jelly-free period (3-weeks is the longest we have used). Thus the 2–4 days of training period could be built in at the pre-study stage if the training period is relative lengthy for a short drug treatment during the study.</p>
<p>To ensure the accurate drug dosing and avoid injury caused by fighting over the jelly (particularly for male mice), the mice need to be individually housed during time of jelly presentation. This may present logistic challenge for studies that do not permit single housing and thus have to treat each mouse individually during jelly treatment. For this I have some suggestions under <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>.</p>
<p>One key for this method to be successful is that the drug is sufficiently palatable in flavored and sweetened vehicle. This may be challenging for drugs that have low solubility or strong unpleasant taste. I have included several potential solutions under <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>. However, for drugs that precipitate out at low temperature, i.e., at 4°C during the jelly setting period, this method would not be suitable. Furthermore, although we have not encountered this in any of current studies, mice may develop conditioned taste aversion and withdraw from voluntary jelly consumption if the drug elicits aversive side-effects. Thus, this voluntary dosing method would not be suitable for drugs that cause malaise.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem</h3>
<p>Drug has limited solubility and precipitates in drug solution.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Incorporate the amount of drug for 6 mice rather than 8 mice into 1 jelly, then give 1/6<sup>th</sup> the jelly to each mouse. Mice generally finish the entire piece of jelly in a single attempt; however, completion of the jelly consumption may take a little longer time.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem</h3>
<p>Drug has its own diluent with high viscosity and not readily mixes with water.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The drug can be masked into a flavored and sweetened paste using the instructed viscous vehicle instead of gelatin and give to the mice that have been trained to lick the paste from a small tray. The training protocol is essentially the same as that used for jelly, except a small tray containing 200 - 250 μL of flavored and sweetened paste rather than a piece of jelly being presented to mice. Mice will lick off the tray and finish this portion also in about 1 min as has been successfully applied in our study (<a href="#bib1">Cox et al., 2010</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem</h3>
<p>During the jelly training, mouse does not eat jelly within 30 min after jelly presentation.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Reasons for this problem could be that the mouse is disturbed by lab noise, or more neophobic than other mice. I suggest leaving the jelly in the cage while keeping the mouse fasted for another 0.5–2 h and monitor every 15 min. Refeed the mouse if the mouse eats the jelly within this period. If the mouse still does not eat the jelly, leave the jelly in the cage and refeed the mouse to avoid prolonged fasting. Monitor the mouse during the day. In current studies, the majority of mice that did not eat the jelly at fasting condition and had to be refed to avoid prolonged fasting ate the jelly by the end of the day.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem</h3>
<p>Mouse does not finish the entire piece of vehicle jelly in a single attempt.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This is likely due to the size of the jelly piece being too big for the mouse, e.g., young mice.</p>
<p>Give 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the jelly to the mouse. In this case, the amount of drug in the drug jelly to be used in later “treatment” stage needs to be re-calculated accordingly as explained in the note under: <a href="#before-you-begin">Before you begin</a>/Option 1/step 5d.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem</h3>
<p>Mouse eats vehicle jelly but not the drug jelly.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This may happen when the drug has strong adverse smell or taste. Potential solution is to increase the amount of flavoring essence in jelly, or use a different flavoring essence. If possible, reduce the drug dosage.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.11">Problem</h3>
<p>Mouse eats the drug jelly initially, then stops eating it.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The drug may have aversive side-effects and cause conditional taste aversion. Using a different flavoring essence may resume jelly consumption temporarily. Reduce the drug dosage if possible to reduce potential side-effects.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.13">Problem</h3>
<p>The study does not permit single housing mice that would allow for convenient jelly dosing for individual mouse.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>If the cage is sufficiently big, dividers (we made it from autoclaved cardboard) can be placed inside the cage during the jelly treatment time to sperate the mice to individual compartment. Place one piece of jelly per compartment and remove the dividers after all mice finished their jelly. This worked well for us in the setting of 2 mice per cage (cage size: 34.5 cm (L) × 11.5 cm (W) × 13.5 cm (H)). Using dividers that fit inside the cage and thus allow for the closure of cage lid helps since an open cage creates distractions and stress for mice.</p>
