<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Oral mucosal tissue is composed of several cell types that are difficult to dissociate while maintaining high cell viability. We describe a protocol for the preparation and dissociation of human buccal and gingival oral mucosal tissue to a high-viability single-cell suspension composed of heterogeneous cell types. This heterogeneous cell suspension can subsequently be used for cytometric analyses or to generate single-cell RNA sequencing libraries.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00614-6/sref2">Williams et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min</div>
<p>Oral mucosal biopsies (buccal mucosa 3–4 mm punch and/or gingival collar single sample ) are obtained by qualified clinicians under local anesthesia. Collected tissue samples are placed in a 2 mL Sarstedt tube containing 1 mL of RPMI 1640 (no FBS) on wet ice and transferred quickly (within 15–30 min) to the laboratory for processing.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol allows for successful isolation of all expected major oral mucosal cell types (<a href="#bib2">Williams et al., 2021</a>).</p>
<p>Successful dissociation/digestion should yield a viability of 75% or greater for optimal downstream application results. The cell number is dependent upon the size and health status of the tissue. 3–4 mm oral biopsies of healthy tissues will typically yield &gt;10K cells (10–40K, median 14K). For single cell sequencing the cDNA should yield a distinct peak between 300 bp and 10 kb.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol was only tested on buccal mucosa and gingiva and may need to be adapted for other mucosal sites.</p>
<p>All tissues tested were processed within 30 min of biopsy procedure, the protocol may yield different results if tissues are not processed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Red blood cell lysis may lead to a significant reduction in cell viability and/or count.</p>
<p>Use of a manual method utilizing the same enzyme yields lower cell count and viability.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Low cell viability after dissociation (&lt;75%) (step 17 )</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Timely processing of tissue after biopsy: Complete the tissue processing procedure as soon as possible following biopsy collection. Work with the surgeon to ensure the tissue is placed in the collection tube on wet ice and transferred immediately to the area where tissue dissociation will occur.</p>
<p>Adjustment of Red Blood Lysis steps: the protocol for red blood cell lysis can reduce cell viability. When preparing the tissue for mincing, wash away as much blood as possible with PBS to minimize the number of red blood cells in the final cell suspension.</p>
<p>Make all solutions fresh just prior to use.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Low cell count (step 17)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure incubator is set at 37°C prior to enzymatic digestion.</p>
<p>Ensure collagenase II is stored properly at 4°C and the tissue is completely minced prior to enzymatic and mechanical digestion.</p>
<p>Make all solutions fresh just prior to use.</p>
<p>The size of the tissue biopsy should be at least 3 mm in diameter (for either single cell library prep or flow cytometry). Healthy tissue biopsies will yield far fewer cells than diseased tissue biopsies of the same size. Adjust biopsy size when possible (&gt;3 mm punch biopsy used in this protocol).</p>
<p>Cells may stick to plasticware. Consider using plastic made of polypropylene, which minimizes cell binding to the side of tubes.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Clumps of cells, not single cells (step 17 )</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure DNase I has been added to digestion media.</p>
<p>After mechanical and enzymatic dissociation, thoroughly press any remaining tissue through the 70 μm cell strainer.Filter the sample immediately before loading onto the 10<b>×</b> controller.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>High red blood cell number in subsequent sequencing analysis (step 14 )</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>For future biopsy preparation, consider the following:</p>
<p>Prior to mincing the tissue, attempt to separate as much blood from the tissue as possible. Remove any large coagulates and if necessary, rinse tissue in several exchanges of PBS.</p>
<p>Reduce the number of red blood cells by using the optional red blood cell lysis step.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>High mitochondrial gene expression in subsequent sequencing analysis (step 15)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>High mitochondrial gene expression can be attributed to cells undergoing apoptosis and is used as a metric in assessing quality of single cell libraries. For future biopsy preparation, ensure that biopsies are processed in a timely manner, as cells within tissues start undergoing apoptosis quickly after biopsy procedure is completed.</p>
