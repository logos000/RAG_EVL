<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are emerging as critical regulators of memory-related neuronal processes. However, their exact contribution depends on type of memory, consolidation stage, or brain region, and remains to be fully investigated. We describe here a protocol to evaluate the importance of PNNs in the dorsal hippocampus in different stages of aversive memories using a mouse model. The protocol provides detailed instructions for surgical implantation of hippocampal cannulas, drug infusion, contextual fear conditioning procedures, and immunohistochemistry for PNN visualization.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00637-7/sref15">Jovasevic et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>PNNs are extracellular matrix (ECM) structures that surround the soma, the proximal and middle dendrites of neurons, often extending to include the axon initial segment (<a href="#bib7">Fawcett et al., 2019</a>). Emerging evidence shows that they are important for proper memory processing. Their involvement has been shown in several subcortical, (hippocampus, amygdala) and cortical (prefrontal, visual, auditory cortices) regions, and in a broad range of memory tasks, testing aversive and appetitive associative memory, or non-associative, recognition memory (<a href="#bib1">Banerjee et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib9">Gogolla et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib13">Hylin et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib20">Romberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib21">Santiago et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib22">Slaker et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib24">Thompson et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib27">Xue et al., 2014</a>). However, the exact stages of memory processing at which they are involved, and the mechanism through which they exert their activity, remain to be determined. Existing data on the role of PNNs in memory vary greatly, demonstrating both improvement (<a href="#bib17">Morellini et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib20">Romberg et al., 2013</a>) and impairment (<a href="#bib13">Hylin et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib24">Thompson et al., 2018</a>) of memory with PNN degradation, depending on the brain region in which PNNs are disrupted, timing of disruption, and behavioral task in which memory is tested. Additionally, various methods are used for PNN depletion, such as treatment with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) (<a href="#bib24">Thompson et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib27">Xue et al., 2014</a>), hyaluronidase (<a href="#bib23">Sun et al., 2018</a>), a combination of both (<a href="#bib13">Hylin et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib21">Santiago et al., 2018</a>), or genetic manipulations (<a href="#bib20">Romberg et al., 2013</a>). In order to define the role of PNNs in processes related to memory, it is essential to consistently apply standardized protocols in each experimental setting and to minimize variability across different experimental designs. We describe here a protocol for targeted disruption of PNNs in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) for the purpose of studying their role in the retrieval of aversive episodic-like memories at recent or remote stage, which we have used in our recent publication (<a href="#bib15">Jovasevic et al., 2021</a>). We have used this protocol for targeted delivery of other drugs into DH, and into other brain regions as well (<a href="#bib3">Corcoran et al., 2011</a>; <a href="#bib10">Guzman et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib14">Jovasevic et al., 2015</a>). The disruption of PNNs is achieved through the enzymatic degradation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), a major component of PNNs (<a href="#bib19">Reichelt et al., 2019</a>). Enzymatic degradation of PNNs provides higher temporal specificity than constitutive knockout of a PNN component, and does not run the risk of genetic compensation which can be observed with constitutive knockouts (<a href="#bib6">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</a>). This protocol involves infusion of ChABC into CA1 region of DH guided by a bilateral 26-gauge cannula, followed by behavioral training and testing. Enzymatic treatment is an often used approach for degradation of PNNs, typically with one of the two delivery methods: direct infusion during surgery (<a href="#bib24">Thompson et al., 2018</a>), or a cannula-guided method (<a href="#bib9">Gogolla et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib13">Hylin et al., 2013</a>). Infusion during surgery has several disadvantages that in our view makes this approach less suitable for applications with memory tasks. The procedure requires deep anesthesia, and longer recovery, therefore it is not suitable when drug infusions are required soon before memory training or test. The procedure also does not allow multiple infusions of a drug, or a combination of drugs. Although several published reports use cannula-guided ChABC delivery, none provide an in-depth description of the procedure, which is important considering that this procedure is used on mice or rats, and some steps are implemented differently between the two species. Here, we provide a detailed, easy to follow protocol for cannula implantation surgery, drug infusion, and contextual fear conditioning in mice. All procedures involving mice performed in our studies were approved by Northwestern University's Animal Care and Use Committee in compliance with US National Institutes of Health standards. The protocol requires several reagents and instruments to be prepared in advance.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Avertin (2, 2, 2-tribromoethanol) solution</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 12+ h</div>
<ol>
<li>Prepare a stock solution (1.6 g/mL) of avertin.
<ol type="a">
<li>Weigh 25 g of 2, 2, 2-tribromoethanol, add 15.625 mL tert-amyl alcohol.</li>
<li>Mix in a dark bottle at room temperature (20°C–22°C) to dissolve (∼12 h). Use either a magnetic stirrer or a shaker. Stock solution can be stored at room temperature for up to one year.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Prepare a working solution solution (14 mg/mL) of avertin. The volume depends on the number of mice that will undergo surgery. We would suggest 1 mL/mouse. Although quite less will be actually used, the extra volume allows for easier dispensing, particularly towards the end of the procedure.
<ol type="a">
<li>Add stock solution to an appropriate volume of 0.9% saline solution.</li>
<li>Mix thoroughly and vigorously, by vortexing or by using magnetic stirrer, in a dark or an aluminum foil-covered bottle.</li>
<li>Filter the solution though a 0.2-micron filter into a dark or foil covered container and store at 4°C. The working solution can be stored for a month; however, we would advise to prepare fresh working solution one day prior to use.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Occasionally 2, 2, 2-tribromoethanol will precipitate when saline is added to the stock solution, and can be very difficult to dissolve again. This can be prevented by incrementally adding small volumes (1 mL) of saline solution and vortexing after each addition. It is very important that all of 2, 2, 2-tribromoethanol is in the solution, otherwise proper level of anesthesia will not be achieved.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> We strongly suggest using avertin as anesthetic of choice, which we have reliably and reproducibly used for many years. Unlike isoflurane, avertin anesthesia lasts long enough for cement and cannulas to be well affixed to the skull, and it preserves the resting functional connectivity in the mouse brain better than isoflurane (<a href="#bib26">Xie et al., 2020</a>). If an alternative anesthetic is preferred, ketamine/xylazine also preserves the resting functional connectivity (<a href="#bib26">Xie et al., 2020</a>); however, in our experience anesthesia lasts a very long time, recovery is slower, and mortality is higher, possibly due to the more severe effects on cardiac function (<a href="#bib11">Hart et al., 2001</a>).</div>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Sterilization of cannulas and surgical instruments</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 2 h</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Put surgical instruments into an autoclave box. Put cannulas into a glass bottle with an airtight lid.</li>
<li>Autoclave at 121°C for 30 min, dry for 30 min.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> Close the bottle with cannulas only once it has somewhat cooled. If it is closed while still hot, it will be very difficult to open it later.</div>

<h3 id="sec4.1">Stereotaxic surgery—cannulation</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 day (15–20 min/mouse)</div>
<p>The purpose of this step is to implant and affix cannulas for intrahippocampal delivery. Stereotaxic coordinates for the dorsal hippocampus are 1.8 mm posterior, ±1.0 mm lateral and 2.0 mm ventral to bregma, according to the mouse brain atlas (<a href="#bib8">Franklin and Paxinos, 2013</a>). In comparison to drug delivery via microsyringe infusions, this approach has several advantages: it allows for multiple drug deliveries and requires a much shorter recovery time (20 min, vs several days for microsyringe infusions). All steps below are repeated for each mouse. For our experiments we use 9-week-old male C57BL/6N mice (Envigo). Please follow your institutional guidelines on aseptic and analgesic managements during and after the surgery.</p>
<ol>
<li>Anesthetize mouse.
<ol type="a">
<li>Weigh the animal.</li>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 h</div>
<p>This step of the protocol is designed to train the mice in a behavioral paradigm, to acquire an aversive memory, and to determine the strength of the memory in subsequent tests. The protocol uses contextual fear conditioning as a model for aversive episodic memories (<a href="#bib18">Radulovic et al., 1998</a>). This task is particularly suitable for studying long-lasting episodic memories in mouse models due to their hippocampal dependence and their robust and enduring behavioral manifestation (freezing). Contextual fear conditioning is performed in a plexiglass cage, with a stainless-steel rod floor (4 mm diameter, 0.9 cm center to center), within a constantly illuminated box, fitted with a camera to monitor and record the session (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A). Fear conditioning consists of a single 3-min exposure to a context followed by a 2 s, 0.8 mA footshock (constant current). A test for freezing behavior is performed by re-exposing the mice to the box for 3 min. The freezing response, horizontal activity, exploratory activity, and shock bursts are determined. Freezing should be recorded by trained observers unaware of the experimental conditions while all other data are provided automatically by software analyzing the infrared beam signals from the context. The shock is mildly aversive and causes the mice to either jump or run during its presentation. It is important to use different groups of mice for each experimental condition (vehicle/ChABC, recent/remote memory). Testing the same group of mice for recent and remote memory creates a concern of a possible effect of reconsolidation or fear extinction on the outcome of the remote memory test.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>In this protocol we describe steps for targeted disruption of PNNs in CA1 region of DH for the purpose of evaluating their role in the processing of recent and remote aversive memories in this region. Infusion of ChABC into CA1 should result in complete degradation of PNNs 5 days later. Even if some occasional PNNs remain, they are structurally compromised, and typically appear as a faint ring surrounding only soma (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A). The earliest time point at which we tested the efficiency of PNN degradation was 5 days after ChABC infusion. If an experimental design requires a memory test at a time point earlier than 5 days, we recommend a test experiment to determine whether PNN degradation is achieved at that time point. During contextual fear conditioning training phase mice should be freely exploring the entire context (<a href="#mmc1">Methods video S1</a>, <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>A) and their locomotor activity should not differ between the experimental and control groups (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B). During the presentation of the footshock mice show an outburst of locomotion (typically running and jumping), accompanied by vocalization. This heightened locomotor activity should not differ among the groups (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B). The contextual fear conditioning protocol described here produces long-lasting memory (over 3 months) in control group, manifested as freezing responses (<a href="#mmc2">Methods video S2</a>, <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>B). We typically observe about 50% time spent freezing. In the control group, this memory can be retrieved at both recent and remote phases (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>C). Freezing levels will vary from experiment to experiment [in our hands typically 40%–60% (<a href="#bib28">Yamawaki et al., 2019</a>)]; therefore, only groups from the same experiment should be compared. In contrast to the control group, the PNN-depleted group shows a distinct pattern of memory responses. In recent test, memory is intact, while in remote test it is strongly impaired (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>C).</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>Contextual fear conditioning testing consisted of 3 min exposure to the conditioning context, during which freezing was measured every 10 s. Freezing was expressed as a percentage of the total number of observations during which the mice were motionless (freezing observations, FO) using formula FO/18∗100. Locomotor activity is recorded automatically by an infrared beam system and expressed as mean velocity (cm/s).</p>
<p>We perform statistical analyses using GraphPad Prism software; however, any other comparable software can be used instead (e.g., IBM SPSS Statistics). Only those mice with PNNs that are completely degraded, or structurally compromised, (as described in Expected outcomes) in CA1 should be considered for the analyses. The results are analyzed using two-way ANOVA with group (vehicle or ChABC) and time length as factors. Homogeneity of variance is confirmed with Levene's test for equality of variances. When significant main and interaction effects are observed, two-way ANOVA is followed by Sidak’s multiple comparison test. All comparisons are conducted using two-tailed tests and the p value for all cases is set to &lt;0.05 for significant differences. Group sizes are determined using power analysis assuming a moderate effect size of 0.5.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>There are several possible limitations to the experimental protocol that should be taken into consideration, or kept in mind if this protocol is to be modified:</p>
<p>Behavioral tests can be affected by external environmental factors such as loud noises, vibrations in the building, smells, etc. Any exposure to such stressful stimuli can result in various abnormal behaviors, such as freezing during training (before footshock presentation), lack of freezing or extreme freezing (approaching 100%) during the test. In such cases the experiment should be repeated with a new set of mice. If possible, the behavioral equipment should be placed in a well-controlled environment, with minimal disturbances. Any environmental abbreviations should be noted during the experiment.</p>
<p>ChABC degrades CSPGs, a major constituent of PNNs (<a href="#bib4">Deepa et al., 2006</a>), and therefore allows a general assessment of the role of PNNs, but cannot be used to determine the role of individual components of PNNs, which are known to have unique roles (<a href="#bib7">Fawcett et al., 2019</a>). In order to precisely define the role of PNNs in memory it will be required to conduct studies with specific manipulations, targeting individual components of PNNs. However, this is likely to be challenging as well because the constituents of PNNs also play other roles in the organization of the extracellular matrix (<a href="#bib2">Bukalo et al., 2001</a>; <a href="#bib5">Edamatsu et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib12">Hirono et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p>Our approach for PNN detection uses Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) staining. While the majority of PNNs are WFA-positive, there are also WFA-negative PNNs, such as those surrounding cortical output neurons (<a href="#bib16">Matthews et al., 2002</a>). Although this is not a concern for our experimental protocol, considering it examines PNNs in the hippocampus, it is important to keep in mind for studies of other brain regions.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec8.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>PNN degradation in a wrong brain region (Step 3)</p>
<p>This problem occurs when cannulas are misplaced. This is rarely a problem for DH and other large brain regions, but could be an important confound when smaller areas are targeted. There are several possible reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Centering scope and/or drill are not properly aligned. This would result in a consistent shift in the coordinates and cannula position.</p>
<p>(2) Inexperienced experimenter. Typically, the source of the problem is that a person new to the procedure is not able to reliably identify bregma. This results in a high proportion of misplaced cannulas, with random shifts in the position.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>(1) Verify that the centering scope and the drill are properly aligned with each other. Once the scope is centered on bregma, fit the stereotaxic instrument with the drill, and lower it until the top of the drill bit touches the skull. The drill bit should also be positioned at bregma. Use a magnifying glass if necessary. If this is not the case, realign the instrument. We would advise that any repairs to the stereotaxic instrument are performed by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>(2) Re-training should be implemented until the experimenter is confident in all steps of the procedure, and can reliably perform it, with correctly placed cannula.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>PNN degradation is not observed throughout the entire CA1, or extends into surrounding regions (Step 7)</p>
<p>This problem arises when the infusion volume is too small or too large, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Adjust the volume of ChABC that is infused until PNNs are degraded in the entire CA1, but not in the regions neighboring the CA1.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Enzymatic degradation of PNNs was not successful/incomplete (Step 8)</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons:</p>
<p>(1) ChABC lost its activity. This a likely reason when the degradation of PNNs was not achieved in CA1 of both hemispheres.</p>
<p>(2) ChABC was not infused into DH. If PNNs were degraded in DH on one side, but not the other, a very likely reason is that the injector was clogged during the infusion.</p>
<p>(3) Guide cannulas are plugged, resulting in damage to the injector.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>(1) Use a freshly prepared solution of ChABC. Always store the solution at −80°C, in small aliquots to avoid repeated thawing/freezing.</p>
<p>(2) Carefully monitor the movement of the air bubbles in the tubing during the infusion. Mark the start and end position with a fine marker. If one side of the injector is clogged, the bubble will not move from its start position. If the injector is clogged, replace with a new one.</p>
<p>(3) Clean guide cannulas carefully after every use. Remove cement from the outside of the guide cannula. If needed, using a fine wire (or an old dummy cannula), clean the inside of the guide cannula to remove any traces of cement. Put the guide and dummy cannulas into distilled water with a few drops of liquid soap and sonicate for 15 min. Rinse the cannulas several times with distilled water, and once with 70% ethanol. Leave to dry completely before autoclaving.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>No response to electric shock during conditioning (Step 11)</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Treatment (pharmacological, surgical) rendered the mouse unresponsive. This issue is typically not observed when using ChABC; however, it does occasionally occur with other pharmacological manipulations. We observed this problem with intrahippocampal applications of extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R agonist gaboxadol, which at higher doses produces impairing effects on locomotor activity (<a href="#bib14">Jovasevic et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p>(2) The electric circuit was disrupted.</p>
<p>(3) Shock threshold is increased. We have never encountered this problem, but if this happens it may be due to impaired shock sensitivity in some genetic mouse lines.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>(1) Adjust the dose of the drug so it would still have desired pharmacological effect, but without deleterious effects on locomotor activity. As we mentioned, this typically does not occur with ChABC, but in an unlikely scenario that a very high dose is used which results in impaired locomotor activity, the dose should be gradually reduced so it produces desired depletion of PNNs, but without differences in locomotor activity between vehicle and ChABC groups (as illustrated in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B).</p>
<p>(2) Frequently, the cause of disrupted electrical circuit is mouse feces that bridges two floor bars, resulting in short circuit. In this case, carefully open the door of the fear conditioning chamber and clean the bars, disturbing the mouse as little as possible. Once the bars are cleaned run a “shock only” program in the fear conditioning system (which should be programmed in advance), consisting of only 2 s, 0.8 mA shock.</p>
<p>(3) Increase footshock intensity after careful titration from 0.8 to 1.5 mA until a response to shock can be observed (outburst of locomotion, vocalization). We would not recommend increasing the shock intensity above 1.5 mA.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Lack of freezing in control group at recent memory test (Step 12)</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this:</p>
<p>(1) Mouse did not receive a footshock at the end of the training session.</p>
<p>(2) Mouse was under the influence of stressful environmental factors that impaired its normal physiological responses to the footshock or the ability to associate context with the footshock.</p>
<h3 id="sec8.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>(1) Observe animals carefully during the training session. When the footshock is administered animals should display increased locomotion and vocalization. Additionally, the reaction to footshock can also be confirmed based on the recorded locomotor activity data (see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B). If the mouse is not reacting to the shock, apply one of the solutions to Problem 3. Additionally, if the absence of the footshock was observed after all animals were trained or tested, they can be trained again. However, in that case the results should be cautiously interpreted, since the unplanned exposure to the context, without a footshock, deviates from the standard protocol. The data could be useful and informative; however, the experiment should be repeated, with a new set of animals.</p>
<p>(2) Avoid any potential sources of stress that can be controlled (e.g., cell phone ringing, loud talking, wearing perfume, maintenance or construction work nearby, etc.). If these problems do occur, repeat the experiment with a new set of animals, after the environmental factors causing the problem have been removed.</p>
