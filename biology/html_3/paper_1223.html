<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The adrenal gland consists of two tissues, cortex and medulla, united under one capsule. Adrenal stem/progenitor cells play a key role in development and homeostasis. Here, we describe a protocol for generating primary cultures of adrenal cells from mice. We describe techniques for separating the cortex and medulla, generating spheroid cultures containing stem- and progenitor cells, and for the differentiation into steroidogenic and chromaffin cells, respectively. This protocol enables analysis of various treatments before, during, or after differentiation.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00705-X/sref6">Rubin de Celis et al.

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol is focused on the isolation and differentiation of adrenocortical and adrenomedullary stem cells and progenitors from Nestin-GFP mice. However, the protocol can also be used for isolation of other adrenal cells and from other mouse strains, where the cells are not fluorescently labelled. The protocol provides different experimental conditions and final assessments that might not all be required by the experimental design pertinent to the addressed question. Please refer to the flow-chart (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) to define which experimental design will be suitable for your specific question. For example, if you have no interest in stem- and progenitor cells, it is possible to culture isolated and fully differentiated cells by skipping step 3 (proliferation) (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>

<p>The chart shows the full protocol, which however can be used for individual purposes: (1) isolation of adrenals, (2) separation of the adrenal into cortex and medulla, (3) spheroid culture of stem-like cells, (4) differentiation into mature adrenal cells.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Before you start the isolation of adrenal cells, be aware that you need to have permission to perform animal experiments. In our case, all animal experiments were approved by the Regional Council of Saxony (Landesdirektion Sachsen) according to German animal welfare regulations (Licence TVA 17/2017).</p>
<p>We normally isolate adrenal cells from around 10 mice from both sexes per experiment, where all cells are pooled after separation into cortex and medulla, respectively. However, it is also possible to use the protocol for less or more mice.</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The medium containing FBS, L-Glutamine and Antibiotic-Antimycotic can be stored at 4°C for up to 1 week. bFGF should be added fresh and the final solution should be used immediately. Since all reagents are cell culture tested and sterile, it is not necessary to filter them. The DMEM/F12 medium already contains L-Glutamine but because of its instability and the long-term culture, additional L-Glutamine should be supplied to the culture medium. To avoid different growth patterns with changing FBS batches, we use FBS superior. In this serum, growth-promoting compounds are supplemented to get a more consistent FBS. Thereby, we never experienced culture differences. We have also tested serum-free alternatives such as neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% B27 (Gibco). However, here the cells grow much slower and the morphology is changed. Both media contain high concentrations of glucose (17.5–25 mM) and we have not tested whether low glucose concentrations (&lt;6 mM) influence the growth.</div>

These protocols do not contain procedures for spheroid cultures and subsequent differentiation, however, they contain videos that might improve the visualization of the separation into cortex and medulla (<a href="#bib3">Chen and Huang, 2019</a>; <a href="#bib4">Kolski-Andreaco et al., 2007</a>).</div>

<p>This protocol is for isolation and culture of adrenal cells from both cortex and medulla. Using this protocol, you can test your treatment of interest either during the proliferation (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) or differentiation process (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>) or when cells are fully differentiated (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>).</p>

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 7. Adrenal cell differentiation</div>
<p>After at least 6 days of proliferation, cells are transferred to adherence conditions, where they will start to differentiate. 3 h after transfer, cells have started to adhere and proliferating cells can be identified by EdU-staining. After 7 days of differentiation (day 14), cells have spread out from the spheroids. Furthermore, most cells have lost their expression of Nestin and become positive for differentiation markers such as StAR (cortex) and tyrosine hydroxylase (medulla). Scale bars, 100 µm.</p>

<p>Amount of cells expected: From one C57BL/6 mouse (2 adrenals), 50–100.000 cells are normally isolated from the medulla, and 500.000–1.000.000 cells are isolated from the cortex. These numbers depend on the age of the mouse and the sex, as adrenals from female mice are bigger than those from males (<a href="#bib1">Bechmann et al., 2021a</a>). The protocol has not been tested with other mouse strains.</p>
<p>The proliferation of the cultured cells can be examined during both the proliferation and the differentiation phase using EdU staining as described by the manufacturer (<a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/C10340">https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/C10340</a>). The expression of different stem- and progenitor cell markers, such as <i>Nestin</i>, <i>Gli1</i>, and <i>Shh</i>, in the spheroids can be investigated using quantitative RT-PCR. For primer details, please see <a href="#bib7">Steenblock et al. (2018)</a>. After 1 week in culture, the spheroids reach their final size with an average of ∼100 μm in diameter.</p>
<p>The isolated and cultivated cells from the adrenal cortex show steroidogenic properties. The expression of steroidogenic markers, e.g., StAR, SF-1, CYP11A1, or CYP11B2, can be examined at the RNA level by quantitative RT-PCR or at the protein level by immunofluorescence staining. For details of antibodies and primers, please refer to (<a href="#bib7">Steenblock et al., 2018</a>). Furthermore, the secretion of steroids into the cell culture medium can be measured using ELISA or mass spectrometry (<a href="#bib7">Steenblock et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib8">Werdermann et al., 2021</a>).</p>
<p>The isolated and cultivated cells from the adrenal medulla differentiate into chromaffin cells, glial cells, and neurons. The expression of stem-/ progenitor markers such as Nestin, or markers for more differentiated cell phenotypes such as Chromogranin A, Tyrosine hydroxylase, and β-tubulin can be examined by isolating RNA for quantitative RT-PCR or at the protein level by immunofluorescence staining. For details of antibodies and primers, please refer to <a href="#bib6">Rubin de Celis et al. (2015)</a> and <a href="#bib7">Steenblock et al. (2018)</a>. Catecholamine production in the cells can be measured using mass spectrometry as described previously (<a href="#bib2">Bechmann et al., 2021b</a>). In our experience, the medullary cells divide and grow faster than the cortical cells (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The amount of cells achieved per adrenal and their ability to generate spheroids depends on the age of the mice. In our experience, the diameter of the spheroids is smaller when adrenal cells are isolated from older mice. Therefore, we normally use 8-week old mice and definitely mice younger than 8 months.</p>
<p>The cortex and the medulla are manually separated under the microscope. Here, it is impossible to reach 100% purity, and especially for the medulla, there will always be some adrenocortical cells attached to the medulla. However, as most stem- and progenitor cells in the adrenal cortex are located directly under the adrenal capsule and in the outer zona Glomerulosa, this usually does not influence the results.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Cortex and medulla are not separated properly (steps 22–23).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It takes some training to peel the cortex and separate the medulla properly. If the adrenal is cut, take your eyes on it and try not to damage the medulla while peeling off the cortex.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Many cells have died during the procedure (steps 24–34).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is important to work as fast as possible to avoid that the cells spend too much time in just PBS. Furthermore, for the adrenal medulla it is very important that the dissociation into single cells is stopped after 20 min in the digestion buffer. The cortical cells are more robust and can stay for up to 30 min in the digestion buffer without dying. Furthermore, in order to increase the viability, it is important to always place the cells on ice whenever possible.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Bacterial or fungal contamination (step 37).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Spray 80% ethanol on the fur of the mouse before opening the abdomen. Use sterile instruments and sterile PBS. Clean the instruments in between with 80% ethanol. Start working under the laminar flow as soon as the cortex and the medullary cells are separated.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Impurities in the medium may give rise to aggregations of cells at these impurities (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>; step 37).</p>
<figure id="fig8"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1223-Fig8.jpg" alt="Fig8.jpg">

<p>(B) Cells aggregate at impurities in the medium (e.g., mouse hair) and several smaller spheroids are generated. Scale bar, 100 µm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Cells and solutions are filtered but sometimes small impurities such as mouse hairs end up in the culture plates anyway. Make sure that you work as clean as possible.</p>
