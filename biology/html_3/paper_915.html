<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol enables correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) imaging of cell surface features without using dedicated equipment. Cells are cultured and fixed on transparent substrates for confocal microscopy imaging. No conductive coating is employed in the scanning electron microscopy workflow, providing a clean cell surface observation, with fiducial markers assisting alignment of optical and topographical images. This protocol describes CLEM imaging for midbody remnants in MDCK cells but can also be applied to different cell types and surface features.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib2">Casares-Arias et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>To be identified under the confocal microscope, the biological structures must be labeled with fluorescent molecules prior to imaging. Immunofluorescence labeling protocols, widely used in the field, usually include a permeabilization step that leads to ultrastructural detail loss, rendering the use of antibodies unsuitable for a CLEM approach. Therefore, in order to localize and analyze the structures of interest, fluorescent fusion proteins or similar approaches, such as click chemistry (SNAP/HALO-tag), must be used.</p>
<p>This protocol can be applied to different cell types and surface features. In the examples included to illustrate the protocol, a MDCK cell line stably expressing two different fluorescent fusion proteins has been used. For further details, please refer to (<a href="#bib2">Casares-Arias et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<h3 id="sec2.1">Confocal microscopy</h3>
<p>Images were captured using a 60× water objective (NA 1.2) on a Nikon A1R+ confocal microscope. 488 and 561 nm laser lines were used to image the fluorescent fusion proteins, 640 nm laser line was used on reflection mode to image the gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). Specific acquisition parameters for each image set are detailed on the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Additional tracks, such a transmitted light, can also be acquired during confocal imaging.</div>
<h3 id="sec2.2">Scanning electron microscopy</h3>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired with a Field Emission SEM FEI (now Thermo Scientific) Verios 460. High-end recent SEMs, as this model, are able to provide high resolution in the very low voltage (VLV) range (≤ 1 nm at 1 kV). This has allowed us to image uncoated biological samples on glass substrates.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Though we strongly recommend the use of VLV-SEM to avoid the need of coating the samples with conductive layers, the protocol can be adapted to allow the utilization of more conventional SEM equipment (see <a href="#sec6.1">troubleshooting 1</a>: Using Alternative SEM without VLV capabilities).</div>
<p>The imaging of uncoated biological samples has the advantage of reducing possible artifacts in the observed morphology due to the deposited layer. However, the reduced conductivity of the samples induces charging effects that degrade the image quality and therefore have to be minimized. The use of VLV is a first strategy to achieve this. Additional methods include the use of very short dwell times (50–100 ns). To maximize the signal to noise ratio in these conditions, frame integration scanning modes need to be used (around 100–200 frames per image are recommended), with software-based drift correction option activated (if this option is not available, charge-originated drift may destroy the quality of image after frame integration). Particular acquisition parameters for each image set are specified on the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a> section.</p>
<p>Most SEM systems providing high resolution at very low voltages have implemented the option of applying beam deceleration (<a href="#bib6">Zarraoa et al., 2019</a>). This method consists in applying a negative bias voltage (typically 0.5–4 kV) to the sample holder in order to decelerate the incident beam before reaching the sample surface. As a consequence, the effective beam landing energy equals the column acceleration voltage (which is kept relatively high −from 2 to 5 kV− for optimum column performance and resolution) minus the sample bias. The resulting electric field between the pole piece and the sample acts as an additional electrostatic lens that reduces the beam diameter and enhances secondary electron (SE) collection at the detector placed inside the column –also called in-lens detector– improving spatial resolution. The SE and back-scattered electrons are also spatially redistributed by this electric field and the amount of SE more pathologically affected by charge effects that are collected by the detector is reduced. Therefore, the use of beam deceleration can improve both the image resolution and the charge management.</p>

<p>Large FOV SEM image (A) is compared to its confocal counterpart (contrast-enhanced) (B). The contours originated by the cell colonies (dotted lines in all panels) serve as navigation cues and allow to unequivocally find the same imaging area using different imaging techniques. Occasional imperfections in the sample, such as the dirt fiber shown in the top-left of A and B panels, can also facilitate orientation and alignment process. This allows the localization of the mid-FOV imaging areas (C and D) (magenta boxes on panels A and B) containing the structure of interest. The pattern formed by the Au NPs on the substrate (arrowheads on panels C and D) is used to localize the structures of interest on the SEM (blue box in C). Once the surface feature of interest has been localized on the mid-FOV SEM image, the small-FOV (E) and tilt images (F) can be acquired. Magenta dotted boxes in C and D correspond to the regions aligned in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> and represented after alignment on <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>.</p>

<li>Using the look-up map, start identifying the sections of interest in the sample. Acquire medium-FOV (100 μm wide, around 1,000×) images (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C). Dwell times in the range of 100–300 ns are appropriate here. The imaged area should be equivalent to the medium-FOV confocal microscopy images obtained in step 15 (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>D). Areas of the substrate showing the Au NPs must remain visible. For the medium-FOV images the in-lens secondary electrons detector is preferable to the in-chamber one as it provides better resolution.
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Depending on the size of the structures of interest, higher resolution images, in terms of pixels, might be needed at this point.

At these high magnifications, low-dwell times (50–100 ns) will be mandatory to reduce charge effects.

<p>After image acquisition, correlation, and alignment, the final result is an ImageJ hyperstack containing the medium-FOV confocal image aligned to the medium and small-FOV SEM images (<a href="#fig7">Figures 7</a>A–7C). This provides a topographical image of the cell membrane structure of interest with nanometric-range resolution, together with the multi-labeling protein localization data acquired through confocal microscopy. Additionally, and if tilt images were generated during SEM imaging, the feature of interest can also be observed from multiple angles (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>F).</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Due to the different environmental conditions required for confocal and scanning electron microscopy imaging, dehydration and drying must be carried out in between both imaging methods (steps 23–25). It has been previously reported that drying of biological samples, regardless of the methodology used, decreases cell volume (<a href="#bib3">Katsen-Globa et al., 2016</a>). On a CLEM workflow, this results in a slight misalignment of the resulting images. Though fiducial markers over the substrate remain immotile, making alignment possible, the small movements of the cell surface due to shrinking could modify to some extent the localization of the structures of interest (see <a href="#sec6.9">troubleshooting 5</a>: Image alignment).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Using Alternative SEM without VLV capabilities</p>
<p>In this protocol, a scanning electron microscope capable of achieving subnanometric resolution under very low voltage (VLV) conditions has been used. This allows the analysis of uncoated biological samples on glass substrates, reducing sample manipulation and delivering the highest possible resolution. If a conventional SEM microscope without VLV capabilities is used, charging effects will appear during imaging (steps 27 and 28).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Coating of the sample with a conductive material (such as gold, platinum or carbon) would minimize charging effects and allow the usage of higher beam voltages. However, this would be achieved at the expense of the level of detail in the final image, since the conductive layer will even out the finest structural details of the sample, potentially hiding relevant features. The coating should be done after sample dehydration and drying (subsequent to step 25). Deposition of a thin conductive coating, between 2 and 15 nm, by means of a physical vapor deposition technique should be enough. The thickness of the coating needs to be adjusted to allow the visualization of the Au nanoparticles.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Use of confluent cultures</p>
<p>The proposed methodology for CLEM imaging strongly relies on the existence of large-scale patterns on the sample, such as the overall shape of the cell colonies, to localize the imaging area and perform an initial rough alignment. A confluent cell monolayer after the cell culture phase (step 9) looks homogeneous under low-magnification conditions, preventing the direct application of this protocol.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>In order to introduce a higher degree of physical confinement for the cells, while maintaining orientation cues inside the sample, micro-patterned substrates could be used.</p>
<p>Another possibility is the creation of a large-scale pattern on the sample after fixation by scratching out portions of the cell monolayer. This process, however, damages the cells right at the border of the pattern, which is the area where the alignment strategy works best.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Confocal dataset tracing</p>
<p>Once the confocal large-FOV image has been acquired and the candidate features identified, the proposed methodology relies on the use of a motorized sample stage for repositioning during medium-FOV images acquisition (steps 15 and 16). In the absence of a motorized sample stage, or if the navigation cues present in the sample are too complex, this process might be challenging.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>In this case, the use of gridded coverslips (Mattek, Cat#P35G-1.5-14-CGRD) may be of help. The squared pattern embedded on the substrate, together with the alphanumeric code that identifies each square, allows to localize each medium-FOV image for look-up map elaboration. For this, an additional transmitted-light track has to be acquired during confocal imaging, as to make the pattern visible in the final images.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Charging during SEM imaging</p>
<p>During SEM imaging (steps 27 and 28) of non-conductive samples, the accumulation of negative charges on the specimen surface causes strong contrast variations in the image or drift, precluding the obtention of good quality images.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We recommend adapting the SEM imaging conditions as follows, with each step providing a higher level of complexity.</p>
<p>1. Keep the voltage at 1 kV but reduce the beam current.</p>
<p>2. Keep beam voltage at 1 kV and beam current at 13 pA (or lower beam current if desired), and apply beam deceleration (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> section). A typical value for the sample bias to employ is 1000 V.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Beam deceleration strategies should be applied too if the image quality at 1 kV is too low.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The use of beam deceleration strategies usually prevents the option of tilt imaging.</div>
<p>3. Reduce beam voltage at 500 V and keep beam current at 13 pA (or lower beam current if desired). Beam deceleration is usually mandatory in this case to obtain high resolution images at this very low voltage. A typical value for the sample bias voltage to be applied is 1500 V.</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> These softer conditions (options 1, 2 and 3) can also be useful for preventing damage of the structures.</div>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Image alignment</p>
<p>Dehydration and drying procedures carried out between confocal and SEM imaging (steps 23–25) may cause subtle deformations of the cell surface due to shrinking. Since the Au NPs are directly attached to the substrate, and thus unaffected by these deformations, there might be a slight shift in the position of the features of interest when confocal and SEM images are compared after alignment (step 41).</p>
<p>Additionally, the proposed methodology is optimized for the analysis of features that are relatively close to areas with exposed substrate, since alignment accuracy decreases with distance.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Image alignment precision can be improved, and its application range extended by applying the Au NPs directly on top of the cell surface prior to fixation (step 10). This way, the Au NPs would be affected by the deformation of the cell surface at the same extent as the features of interest, allowing its compensation. This alternative approach would also allow the correlative analysis of features that are far from exposed substrate areas.</p>
<p>Though the vast majority of the protocol would be unaffected by this modification, the final image alignment process should be modified to include the movement of the Au NPs between imaging methods. While the proposed methodology uses only translation, rotation and scaling to achieve alignment (step 36), elastic deformation (“Affine” on TrakEM2) of one of the datasets might be needed to compensate the movement of Au NPs placed on top of the cells.</p>
