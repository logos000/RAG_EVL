<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The preservation of mammalian freeze-dried (FD) spermatozoa is commonly performed using small glass ampules; however, they are bulky and breakable. In this study, we present a protocol to prepare and preserve mouse FD sperm using thin plastic sheets. This approach allows storing thousands of mouse strains in a card folder. We can also send the FD sperm domestically using a postcard without any extra equipment.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00639-0/sref3">Ito et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>We need mammalian sperm preservation technology in many fields, for example, maintenance of a huge mouse strains that increase every day. Freeze-drying technique is one of the methods to preserve the mammalian sperm (<a href="#bib6">Wakayama and Yanagimachi, 1998</a>) and do not use liquid nitrogen (LN<sub>2</sub>) or ultra-deep freezer during preservation (<a href="#bib4">Kamada et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib7">Wakayama et al., 2021</a>). However, the conventional method using ampoules was not suitable for storing or transporting because the ampoules were made with glass and they were breakable, expensive, and bulky.</p>
<p>This is a workflow to prepare and store mouse freeze-dried (FD) sperm in thin plastic sheets instead of glass ampoules.</p>
<p>As demonstration, in this protocol, Institute of cancer Research (ICR) male mice (10–12 weeks of age), and C57BL/6NCrSlc × C3H/HeSlc (B6C3F1) male mice (8–10 weeks of age) were obtained from SLC Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Committee of Laboratory Animal Experimentation of the University of Yamanashi, which is followed in the ARRIVE guideline everything.</p>
<p>The rough estimates of the time required for the entire process are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Preparation of weighing paper and plastic sheet</h3>
<p>Cut the weighing paper and plastic sheet in appropriate sizes (please see below).</p>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Preparation of FD sperm in plastic sheets</h3>
<p>Collect sperm from mature mice (after 3 months of age). The freezing takes only 10 min, but the vacuum-drying process lasts for 6 h. The FD sperm placed on the weighing paper are then sealed in glued plastic sheets.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Preservation</h3>
<p>FD sperm of many different mouse strains can be preserved in a card folder for more than three months at −30°C.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.4">Transport</h3>
<p>Attach the sheet containing FD sperm on the postcard in the same way you would put a stamp on it.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.5">Rehydration of FD sperm to prepare sperm injections for oocytes</h3>
<p>FD sperm pellet are picked up from inside the sheet and added into 50 μL of distilled water at ambient temperature.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.6">Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and embryo transfer (ET)</h3>
<p>ICSI and ET techniques are well established and require skilled execution. Please refer to other sources for their protocols.</p>

<h2 id="materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</h2>
<p>The weighing paper was purchased from SOGO Laboratories (Glass works co., Ltd.). Plastic sheets were purchased from Acco brands Japan K.K.. This protocol uses FreeZone® 2.5 L Benchtop Freeze Dryer (Labconco, MO, USA) for vacuum drying. The quality of liquid nitrogen is that can be used for sample storage or medical. We used the Styrofarm box, which size was (w) 275 × (d) 195 × (h) 210 mm, respectively. Ordinary Styrofoam can be used as an alternative according to the preferred size of the experimenter. HTF medium was also used for sperm suspension and it was compounded in our laboratory. These materials and equipment are listed on Key resources table. Make sure the required materials and equipment are ready to use.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The DNA integrity of FD sperm preserved using this protocol is comparable to that of the conventional method using a glass ampoule. The FD sperm sealed in the plastic sheets remain the developmental ability after three months preservation at −30°C. FD sperm transported using a postcard domestically within 3 days can also be used for ICSI. The offspring rate was not compromised after mailing, and healthy pups were obtained after performing ET at 2-cell stage. These results have been published in iScience (<a href="#bib3">Ito et al., 2021</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Even though FD sperm stored in plastic sheets at −30°C remain viable for more than three months, the storage at 15°C–25°C was limited to three days.</p>
<p>ICSI and ET into recipient female are required to generate offspring from FD sperm but they are very common method. The outlines of the ICSI and ET are listed below.</p>
<p>Before ICSI, 1–2 μL of the rehydrated sperm suspension was directly added into the drop of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the microinjection chamber immediately for microinjection. Apply piezo pulses to separate the sperm head from the tail and then inject the head into the oocyte. The next day of ICSI, ET was performed at the 2-cell stage to 0.5-day pseudo-pregnant ICR female mice mated with a vasectomized male the night before the transfer. The offspring can be delivered naturally or by cesarean section on 18.5 days after gestation and allowed to mature (<a href="#bib2">Ito et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Refer to Behringer et al. (2014) for the detailed protocol for ICSI and ET (<a href="#bib1">Behringer et al., 2014</a>).</div>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The sperm suspension spread on the weighing paper when you start freezing it and do not freeze properly (step 4a).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is recommended that the surface of LN<sub>2</sub> should be shallow in the Styrofoam; otherwise, the sperm suspension is not frozen well due to the outer air.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Formation of frost around the frozen sperm drops (steps 4b and 5).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The frost will sublimate, leaving the FD sperm and thus will not create any problems.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>FD sperm fall off from the weighing paper during vacuum drying (steps 5c and 5d).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Place a tube stand under the aluminum sheet to decrease the impact of the vibration during drying.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The FD sperm dislocate due to wind pressure when removed from the vacuum dryer (step 6b).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Place another weighing paper on the FD sperm and press it lightly with tweezers before removing the sheets slowly.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The FD sperm are too sticky to inject into oocytes after rehydration, or the zygotes derived from FD sperm do not develop into pronuclei or 2-cell stages after ICSI.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This could happen if the sheets are not sealed well and excess air remains between them, or the FD sperm are moist before they are placed in the plastic sheets as they are not sealed in plastic sheets immediately after drying. Please remove excess air while sealing the FD sperm (step 6d) or shorten the time between the end of vacuum drying process and the placing of the sperm between the sheets (step 6).</p>
