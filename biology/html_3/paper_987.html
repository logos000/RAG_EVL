<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol describes an <i>in vitro</i> fluorogenic assay to measure the proteolytic activity and identify inhibitors of M<sup>pro</sup>, the main protease produced by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Studies to identify potential inhibitors of M<sup>pro</sup> mainly rely on <i>in silico</i> molecular dynamics simulations or on FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) substrates. The protocol is based on an aminomethyl coumarin substrate. High sensitivity, specificity, and an easily detectable fluorescent read-out are the advantages offered by this rapid assay, which allows high throughput screening of new M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors.</p>

<p>This protocol details an <i>in vitro</i> fluorogenic assay to measure the activity of the main protease produced by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and its application to the evaluation of M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitory compounds. The protocol assays the M<sup>pro</sup> protease activity using a specific fluorogenic probe Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AMC which has been described by <a href="#bib10">Rut et al. (2020)</a> as the preferred synthetic substrate for M<sup>pro</sup> (K<sub>M</sub> = 207 μM for analog substrate Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC). The fluorogenic substrate molecule contains the two non-natural amino acids L-2-aminobutyric acid (Abu) and L-tert-leucine (Tle) and the two natural amino acids L-leucine (Leu) and L-glutamine (Gln). The oligopeptide carries the fluorophore 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) at the C-terminal end of glutamine, i.e., linked <i>via</i> a peptide bond (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Upon cleavage by M<sup>pro</sup>, a fluorogenic moiety is released and a fluorescent signal is produced. The assay can be used for, e.g., the analysis of M<sup>Pro</sup> activity in infected cell cultures and assessment of potential M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors.</p>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> For best results, use freshly prepared buffer in your experiments. DTT has a half-life of less than one hour under certain conditions in aqueous solution, i.e. 40°C and pH 8.5, and should always be added freshly to solutions. DTT stock solution can be stored in aliquots for up to one year at −80°C, but multiple freezing and thawing cycles should be avoided. The addition of EDTA to the DTT stock solution at a 0.1 mM concentration improves its stability (<a href="#bib11">Stevens et al. 1983</a>).</div>

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> DTT is often used in inhibition assays with proteases, but may interfere with the efficacy of certain inhibitors, e.g. ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, carmofur, shikonin, and PX-12 (<a href="#bib8">Ma et al. 2020</a>).example, ebselen. In the initial screenings of potential inhibitors and in control assays with ebselen, it is recommended to omit DTT from the assay buffer or test different reducing agents (<a href="#bib7">Lee et al. 2012</a>). DTT-free assay buffer can be stored at +4°C for several months. Similarly, EDTA prevents the possible interference of metal ions with the protease and thus compromises its activity (<a href="#bib6">Kozak et al. 2020</a>).</div>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min</div>
<p>By supplementing the assay buffer with an inhibitory molecule, the assay measurement can be used to assess the impact of the compound tested on the M<sup>pro</sup> protease activity. A high concentration of ebselen can be used as a positive control for activity inhibition. Here, suggested concentrations are presented. M<sup>pro</sup> inhibition can be presented as a relative value to the signal obtained without ebselen that will be considered as 0% inhibition (100% activity) reference value. The IC<sub>50</sub> value is the inhibitor concentration where the enzyme activity is inhibited by 50%. An IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.67 μM for ebselen has been experimentally determined towards SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> (<a href="#bib5">Jin et al. 2020</a>). The inhibitory activity of ebselen is tested in a 0.02–20 μM concentration range, with solutions dispensed in triplicate wells. For each novel inhibitor the optimal concentration range, covering the IC<sub>50</sub>, needs to be determined individually. In order to account for assay variability, we recommend to prepare and measure three replicate dilution series for each inhibitor.</p>
<p>The serial dilution of the inhibitors should be prepared right before measurement, possibly while the instrument is equilibrating to the desired temperature of 37°C.</p>
<p>The stock solution of inhibitor, i.e., ebselen, prepared in advance, can be diluted in a time-efficient way directly in the multiwell plate as follows:</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>In three 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, combine 0.998 mL of assay buffer without DTT (in the case of ebselen) and 2 μL of 200<b>×</b> inhibitor stock solution (20 mM ebselen). This 2<b>×</b> ebselen working solution has a concentration of 40 μM.
<ol type="a">
<li>Mix well by vortexing.</li>

<h3 id="sec3.1">Assembly of the assay mixture for M<sup>pro</sup> activity measurement</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10 min</div>
<p>Depending on the extent of your experiment and the number of samples to measure, plan the number of wells of the multiwell plate you will need and the volume of reagents required, i.e., considering a single reaction volume of 200 μL but also a possible 10% disposable volume. To measure M<sup>pro</sup> activity in three replicate measurements, we have routinely used a working solution containing the substrate at a concentration of 100 μM. This working solution is prepared as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the 1.025<b>×</b> substrate working solution by adding 20.5 μL of substrate stock solution to 979.5 μL of assay buffer with DTT.</li>
<li>After adding the assay buffer and the substrate but before the addition of the enzyme, pre-warm the plate for 5 min at the desired assay temperature in the plate reader, e.g., 22°C or 37°C.</li>
<li>Before measurement, let all solutions equilibrate to room temperature (20°C–22°C).</li>
<li>Dispense 195 μL of the 1.025<b>×</b> working solution in each of 5 wells of a black multiwell plate.</li>
</ol>
<p>After adding the assay buffer and the substrate but before the addition of the enzyme, pre-warm the plate for 5 min at the desired assay temperature in the plate reader, e.g., 22°C or 37°C.</p>
<h3 id="sec3.2">Measurement of the enzymatic activity of the M<sup>pro</sup> protease</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 10–60 min</div>
<p>Enzymatic activity is defined as enzyme units and one enzyme unit corresponds to the amount of enzyme that will release one micromole of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) in one minute in assays with 0.1 mM Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AMC at 37°C and pH 7.3. In this case, the enzymatic activity can be expressed as increase of fluorescence (arbitrary units, RFU) over time. Most microplate readers allow the analysis of the curves produced by the measurements and a slope value expressed in variation of fluorescent signal per minute can be obtained. These values can be used to compare results obtained within the same measurement or by the same instrument, i.e., in RFU/min.</p>
<p>For routine activity assays and inhibition studies, the comparison of fluorescence values as RFU is sufficient. In this respect, a positive control reaction is set up and can be used as a reference of 100% relative to the other reactions.</p>
<p>In the procedure, the enzyme mixture is added last to initiate the reaction, the measurement should start immediately (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>) with settings enabling fluorescence measurement from the top with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm every 30 s for at least 10 min.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Proceed to measure the fluorescence immediately.
<ol type="a">
<li>Place the microplate in the plate reader and measure the fluorescence from the top with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm every 30 s over a 10–60 min period until sufficient data points for a reliable data fitting are gathered.</li>
<li>Shaking during measurement is an option some equipment offer and is beneficial to ensure a more homogenous distribution of both substrate and enzyme.</li>

<p>In order to save reagent while maintaining a substrate concentration below the reported K<sub>M</sub>, the inhibitor screening assays are performed at 25 μM fluorogenic substrate concentration and 5 μg/mL M<sup>pro</sup> concentration by diluting the stock solution 200<b>×</b>, i.e., 100 μL of respective stock solutions to 1.9 mL of buffer. The assay is performed in a black multiwell plate and in a preheated plate reader at 37°C to simulate human body conditions. When scouting for novel inhibitors, the step here presented with ebselen should be adapted to include a wider inhibitor concentration range between 1 nM and 1 mM and through log<sub>10</sub> dilution steps.</p>

<li>By plotting the fluorescence values (RFU) over time and fitting the curve to a straight line, extract the rate of RFU increase over time (RFU/min) for each well using the trend line fitting in Microsoft Excel (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).
<ol type="a">

<p>Successfully carried out, this protocol allows the detection and measurement of the proteolytic activity of the previously referred to as main protease M<sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2 as a fluorescent signal (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). By supplementing potential inhibitors to the activity assay, their inhibitory activity on M<sup>pro</sup> protease can be assessed. The number of natural molecules acting as inhibitors is growing (<a href="#bib1">Bharadwaj et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#bib3">Ghahremanpouret al. 2020</a>, <a href="#bib9">Qiao et al. 2021</a>) and the assay can serve as a tool for the high throughput screening of new inhibitors to the clinically relevant protease M<sup>pro</sup> (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>) and the determination of their characteristic IC<sub>50</sub> values (<a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a>, <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). Moreover, it presents how it is possible to convert device-specific fluorescence values into values reflecting the substrate concentration (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, <a href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol relies on the high specificity of the fluorogenic substrate used for M<sup>pro</sup>. It has however been tested only with the purified form of the M<sup>pro</sup> protease and thus results obtained from complex M<sup>pro</sup>-containing samples might differ. In studies analyzing activity of M<sup>pro</sup> in infected cells, an antibody-based assay specific for M<sup>pro</sup> might be used to further support the evidence obtained with the fluorescence-based assay presented here.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>No fluorescent signal is detected upon addition of the enzyme to the substrate solution during the measurement of the enzymatic activity (step 6).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure to be using a fresh M<sup>pro</sup> solution, dispense a higher concentration of M<sup>pro</sup> in the assay mixture, increase the detection sensitivity of the reader, or monitor the reaction for longer time. Additionally, you might want to test different concentrations of protease and of substrates at first to assess the sensitivity of the detection of your instrument, e.g., being able to detect the signal of a solution containing an AMC concentration as expected to be produced by the reaction without saturating the detector. For example, to obtain concentration of M<sup>Pro</sup> main protease lower than 1 mg/mL, pre-dilute M<sup>Pro</sup> solution in assay buffer, e.g., 0.1 mL of sock solution added of 0.9 mL of assay buffer for a 10-fold dilution.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The substrate, inhibitor, or enzyme are not soluble during the preparation of the stock solutions (steps 1–15 in “<a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Control the pH of the buffer for protease dilution and check if a suitable organic solvent such as DMSO has been used for the substrate</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>No linearity is found in the development of fluorescence during the measurement of the enzymatic activity (step 10).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Repeat the measurement by adjusting the reading settings of the instrument or by using higher or lower concentration of M<sup>pro</sup> protease, e.g., 10-fold higher or lower, or measure for a longer time, e.g., 1 h.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The inhibitor is not soluble in DMSO and precipitates giving a cloudy solution during the preparation of the stock solutions (step 14 in “<a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Depending on the chemical properties of investigated inhibitors use other solvents, e.g., water, ethanol, methanol, or dimethyl formamide, and mild heating may be better suited.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>No S-shaped curve is visible after plotting the activity data obtained in the presence of an inhibitor during the inhibition study (step 20).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Ensure that the dilution series encompasses the IC<sub>50</sub> value, if known, for the inhibitor used as reference, e.g., ebselen to be used as positive control. As previously mentioned referring to unknown inhibitors, the IC<sub>50</sub> might lay outside the presented range. In this case, an initial step to test inhibition and encompassing a concentration between 1 nM and 1 mM of the inhibitor through log<sub>10</sub> dilution steps should be performed.</p>
