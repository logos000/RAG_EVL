<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a feasible and sustainable approach to address water scarcity issues. Featuring the high affinity of hygroscopic salts with water vapor, salt-based composite sorbents have been widely used. However, the risk of salt solution leakage is still challenging. In this protocol, we introduce a porous waterproof and moisture-permeable membrane encapsulation technique to develop salt-based sorbents. The high salt content composites (HSCC-Ex) exhibit remarkably high salt content of 80 wt % without the risk of leakage.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2021.100664">Shan et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>The protocol below describes the specific steps and typical characterizations of a salt-based composite sorbent HSCC-Ex with the ultra-high salt content of 80 wt%. The developed sorbent HSCC-E10 shows high vapor sorption capacity of 3.75 g/g, 2.83 g/g, and 1.47 g/g for 90%, 70%, and 30% RH, respectively. The sorbents are suitable for any ambient conditions to realize water harvesting in anytime and anywhere. Furthermore, scale-up and practical application potential of developed sorbents are also reported.</p>
<p>The protocol takes the active carbon fiber felt (ACFF) matrix, 30 wt% lithium chloride solution, and porous PTFE membrane as examples. But more importantly, a porous waterproof and moisture permeable membrane encapsulation method is developed and can be applied to any salt-based sorbents to prevent the risk of solution leakage. For example, other matrixes for salt-based sorbents, such as PAM-CNT (<a href="#bib1">Li et al., 2018</a>) and rGO-SA (<a href="#bib4">Xu et al., 2021</a>), other hygroscopic salts, such as LiCl and CaCl<sub>2</sub>, even different waterproof and moisture permeable membranes, such as PVDF membrane or omniphobic fabric (<a href="#bib2">Li et al., 2021</a>), can be used for synthesizing membrane encapsulated salt-based sorbents according to this protocols. Here lithium chloride (LiCl), as a kind of salt with the highest AWH capacity, was selected as an example, which produces the maximum amount of salt solution and the largest volume expansion during the sorption process. Other salts will produce less volume expansion than lithium chloride. The applicability of the encapsulation method could pave the road for future middle- or large- scale SAWH applications.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.1">Lithium chloride solution preparation</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 40 min</div>
<p>The preparation of the sorbents requires a large amount of lithium chloride solution with different concentration (from 10 wt% to 30 wt%). The total quantity varies according to the size and weight of the prepared sorbents. The following procedures takes the preparation of 800 g 30 wt% lithium chloride solution as an example.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol allows for the synthesis of HSCC-E10 with ultra-high salt content of 80 wt%. More importantly, this protocol shows a membrane encapsulation method, which is suitable for salt-based composite sorbents to prevent the risk of solution leakage. The expected results will be consistent with our previous paper on Cell Reports Physical Science (<a href="#bib3">Shan et al., 2021</a>), and some criteria lists below.</p>
<h3 id="sec3.1">Expected visual outcomes</h3>
<p>The selected ACFF matrix consists of many entangled fibers (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>A), and the PTFE membranes are therefore composed of a large number of nodes and fibers (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B). The gap sizes of the selected membranes were determined by the density of nodes. After impregnation, nanoscale crystallization of LiCl particles occupy the micropores on the surface of each fiber, although there were small amounts of agglomeration due to the ultra-high salt content (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>C and 5D).</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="sec3.2">Expected masses of original matrices and prepared sorbents</h3>
<p>The impregnation process is to fully fill the matrix with lithium chloride solution, so that after drying, the water in lithium chloride solution will be lost, only leaving lithium chloride salts as the hygroscopicity component. The most critical parameter in the whole process is how much hygroscopic salt is left after drying, as the salt content is critical to the water harvesting performance. Therefore, we do not record how much salt solution enters the matrix, instead of caring about how much hygroscopic salt ends up in the composite sorbents. <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> shows the weights of original ACFF and ACFF loaded salts after drying. The weight of membrane is not accounted here, so the salt content is higher than ~80% (ave. 84.37%). The areas of these matrices are 25 x 25 cm<sup>2</sup>, and the concentration of lithium chloride solution is 30 wt%. As expected, the sorbents show nearly the same salt content in 10 repeated experiments, because each matrix has a similar capillary force to contain a basically same weight of salt solution before drying. Thus, the final difference in salt content (max. 2.16 wt %) is very small.</p>

<h3 id="sec3.3">Expected nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of ACFF and HSCC</h3>
<p>Because of the fibers and the interstices formed by their windings, ACFF matrix shows large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area (1901.95 m<sup>2</sup>/g). The texture grooves on the surface of each fiber provides pores and channels for enhancing the mass transfer of salt solution and the attachment of LiCl salt particles. As shown in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>, the porous structure can be confirmed by the high nitrogen adsorption amount on the ACFF, and the type I adsorption-desorption isotherm indicated the domination of micropores. After the salt loading, these nanoscale LiCl crystals adhere on the surface of each fiber and occupied the micropores, thus, the absorbed quantity decreases much.</p>

<p>Due to the ultra-high salt content, HSCC-E10 shows excellent water uptake performance. The hygroscopic salt shows strong environment adaptability because of its high affinity with water vapor. To evaluate the sorption performance in different regions with various climates, three humidity conditions are selected as the simulated working conditions: 30% RH to represent the relative humidity at nighttime in arid areas, 70% RH for the typical environmental conditions in semi-humid region, and 90% RH to conform to humid regions. It shows that HSCC-E10 could harvest 3.75 g/g, 2.83 g/g and 1.47 g/g water at the RHs of 90%, 70% and 30%, respectively (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>).</p>

Conversely, the membrane-free composite HSCC reached its maximum sorption capacity in the first cycle. After the first cycle, the water uptake of HSCC was ∼30% lower than that of HSCC-E10 due to its low salt content after the occurrence of salt solution leakage.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The used PTFE membranes look white and even semitransparent (depended on pore sizes), which are the poor solar absorbers. Therefore, a selective solar absorber plate with high solar-thermal efficiency can be combined with these encapsulated sorbents to convert solar energy and heat the sorbents for further water release. We also noticed that the PTFE membranes can be covered with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes to obtain the capacity of absorbing solar energy. However, these could lead to a reduced hydrophobicity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to obtain a better moisture permeability, these membranes are all without support layers, therefore, the membranes with the pore sizes of 5 μm or larger should be used carefully to prevent being tore.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The 12 h water uptake of the sorbent is more than 10% worse than that reported above (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>; step 3 in Lithium chloride solution preparation and step 5 in Immersing in the lithium chloride solution to load hygroscopic salt ).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The ideal salt content of HSCC-E10 sorbents is 80 ± 2 wt%, and the salt content much effect the final sorption performance, so it is important to weight the different before and after impregnation and evaluate whether impregnation process is successful. If not, please check the following two points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carefully check the concentration of lithium chloride solution when impregnating salt solution. If anhydrous lithium chloride is exposed in the air for too long, this hygroscopic salt can absorb a large amount of water vapor and form lithium chloride hydrate. This can lead to the weight deviation, resulting in the reduction of the actual content of lithium chloride.</li>
<li>Check the impregnation process carefully. Insufficient solution height (less than 3 cm), vacuum, placing time inside the dry oven, or overlapping of ACFF matrix during impregnation can result in less solutions into the matrix, resulting in a reduced salt content.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>SEM images show that most fibers are covered by salt particles (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>; step 5 in Immersing in the lithium chloride solution to load hygroscopic salt).</p>
<p>Please note that a small number of fibers may be covered with salt particles due to the ultra-high salt content, especially on the surface of sorbents, but the poor sorption performance will obtain if most fibers are buried in salt particles.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Note that hanging to dry is essential and the slower drying speed (1–2 h from ambient temperature to 120°C) can help the salt solution to crystallize at the nanoscale on the surface channels of each fiber.</p>
<p>In addition, we notice that there are several types of commercial ACFF matrixes, including hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and with different specific surface areas. In this protocol, the hydrophilic ACFF matrix with high specific surface area of ∼1,800 m<sup>2</sup>/g is used.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>The lithium chloride solution remains turbid after being stirred for a long time (steps 1–3 in Lithium chloride solution preparation).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is mostly caused by too many impurities in the selected lithium chloride reagent. Please change the types or providers.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The sorption kinetics of obtained HSCC without membrane is consistent with our reported results, however, that of HSCC-E10 is obviously slower than above results (steps 7 and 11 in Encapsulating with porous membrane and drying of HSCC-E10).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We notice that there are a variety of related commercial PTFE membranes, such as the PTFE-layer membranes with PE support layer that are with better strength, but it is necessary to choose a PTFE membrane only with the porous PTFE layer to minimize the impact on sorption kinetics.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The salt solution after sorption process is still leaked even though the membrane has encapsulated the salt-based composite sorbent (steps 7 and 11 in Encapsulating with porous membrane and drying of HSCC-E10).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Please carefully check that the membrane is completely sealed with sorbents and the membrane is not cracked.</p>
