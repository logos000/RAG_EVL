<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>N-glycans and lipids are structural metabolites that play important roles in cellular processes. Both show unique regional distribution in tissues; therefore, spatial analyses of these metabolites are crucial to our understanding of cellular physiology. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is an innovative technique that enables <i>in situ</i> detection of analytes with spatial distribution. This workflow details a MALDI-MSI protocol for the spatial profiling of N-glycans and lipids from tissues following application of enzyme and MALDI matrix.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib4">Drake et al. (2018)</a> and <a href="#bib1">Andres et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<p>The workflow described in this protocol takes several days and requires careful preparation of reagents and access to specific equipment (see <a href="#materials-and-equipment">Materials and equipment</a>). This protocol can be adapted to both formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) (N-glycans) and fresh frozen tissues (lipid species) for MALDI-MSI analyses. Here, we describe the step-by-step process using mouse brain tissues; however, it can be applied to a large range of tissues.</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is highly recommended to clean the HTX M5 sprayer after each CHCA matrix application. With the nitrogen gas still on, change the sprayer set point temperature and tray temperature to 30°C, and adjust the Knauer pump flow rate to 300 μL/min using the controlling computer. While the sprayer cools down, switch the sprayer to “load,” flush the line with 5 mL of 50% acetonitrile twice. Repeat line flush with 50% methanol twice. Switch sprayer to “spray” and allow 50% methanol to run through the line until the set point temperature and tray temperature reach 30°C, then switch the sprayer back to the “load” position. Adjust the Knauer pump flow rate back to 100 μL/min, return the drip catcher to below the sprayer nozzle, and turn off the nitrogen gas. Any residual CHCA matrix on the slide stage can be removed with 50% methanol.</div>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Proper laser firing is essential for sufficient ionization of the CHCA matrix, as well as N-glycans and lipids. As laser energy can decrease with time, it is recommended to confirm the laser is performing properly. We recommend testing laser firing on a slide coated with CHCA matrix only and confirming the signal intensity of CHCA matrix peaks. For these analyses, the laser used in this manuscript was approximately 6 months old.</div>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>In our experimental protocol, we describe a detailed method for visualization of N-glycans and lipids from FFPE and fresh frozen tissue, respectively, by MALDI-MSI. Typically, for most mammalian tissues, the Waters Synapt G2 mass spectrometer detects over 120 N-glycan and 200 lipid peaks, depending on the complexity and quality of the tissue. Here, we illustrate an example of the protocol to visualize N-glycans (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>) and lipids (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) from a wild-type mouse brain using the HDI imaging software. Glycan and lipids were assigned based on previously established reports (<a href="#bib2">Colsch and Woods, 2010</a>; <a href="#bib5">Powers et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bib6">Zhang et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib3">Drake et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib4">Drake et al., 2018</a>). In both cases, ion mobility improved N-glycan/lipid detection by separating their peaks from ionization matrix based on differential collision cross section (see <a href="#sec7.3">Troubleshooting 2</a>).</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Imaging</h3>
<p>For the qualitative comparison of N-glycan and lipid species between two or more groups, N-glycan and lipid masses should be normalized to total ion chromatograph (TIC) within each pixel. This will correct for small batch variations introduced by CHCA concentration and laser power reduction over time.</p>
<h3 id="sec5.2">Regional analysis</h3>
<p>For the qualitative analysis of regional abundance of N-glycans and lipids, first N-glycan and lipid masses should be normalized to TIC within each pixel. Then regions of interest (ROI) should be defined by the user. The number of pixels must be consistent between ROIs of two or more groups before exportation of mass spectrometry data. The appropriate statistical analysis for comparison between two more groups should be determined by the user. These include but are not limited to: student's T-test, ANOVA, clustering heat analysis, and principal component analysis.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol requires high quality tissue samples to be properly prepared prior to MALDI-MSI analysis. Tissues not fixed or frozen in a timely manner risk degradation, and tissue sections that are cut higher than the recommended thickness can result in poor quality images. It is also recommended to use recently sectioned tissue, as tissue that has been cut less than 30 days prior yields better sample ionization and signal.</p>
<p>Use of this protocol for N-glycan profiling requires consistency in PNGase F enzymatic activity across sample preparations to ensure reproducible results. Maintaining proper oven temperature and humidity during PNGase F digestion, and the use of a positive control are key to confirming enzymatic activity. It is recommended to use PNGase F from the same vendor and lot number to ensure consistent N-glycan cleavage (see also <a href="#sec7.5">Troubleshooting 3</a>). PNGase F should be stored in single use aliquots in a −80°C freezer. Further, certain commercially available PNGase F frequently contains additives such as glycerol and high salt concentrations that will interfere with the ionization and detection of N-glycans. Such additives will require removal by dialysis.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Uneven PNGase F or CHCA matrix application.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Bubbles in the enzyme or matrix solution can interfere with even sprayer application and maintaining pressure in both the syringe and Knauer pumps. When loading solution into the syringe, make sure to pull the plunger up slowly to reduce the number of bubbles. Once the solution is in the syringe, gently tap it against a hard surface to push bubbles to the top and expel the air. Further, residual CHCA matrix in the sprayer nozzle can crystallize and lead to the sprayer nozzle sputtering. Allowing degassed 50% methanol to flow through the sprayer at 100 μL/min following cleaning, even when the sprayer is not in use, prevents crystallization of any residual matrix in the sprayer line. If the pressure in the Knauer pump fluctuates, this will cause the matrix spray to be uneven as well. This could be caused by an air bubble in the front of the pump, so prime the pump again and pull about 10 mL of methanol through the pump to get rid of the bubble.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Low signal across tissue.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>For N-glycans, PNGase F activity can be checked by use of a positive control. Following antigen retrieval, addition of a small amount of a protein such as horseradish peroxidase (known to be glycosylated) onto the slide away from the tissue can be used to assess PNGase F activity. If N-glycan signal is within range on the control protein, but not on the tissue sample, the dewaxing, or antigen retrieval steps may need to be investigated, as insufficient dewaxing or antigen retrieval can block enzymatic access to the N-glycans. If no signal was detected on the positive control, check PNGase F solution for integrity or sprayer may be blocked.</p>
<p>For lipids, make sure tissue is 4–10 μm thickness. Tissue thicker than 10 μm decreases laser ionization efficiency; 4 μm provides better ionization for gangliosides. Make sure CHCA is prepared fresh daily and properly stored. Repeat freeze thawing cycle of CHCA will compromise ionization efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Inconsistent N-glycan cleavage across the sample or poor detection of regional N-glycans.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This protocol requires that the tissue analyzed is sectioned evenly and of a specific thickness. Uneven tissue samples produce inconsistent and variable results. Further, problems during PNGase F incubation period can cause inconsistent enzymatic cleavage. Slides must remain flat in the humidity chamber during incubation, as well as proper temperature and humidity must be maintained. Ensure that the paper towel in the chamber remains wet during incubation.</p>
