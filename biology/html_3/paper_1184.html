<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Teeth and the surrounding periodontal tissues are affected by many pathologies that compromise their integrity and significantly affect life quality. The study of the main dental tissues, the dental pulp and periodontium, is made arduous by their close association with highly mineralized tissues (dentin, cementum, and alveolar bone). Here we describe a protocol to isolate all cells composing human dental pulp and periodontium for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00659-6/sref7">Pagella et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>This protocol describes the isolation of dental pulp and periodontal cells from healthy, freshly extracted human teeth. All Materials required are listed in the attached <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a>.</p>
<p>The protocol was successfully applied to different types of human teeth, mainly to third molars (wisdom teeth). We selected preferentially teeth extracted from patients between 18 and 35 years of age, as dental pulp size significantly decreases with age, due to the continuous (lifespan) deposition of secondary dentin by odontoblasts (<a href="#bib3">Goldberg et al., 2011</a>). Beware of the legal requirements for the access to human specimens applicable at your institution. Our study (<a href="#bib7">Pagella et al., 2021</a>) was performed on completely anonymized teeth; the procedure for the collection of anonymized human dental pulp and periodontal cells at the Center of Dental Medicine (ZZM) of the University of Zurich was approved by the Ethic Commission of the Kanton of Zurich (reference number 2012-0588) and the patients gave their written informed consent.</p>
<p>Pivotal for the success of the single-cell RNA sequencing procedure is to minimize the operation time between the tooth extraction and the dental pulp and periodontal tissues isolation procedure. Therefore, all solutions and instruments listed below, and in the annexed <a href="#key-resources-table">key resources table</a>, should be prepared and ready to use before tooth extraction by the dentists.</p>
<p>Immediately after extraction, the teeth should be stored in sterile either NaCl 0.9% / Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) or Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Thereafter, the teeth should be transferred on ice from the clinic (operation room) to the research laboratory. 20 min or less is considered the ideal timing between the tooth extraction procedure and the beginning of the isolation of the dental pulp and periodontal tissues.</p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>A healthy dental pulp (age 18–35) from a third molar will provide approx. 1–2 million cells; a periodontium will provide 50,000 cells. With this protocol, we successfully isolated and described mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, Schwann/glial cells, immune cells, odontoblasts, and epithelial cells, and managed to detect important cellular heterogeneity within each of these cellular subtypes. Classical dental pulp cells and periodontal cells isolation protocols often rely on enzymatic digestion via combinations of Trypsin, Dispase and Collagenase (<a href="#bib8">Rodas-Junco and Villicaña, 2017</a>; <a href="#bib11">Yasui et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib2">Athanassiou-Papaefthymiou et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib5">Hilkens et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib6">Morsczeck et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#bib4">Gronthos et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib1">About et al., 2000</a>). We opted for a digestion solution containing only Collagenase to minimize the potential impact of the dissociation protocol on possibly fragile cell types inhabiting the dental pulp and the periodontium.</p>
<p>Teeth from different patients displayed high variability, in particular concerning immune cells.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The protocol provides a rapid and robust dissociation pipeline for human dental tissues. Some cell types, such as neutrophils, were underrepresented in our specimens, possibly due to their low resistance to our dissociation procedure (<a href="#bib9">Teng et al., 2017</a>). Similarly, only a small proportion of odontoblasts are detached from the dentin, where their odontoblastic processes reside. Often pulp detachment from the dentin leads to ruptures of the odontoblastic processes from their bodies, thus killing odontoblasts.</p>
<p>In some cases, high levels of cell death were also detected in the periodontium (up to 40%), due to the combination of harsh tooth extraction from the alveolar bone and the mechanical detachment (scratching) of periodontal cells from the tooth roots.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Potential contamination of gingival cells in the periodontium (step 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>As indicated in the protocol, wash the tooth thoroughly in sterile HBSS before scratching the periodontium. If large pieces of gingiva are attached to the extracted tooth, remove them before proceeding with the scratching of the periodontium. Always scratch only the lower two thirds of the roots to isolate the periodontium.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>High cell mortality in the periodontium; scraping the periodontium with the cutting edge of the scalpel, although efficient, might lead to high cell mortality (step 4).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Scrape the periodontium using the non-cutting edge of the scalpel.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Persistence of mineralized tissue in the dissociation reaction; fragments of dentin persist during the digestion and remain associated with clumps of tissue (step 18).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Exerting too much force during the “tooth cracking” step might create small dentin fragments, which remain embedded in the dental pulp and impair proper dissociation and disturb pipetting and filtering. To avoid this issue, crack the tooth with a single, decisive stroke – being it via the press (best method) or a hammer.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Incomplete dissociation: after the described digestion time, clumps of tissues are still visible and do not dissolve upon pipetting (step 27)</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Chopping the tissues into the smallest possible fragments before digestion is fundamental to ensure proper collagenase P access to the tissues; having too large pieces often results in incomplete digestion. In case of incomplete digestion, add Trypsin to the dissociation mixture at a final concentration of 0.25% (from a 10X stock, such as Trypsin 2.5%, Gibco, 15090046). Carefully monitor the dissociation reaction every 10 min and pipette up and down with a p1000 pipette to help tissue disaggregation. Stop the reaction by diluting the cell suspension in HBSS + 2% FBS, as indicated above, as soon as the dissociation is completed. Excessive trypsin incubation (more than 45 min) can result in the loss of delicate cell types and loss of surface antigens (<a href="#bib10">Tsuji et al., 2017</a>).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>High variability between samples: relative abundance of cell types highly variable between samples (step 27).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>A certain extent of variability between samples is normal and represents biological variability between patients. Moreover, if patients are completely anonymized as in our studies, the experimenter can assess solely the health status of the tooth, and not the overall health condition of the donor, which could affect in particular immune cells present in dental tissues.</p>
<p>Experimental variability can be affected by collagenase P batches; we indeed observed important variability in the dissociation efficiency between different collagenase P batches. We suggest performing the dissociation of samples all with the same batch of collagenase P.</p>
