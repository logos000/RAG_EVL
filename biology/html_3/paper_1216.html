<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Here, we detail a surface biotinylation technique used to label surface-expressed proteins in primary neuronal cultures. Surface proteins are labeled with membrane-impermeant Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, and isolated by pull-down with streptavidin beads followed by western blotting to measure levels of surface expression of the protein of interest under different conditions. We have used this approach extensively to monitor activity-dependent changes in α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and kainate receptor (KAR) subunits. However, this protocol can be used to investigate any surface-expressed protein.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00698-5/sref3">Nair et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Ethical approval</h3>
<p>All the animal experiments and procedures were performed in compliance with the UK Animal Scientific Procedures act (1986) and were guided by the Home Office Licensing Team at the University of Bristol. All animal procedures relating to this study were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Board at the University of Bristol (approval number UIN/18/004).</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 0.5–1 h</div>
<ol>
<li>On the day of experiment, prepare buffers and other reagents as per the requirement. See <a href="#materials-and-equipment">materials and equipment</a> for a list of recipe tables.</li>
<li>Prepare 500 mL fresh Earle’s buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose) and adjust the pH to 7.4 with Tris-Base.</li>
<li>After adjusting the pH transfer 5 mL of Earle’s buffer to a bijou container or a falcon tube and add 5 μL of Tetradotoxin (TTX) (1 mM stock; 1 μM final concentration) and 20 μL of GYKI53655 (10 mM stock; 40 μM final concentration).</li>
<li>Mix the solution thoroughly and transfer 2.5 mL of the solution to a fresh bijou and add 2.5 μL of kainate (10 mM stock; 10 μM final concentration).</li>
<li>Leave both bijous (control and kainate solutions) in a 37°C water bath for at least 20 min to pre-warm the buffers.</li>
<li>Prepare 10 mL of 0.3 mg/mL Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in Earle’s buffer.</li>
<li>Prepare 20 mL of 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl solution in Earle’s buffer.</li>
<li>Prepare the wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS).</li>
<li>Prepare 20× protease inhibitor cocktail; 20× solution is made by dissolving 1 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet in 2 mL of dH<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
<li>Prepare neuronal lysis buffer. Add 20× protease inhibitor cocktail to the wash buffer to a final concentration of 1× (for example, 0.5 mL of 20× protease inhibitor cocktail in a final volume of 10 mL lysis buffer).</li>
<li>All the buffers mentioned in steps 2 and 6–10 should be left on ice for at least 30 min prior to the start of the experiment.</li>
<li>Prepare a flat surface of ice in an ice box to incubate the dishes of neurons on for the duration of the surface biotinylation procedure.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is important that all the steps in the surface biotinylation with Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin are performed on ice unless specifically otherwise stated. In addition to protease inhibitors, we recommend using a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail if the phosphorylation status of the protein(s) under investigation are of interest.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin can be used as an alternative to cleavable Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. In this protocol, the SS linkage is not cleaved.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The kainate stimulation described below is performed in the presence of TTX, to prevent confounding issues resulting from action potential firing, and GYKI53655 to prevent direct activation of AMPARs by kainate.</div>

<li>Leave the plates in a 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator.</li>
<li>Day 2 – Wash the plates 3 times with 2 mL dH<sub>2</sub>O.</li>
<li>Add 1.5 mL of plating media (Neurobasal® (Gibco) supplemented with 5% Horse Serum, 2% B27, 1% glutamax, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and leave the plates in a 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator for 12–24 h.</li>
<li>Day 3 (dissection day) – Exchange the plating media for 2 mL of fresh plating media and return the plates to the incubator until the neurons are ready for plating.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Poly-D-lysine can also be used as an alternative to PLL. This should be determined by the experimenter depending upon the availability of resources.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The day of the surface biotinylation experiment must be determined by analyzing the expression profile of the receptor or protein of interest.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> While B27 contains biotin, this is not an issue – the biotin used to label surface proteins is Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin that contains an active group attached that allows it to react with primary amines on surface-expressed proteins. Unmodified biotin in media does not have this active group, so it doesn’t label proteins when present in the media.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The same protocol can be used for dissociating and plating cortical neurons.</div>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> It is recommended that neurons are left on ice for 5–10 min after being removed from the incubator especially while performing acute experiments that may alter the trafficking of surface receptors. Cooling down the neurons to 4°C prevents trafficking of the receptors and avoids cold shocking the neurons by immediate addition of an ice-cold buffer (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Any of the above-mentioned buffers (Earle’s buffer, HBS, DPBS) can be used, but for pharmacological stimulations, either pre-warmed Earle’s buffer or HBS is preferred, and the same buffer (cold) is advised for washing.

<p>Our protocol allows efficient labeling and isolation of surface proteins from neurons with minimal labeling of internal proteins. Using this method, we recently demonstrated that the kainate stimulation protocol outlined here leads to a reduction in the surface expression of AMPARs and KARs in hippocampal neurons (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Neuronal live surface biotinylation is a powerful technique to label, isolate and quantify levels of surface proteins in neurons. However, for synaptic proteins, a major limitation of this technique is the lack of spatial information, so it is not possible to determine whether the labeled proteins are surface expressed at the synapse, or in the extra-synaptic membrane. As a result, this protocol is usually complemented by imaging studies that can specifically examine changes in the levels of the protein of interest at synapses, or by functional studies using patch-clamp recordings to measure the activity (for example, mini-EPSCs or EPSCs for AMPARs or other iGluRs) of the protein of interest at the synapse.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Presence of internal control protein in pull-down lanes (step 34 – <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<p>One of the potential problems that can be experienced is the presence of the internal control protein such as GAPDH in the pull-down lanes after Western blot. Most likely this is due to disruption of neurons during the surface labeling step or due to endogenously biotin bound proteins like acetyl CoA carboxylase ACC1/2 that can come down in streptavidin pull-downs. The experimenter must be mindful of this and select appropriate internal control proteins.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Neurons are particularly sensitive to changes in osmolarity, which can result in cell lysis. Higher-density cell cultures (500,000) tend to resist small changes in osmolarity. However, if using lower density cultures or if there is a persistent presence of the internal control band in the pull-down, we recommend measuring and adjusting, as necessary, the osmolarity of the buffer (Earle’s, HBS or DPBS) using sucrose or dH<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Change in the pH of Earle’s buffer or HBS (step 3 - <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a>).</p>
<p>Long-term storage of Earle’s buffer or HBS at 18°C–25°C can result in changes in the pH of the buffer. This is often due to the growth of microbes.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Store the stocks at 4°C. Make small aliquots of 10× stocks and store at −20°C for up to 6 months.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Neurons are unresponsive to stimulation (step 35 – <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<p>While performing kainate or NMDA stimulations prior to surface biotinylation neurons can become less responsive and/or fail to respond to the stimulations. This is most likely due to compromised neuronal health. Therefore, it is essential that biotinylation experiments are carried out on morphologically intact, healthy, viable neurons.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We recommend the experimenter check the neuronal morphology under a DIC microscope prior to chemical stimulations. Neurons lacking well defined arborization, or exhibiting constricted soma, blebbing or bacterial or fungal contaminations should be discarded.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p><b>Kainate is ineffective</b> (step 6 <b>–</b> <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<p>We have found that kainate in solution degrades even when stored frozen at −20 or −80°C.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We do not recommend storage of aliquoted samples of stock kainate solution for more than 3–4 weeks. Best practice is to make fresh stock solutions from powdered kainate and we recommend parallel positive controls, such as NMDA stimulation.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Diversity of neuronal cell types (step 35 – <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step method details</a>).</p>
<p>We have noted variations in neuronal responses to the kainate stimulation in cortical versus hippocampal neurons which we attribute to the heterogeneity of the cortical cultures compared to the hippocampal neurons.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The experimenter should select the most appropriate neuronal cell culture type based on the receptor or surface protein of interest. We recommend using hippocampal cultures for studies on synaptic plasticity.</p>
