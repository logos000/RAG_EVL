<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Generating high-quality electron microscopy images of the skin and keratinocytes can be challenging. Here we describe a simple protocol for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of murine skin. The protocol enables characterization of the ultrastructure of the epidermis, dermis, hair follicles, basement membrane, and cell-cell junctions. We detail the specific steps for sample preparation and highlight the critical need for proper orientation of the sample for ultrathin sectioning. We also describe the isolation and preparation of primary keratinocyte monolayers for SEM.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2021.02.020">Biswas et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>Obtaining electron microscopy (EM) data involves the use of specialized equipment such as electron microscopes and ultramicrotomes. The use of electron microscopes and ultramicrotomes requires training and practice to obtain routinely good quality sections that will produce good quality images. If the person using this protocol has never done EM before, we recommend that they contact an experienced EM specialist who can guide them and provide the necessary training.</p>
<p>The protocol describes the collection and fixation of skin samples in steps 1–13 in the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section and the post fixation, dehydration, embedding, sectioning and imaging in steps 1–44 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step by step</a> section.</p>
<p>The protocol also describes the procedure for culturing of primary keratinocyte monolayers and fixation for SEM in steps 14–35 in the <a href="#before-you-begin">before you begin</a> section and the post fixation, dehydration and imaging in steps 45–59 in the <a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step by step section</a>.</p>
<h4 id="sec1.1.1">Fixative preparation</h4>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1–2 h</div>
<p>The purpose of this step is to stabilize the biological sample in a way such that the ultrastructure of tissues or cells are preserved. This section describes the fixative preparation for skin samples.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 0.2M Na-Cacodylate buffer and adjust the pH to 7.2.</li>
<li>Prepare 0.2M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution and autoclave the solution.</li>
<li>Prepare the fixative to a final concentration of 2% Glutaraldehyde, 4% Formaldehyde, and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> in 0.05M Na-Cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">

</div>
<h4 id="sec1.1.14">Collection of back skin from mice</h4>
<p>In this protocol, both males and females were used for experiments as no obvious differences were observed between genders. Newborn pups were used for cell monolayer protocol and 3–8 week old animals were used for skin sample protocol. Mice were housed in NCBS/inStem Animal Care Resource Centre. Animals were handled, bred and euthanized in compliance with the guidelines and procedures approved by the inStem IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) (<a href="#bib1">Biswas et al., 2021</a>). Animals were regularly monitored for any health concerns. All animals for experiments were housed in a specific pathogen free (SPF2) facility in ventilated cages kept under 12-h light and dark cycle and were given unlimited food and water. The temperature in the facility was maintained at 21°C.</p>

<li>Apply hair removal cream on the shaved region and leave it for 2 min.</li>
<li>Wipe off the hair removal cream and thoroughly wash the region with water. This will remove any remaining hair found on the shaved region of the skin.</li>
<li>Pat the skin dry.</li>
<li>Draw a line with a thin sharpie marking the midline on the dorsal anterior region of the mouse (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C).</li>
<li>Using forceps, loosen the skin by pinching the desired region of excision.</li>
<li>Cut a rectangular piece of skin alongside the midline of the back using a dissecting scissors and place it dermis side down on a paper towel. (In this study, the anterior region of the mouse back skin was used) (<a href="#fig1">Figures 1</a>B and 1C).</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Keeping the shape rectangular will aid in the orientation of the back skin later.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Work gently and fast. Avoid stretching the back skin too much as this might lead to ruptures within the tissue. The dissected skin should be kept dermis side down on the paper towel for less than a minute.</div>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Marginal fixation will occur if the specimen is not completely submerged or if the basal side is placed upwards in the fixative solution. This happens due to the barrier function of the epidermis; aqueous solutions can only penetrate from the basal side of the skin samples.</div>
<ol start="12">
<li>Fix the sample for 1–2 h at room temperature (RT) (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>E).</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">

<ol start="20">
<li>To isolate primary mouse keratinocytes from P-0 pups, euthanize the mice, remove the back, and belly skin. Place the skin dermis side down in dispase (1 mg/mL in 1<b>×</b>PBS) overnight at 4°C which will aid in the separation of the epidermis from the dermis (<a href="#bib6">Raghavan et al., 2003</a>).</li>
<li>On the same day treat a confluent J23T3 feeder plate (10 cm) with mitomycin C (0.4 mg/mL, using 80μL in 4 mL F media), for 1.5–2 h at 37°C. After treatment, wash the plate with 1<b>×</b>PBS, 4 times and add E media to the plate. Keep in a 32°C incubator overnight.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">

<p>Imaging with an electron microscope will require assistance from someone who is well trained on the SEM or TEM. Electron microscope imaging particulars vary from sample to sample. The steps that are described here are focused only on imaging of skin samples.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>On the day of imaging, place the dried silicon wafer on the SEM pin stub (12.56 mm diameter) using the carbon adhesive tape (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>B and <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C).

<li>The program performs the subsequent steps automatically, which include filling of the liquid into the pre-cooled pressure chamber, purging the CO<sub>2</sub> for 16 cycles at a slow speed, with a delay of 120 s. After the purging cycles, the exchange fluids are replaced with liquid CO<sub>2</sub> and a heating process is initiated at 28°C to generate supercritical CO<sub>2.</sub>
</li>
<li>Subsequently the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> is converted to a gaseous state by maintaining a constant temperature of 31°C. Finally, the pressure in the chamber is reduced by slowly purging the gas in the chamber at a speed of 20% (Gas-Out phase). This entire program runs for 3 h, 8 min and 21 s. After the Gas-out phase, take out the coverslips for sputter coating and imaging.</li>

<p>Following this protocol will help to successfully visualize the ultrastructure of the mammalian skin including the epidermis, dermis and appendages such as the hair follicle (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A) and sebaceous glands. Subcellular structures can also be studied according to the researcher’s interests such as cell junctions, including adherens junctions (AJs), desmosomes (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A’, <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>C, <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>D, and <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>D′), hemidesmosomes and the basement membrane (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>B), mitochondria, cell nuclei, lysosomes, etc. under normal and pathological conditions. Following this protocol will also help to successfully visualize the filopodia extensions at the cell-cell junctions in the primary keratinocyte cell monolayer (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>A and <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>A′).</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>One of the major limitations of SEM is the resolution. The optimal spatial resolution that can be achieved from SEM is around 10 nm, compared to that of TEM, which is around 0.2 nm. For example, finer structures like lamellar granules in the upper layers of the epidermis can be better visualized using TEM (<a href="#bib8">Wertz, 2018</a>). In addition, visualizing finer structures like actin and actin-binding proteins also requires advanced EM techniques like the cryo techniques, light microscopy with super resolution as well as Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) (<a href="#bib3">Jung et al., 2020</a>). Fine structures like individual actin filaments are difficult to visualize from SEM. SEM only provides imaging of the cell surface, unless permeabilization methods are applied. Furthermore, coating with heavy metals may obscure some fine surface details in some specimens. However, SEMs equipped with field emission guns can resolve this issue (<a href="#bib4">Muscariello et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#bib7">Van Meerbeek et al., 2000</a>).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Issue with tissue handling. Excision of tissue can result in mechanical damage to the superficial skin layers, causing the cells to look empty or having ruptured membranes (associated with: “<a href="#before-you-begin">Before you begin</a>” section Steps 10–13).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution 1</h3>
<p>This damage can be caused by delays in placing the sample in fixative due to early postmortem changes, therefore, work quickly. Avoid stretching the back skin too much as this might lead to ruptures within the tissue. Cut the skin with smooth movements of the blade without applying pressure.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Issue with fixative. Problems may arise due to gradient fixation during the fixation procedure, which can later lead to issues while imaging. Similarly, during osmium fixation, issues such as gradient fixation may arise in the adipose tissues, which may lead to the loss of lipid droplets from the sample (associated with: “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step methods</a>” section step 2) (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>A, compared to <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>B).</p>

<p>Scale bar: (A-C): 1 μm, Inset (A′, B′): 1 μm.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution 2</h3>
<p>Keep the sample size small, optimally 1 mm <b>×</b> 2 mm, to avoid problems from gradient fixation.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Issue with dehydration. Prolonged dehydration and deviation from the recommended temperature (associated with: “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step methods</a>” section step 6) may destroy the ultrastructure of the sample whereas shortened dehydration times may cause holes in the section.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution 3</h3>
<p>Perform the dehydration step at 4°C until the 70% ethanol and do not extend or reduce the dehydration time from the recommended duration.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Issues while sectioning. Insufficient mixing of resin components (associated with: “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step methods</a>” section step 7). Insufficient infiltration time of the resin into the sections (associated with: “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step methods</a>” section steps 7–11). Difficulty sectioning due to large sample size after trimming (more than 1 mm in all dimensions) (associated with: “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step methods</a>” section step 18). Dull knife, scratches on the knife (associated with: “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step methods</a>” section steps 23 and 24) (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>C). Sectioning above the recommended thickness can result in holes in the sample and issues with contrast during imaging (associated with: “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step methods</a>” section steps 32–35).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution 4</h3>
<p>Mix for at least 15 min to prepare a homogeneous resin mixture. Do not reduce the resin infiltration time from the recommended duration. Trim away as much excess sample such that the final dimension is no more than 1 mm. Always prepare and use a fresh knife. Always refer to the interference card to monitor the thickness of the sections.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Over drying of samples, insufficient dehydration or CO<sub>2</sub> exchange during CPD could lead to cracks and holes in the sample (associated with: “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">step-by-step methods</a>” section steps: 52–54) (<a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>).</p>
<figure id="fig10"><img src="https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/943-Fig10.jpg" alt="Fig10.jpg">

<div class="figcaption-title">Figure 10. SEM images for troubleshooting for cell monolayer</div>
<p>(A) Electron micrograph showing issues with CPD. Red arrowheads indicating cracks on the cell surface.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution 5</h3>
<p>Processing time should not exceed 3 h for the cell monolayer. If cracking still occurs, reduce the drying duration. Alternatively, other drying methods such as hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) can be used (<a href="#bib2">Braet et al., 1997</a>). After coating, samples should be kept in a dry environment to prevent changes as a result of water absorption or possible cracking of the coated layer.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Masking of details in the sample due to overcoating of the sample using the sputter coater and the charging in SEM due to undercoating of the sample using the sputter coater (associated with: “<a href="#step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-Step methods</a>” section Step 55).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution 6</h3>
<p>A 5–10 nm layer of coating is typically applied for conventional gold/palladium sputtering. If final details are obscured, apply a thinner layer of gold/palladium, or change to a finer grain of element with a lower atomic number. If there is a charging issue while imaging, apply a thicker coat.</p>
