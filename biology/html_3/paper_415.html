<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The 26S proteasome is specialized for regulated protein degradation. It is formed by a regulatory particle (RP) that recognizes ubiquitinated substrates and caps a hollow cylindrical core particle (CP) where substrates are proteolyzed. Structural heterogeneity caused by dynamics makes it challenging to observe ubiquitin chains at the RP by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we present a cryo-EM-based protocol we applied to study the human 26S proteasome with ubiquitin chains by using non-cleavable M1-linked hexaubiquitin (M1-Ub<sub>6</sub>) unanchored to a substrate.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib5">Chen et al. (2020)</a>.</p>

<li>Run the “Motion correction” job. Align movies to compensate for sample movement and drift induced by the beam. Use the MotionCor2 algorithm (<a href="#bib16">Zheng et al., 2017</a>) or RELION’s own implementation to yield drift-corrected micrographs.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> When running the “Motion correction” job for the first time in RELION, it is worth first testing a small set of movies (5–10) to trouble shoot various parameters, such as location of the MOTIONCOR2 executable, how many GPU to use, how much memory per thread to set, the number of MPI (message passing interface) nodes and shared-memory threads to set. Insufficient memory or inappropriate RELION options can kill the job. Check the run.out, run.err files and the output logfile.pdf and corrected_micrographs.star to make sure that the job runs smoothly.</div>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Before running the auto-picking on all micrographs, a few micrographs can be selected to optimize the main parameters of the auto-picking job. Please check the RELION-3.0 tutorial for detailed instructions.</div>

<li>Manually inspect the micrographs with the particles auto-picked in step 39 to add particles missed by the auto-picking. We picked missed particles following the template created in step 37. For the cryo-EM sample of human 26S proteasome with non-cleavable M1-Ub<sub>6</sub> and E6AP included, a total of 1,050,369 particles were picked and extracted by using a box size of 450 pixels.</li>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For 26S proteasome, the particle size is 180 Å by 440 Å making manual inspection helpful and enabling particles missed by auto-picking to be visualized and added. This manual inspection step is a labor-intensive step and took a long time (roughly 80 images per hour). It is an optional step as it may be tough for user to manually inspect over 10,000 micrographs. Also, manual inspection is less useful for smaller protein complexes, which are hard to visualize.</div>
<ol start="41">
<li>Run the “2D classification” job to do reference-free 2D class averaging. The number of classes can be set to 150 and number of iterations to 25.</li>
<li>After the 2D classification job finishes, launch the “Subset selection” job and read the run_it025_model.star file. Select and save all classes with various orientations of appropriately looking proteasome particles and discard the relatively small number of classes that show inappropriate 2D class averages resulting from contamination.</li>
<li>Perform three rounds of 2D classification (Regularization parameter T=2) to identify and discard false positives or other apparent contamination. Following 2D classification, we obtained 593,942 particles to yield 65 suitable 2D classes with various proteasome orientations that were selected, re-centered, and re-extracted.</li>
<li>These particles were subjected to one round of unsupervised 3D classification (T=4) by running the “3D classification” job. We set the number of classes to 6 and number of iterations to 50. The EMAN2 command e2pdb2mrc.py was applied to a reference map from a human proteasome model (PDB: 5VFP) (<a href="#bib17">Zhu et al., 2018</a>).</li>
<li>In our case, the particles were classified into six 3D classes. One class with 134,217 particles showed single capped proteasome (RP-CP) while another with 30,570 particles showed double capped proteasome (2PR-CP). Auto-refinement was performed with a pixel size of 1.365 Å for each of these two classes by running the “Refine3D” job separately.</li>
<li>2RP-CP particles were then converted to pseudo RP-CP particles to perform particle symmetry expansion in RELION by running the command “relion_particle_symmetry_expand.”</li>
<li>The combined RP-CP and pseudo RP-CP particles were subjected to another round of auto-refinement by running a “Refine3D” job.</li>
<li>To investigate the conformational states of the RP, we subtracted CP signal from the particles and conducted masked 3D classifications (T=10) with 8 classes focusing on the RP, as described in previous studies (<a href="#bib2">Bai et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib14">Scheres, 2016</a>). 3 classes of RP-CP particles (contributing 39.3%) fit well to the free human proteasome S<sub>D</sub> state map (EMDB: EMD-8337) (<a href="#bib4">Chen et al., 2016</a>) and showed extra density. These classes were combined for a further auto-refinement job “Refine3D.”</li>
<li>2 classes of RP-CP particles (contributing 18.9%) fit well to the free human proteasome S<sub>A</sub> state map (EMDB: EMD-8666) (<a href="#bib4">Chen et al., 2016</a>) and showed extra density, as did one additional class of pseudo RP-CP particles (contributing 20.5%). These classes were combined for an auto-refinement job “Refine3D.”</li>
<li>After performing 3D auto-refinement, the map is sharpened. First a mask is created by the “Mask creation” job with the output map from the 3D auto-refinement. Then the map is sharpened by running the “Post-processing” job.</li>
<li>By running “CTF refinement” and “Bayesian polishing” jobs in RELION, per-particle CTF refinements and Bayesian polishing are applied and the per-particle defocus and beam tilt estimation added to an output shiny.star file.</li>
<li>Running a new “Refine3D” and a corresponding “Post-processing” job with the shiny particles improve the resolution of the reconstruction. The final maps in our case were sharpened using a B-factor of −76 Å<sup>2</sup> (combined RP-CP and pseudo RP-CP), −104 Å<sup>2</sup> (S<sub>A</sub>-like state), or −133 Å<sup>2</sup> (S<sub>D</sub>-like state).</li>
<li>All resolutions are estimated by applying a soft mask around the protein density and 0.143 Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) value. The combined RP-CP, the S<sub>A</sub> state, or the S<sub>D</sub> state map was refined to 4.1, 4.8 or 5.7 Å resolution respectively and local resolutions for the density maps calculated by running the “Local resolution” job in RELION (<a href="#bib9">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</a>).</li>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>In this cryo-EM-based protocol, we have described how to use commercially available protein samples to study the structure of human 26S proteasome with non-cleavable M1-linked hexaubiquitin (M1-Ub<sub>6</sub>) unanchored to a substrate. By using RELION software to analyze the data, two conformational states of the human 26S proteasome in complex with non-cleavable M1-linked Ub<sub>6</sub> can be observed; specifically, the ground (S<sub>A</sub>) state and substrate-processing (S<sub>D</sub>) state of the proteasome (Figure 1 in (<a href="#bib5">Chen et al., 2020</a>)). In both states, ubiquitin density can be found at human Rpn11 of the proteasome, despite the absence of conjugated substrate (Figure 2 and 3 in (<a href="#bib5">Chen et al., 2020</a>)).</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<p>All cryo-EM data sets were processed by using RELION 3.0.8 (<a href="#bib18">Zivanov et al., 2018</a>), with resolution reported based on FSC criterion of 0.143. FSC curves were calculated using soft spherical masks and high-resolution noise substitution was used to correct for convolution effects of the masks on the FSC curves (<a href="#bib3">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Refined atomic models were evaluated based on MolProbity scores and Ramachandran plots.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This protocol uses commercially available products; therefore, protein or grid quality may vary from batch to batch. SDS-PAGE analysis is required to check the protein quality before making cryo-EM grids. If contamination or damage are consistently observed on the grids, it is recommended to try a different batch or type of Quantifoil grids, or grids from a different company (e.g., C-flat grids from Protochips). The environmental humidity can also affect ice contamination of the grid, as we observed less ice contamination in winter compared to summer. Fine alignment and tuning of the microscope prior to data collection is very important for data quality and will thus influence the final resolution of the cryo-EM map.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>SDS-PAGE shows lower molecular weight bands characteristic of sample degradation.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Always keep protein samples stored at −80°C following receipt and avoid freeze-thaw cycles. Avoid using old buffers, even when stored at 4°C. Add protease inhibitors such as Pefabloc to the buffer to help prevent proteolysis.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>After glow-discharging, the static charge causes the grids to fly off of the holder or to stick to any surface (such as the tweezers) during transfer of the grid.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Use glass petri dishes instead of plastic ones for grid storage; transfer grids without wearing gloves; touch a metal surface to release the static charge before handling grids.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Ice contamination on the grid.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are many ways to reduce ice contamination: always use dry liquid nitrogen; use a dry liquid nitrogen Dewar or container; use humidity control to keep the environment humidity low when freezing grids; wear a mask when handling cryo-grids; avoid talking or breathing toward the cryo-grid when transferring it or when air exposed; keep the copper cup (for liquid ethane), Vitrobot tweezers, transfer station, autoloader cassette, and any other handling tools that may touch the cryo-grids dry.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Crystalline ice formed on the grid.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Avoid warming up the cryo-grid after plunging. Always keep cryo-grids in liquid nitrogen. Reduce the time cryo-grids are exposed to the air when transferring them between containers. Pre-cool handling tweezers sufficiently before use.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Few proteasome particles are observed in the hole of the grid.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>During vitrification, the ice layer is too thin and proteasome is excluded from the hole. If this happens, check the holes with thicker ice to see whether proteasome particles can be observed. It will be necessary to optimize the blotting condition (blot time and blot force) to adjust ice thickness, but it is important to ensure the ice is only slightly thicker than the particle diameter to maximize contrast.</p>
