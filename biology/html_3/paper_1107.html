<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Identification of selective deubiquitinase (DUB) inhibitors is critical for probe development to further understand and explore DUB biological function. Here, we detail the optimization and deployment of an <i>in vitro</i> fluorogenic ubiquitin-rhodamine assay to conduct high-throughput screening of a small molecule library against a panel of DUBs. In screening the compound library against multiple DUBs in parallel, we describe an approach for identifying selective DUB inhibitors and provide a roadmap for enabling selective DUB inhibitor discovery.</p>

<p>The protocol below describes the specific steps of a high-throughput screening campaign to identify small molecule DUB inhibitors using recombinant DUB enzymes and a fluorogenic DUB substrate, Ubiquitin-Rhodamine110 (Ub-Rho). All DUBs should be expressed and purified with concentrations determined. Compound stock solutions source plates should be plated out at appropriate concentrations.</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> ∼5 days</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> This generalizable protocol was used for the expression and purification of deubiquitinases utilized in the high-throughput screen. The protocol details the purification of both 6xHis-tagged and GST-tagged DUBs. Other affinity tags can be utilized for protein purification. Some DUBs are commercially available as purified recombinant proteins or have plasmids that can be purchased for expression and purification. We selected DUBs for screening based on multiple criteria. The first was ease of generating a large enough quantity of enzyme to be able to run the primary and dose response screens. Secondly, we sought to include multiple members of the largest DUB family (the USP subfamily) as well as representatives from the two other most well-studied cysteine proteases DUB families (UCHL and OTU) to assess compound selectivity within and amongst various DUB families. In addition, we selected DUBs associated with interesting biology or were lacking chemical probes to further explore biological function.</div>
<ol>
<li>Constructs encoding each DUB in the panel tested were cloned into either pET28 expression vectors with an N-terminal 6xHis tag or pGEX6P1 expression vector with an N-terminal GST tag in NEB® 10-beta Competent E. coli (High Efficiency) cells.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For one of the DUBs included in the screen, OTUD3, the plasmid was obtained from Addgene and purification was carried out as previously described (<a href="#bib6">Mevissen et al., 2013</a>), which follows the general procedure for GST-tagged purification outlined below.</div>

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For the 6xHis tagged DUBs the tags were not removed. For the GST-tagged DUBs, the elution buffer contained GST 3C protease which removed the GST-tag from the DUB as part of the purification step.</div>

In instances of low or no yield, the SDS-PAGE gel and protein stain analysis can be used to determine at which step in the purification process the desired DUB was eluted off the Ni-NTA or Agarose resin.

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The Ub-Rho cleavage assay involves mixing a solution of purified DUB at varying concentrations in assay buffer and a solution of Ub-Rho at varying concentrations in assay buffer and monitoring fluorescence over time. Active DUB will result in increased fluorescence over time. A generalized protocol for this assay can be found in the <a href="#sec1.3">enzyme and substrate titrations</a> section below.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> While many DUBs have demonstrated activity against Ub-Rho, there are some DUBs that are less active or do not readily cleave Ub-Rho. Some of these DUBs have been shown to cleave alternative substrates that can be deployed in high-throughput screens. See Troubleshooting <a href="#sec7.3">problem 2</a>.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> For these experiments Ub-Rho was purchased from R&amp;D Systems, however, Ub-Rho can be synthesized based on previously established protocols (<a href="#bib3">Hassiepen et al., 2007</a>).</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Purified DUB stocks should be aliquoted to appropriately sized aliquots for desired experiments and flash frozen using liquid N<sub>2</sub> to minimize freeze-thaws.</div>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The DOE approach was deployed to test for optimal buffer. This involves first deciding on relevant buffer components to vary, taking from literature sources or baseline buffer conditions. Once all the factors are chosen, the experimental design is created in JMP statistical software (developed by SAS Institute), which provides the optimal combination of factors to achieve ∼2% coverage of all potential combinations, allowing adequate modeling of each component’s effect on the assay.</div>

<ol type="a">
<li>Variable conditions for each component were selected follows: HEPES and Tris buffers were prepared at three pH values (7, 7.5, and 8) and NaCl was varied at 0, 25, and 50 mM.

<div class="alternatives">
<span class="alternatives-title">Alternatives:</span> A lower throughput method for buffer testing can be deployed by preparing a smaller selection of buffers manually and running the assay in those buffers as described.

Step 1: Compounds are added from source plates to 1536 well assay plates in single concentrations (for primary screen) or in either 4 or 8-point dose-response (for dose-response screens). Columns 45–46 contain DMSO only as a neutral control. Step 2: A 2x solution of DUB in assay buffer is then added to all wells on the plate except columns 47–48 (which receive only assay buffer). Step 3: A 2x solution of Ub-Rho is then added to all wells on the plate. Step 4: Plates are then incubated to allow the DUB enzymatic reaction to occur. Step 5: Fluorescence measurements for each plate are then recorded using a fluorescence plate reader followed by data analysis.</p>

<p>Compute the difference between the two thresholds as the ‘separation band’ of the assay, S. If the threshold computed in step 1 is less than the one computed in step 2, then this difference is positive. Otherwise, this difference will have a negative value.</p>

<p>Normalization of raw data to active and neutral control wells, systematic pattern models, and curve fitting were applied to the data using Helios, a high-throughput screening data analysis program developed at Novartis (<a href="#bib2">Gubler et al., 2018</a>). The median value of DMSO control (neutral control) wells (columns 45–46 on each plate) was calculated for each plate. Individual DMSO wells with raw fluorescence values greater than 4 standard deviations from the median were masked from analysis. Fluorescence data was normalized by the following equation for each fluorescence value:</p>
<p class="math-ml"><math> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mtext>x</mtext> <mo>−</mo> <mtext>NC</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>AC</mtext> <mo>−</mo> <mtext>NC</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math></p>
<p>Where x is the raw fluorescence value for each well, NC is the DMSO neutral control (DMSO + DUB + substrate), and AC is the active control (no DUB). The calculation was multiplied by −1 to represent the active control median being −100% (inhibitory effect). Results were reported as Percent DUB Activity (<a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a>, column 3). For measuring compound potency, a four-parameter sigmoid Hill curve model was fitted to the data (<a href="#bib2">Gubler et al., 2018</a>) and the absolute IC<sub>50</sub> was used for potency measurements, that is the concentration of compound where the data showed 50% inhibition. If no data points achieved 50% inhibition, then the absolute IC<sub>50</sub> was reported as &gt;X μM (where X is the highest tested concentration) <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> shows a representative IC<sub>50</sub> curve based on the data in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>The Ub-Rho screening assay is an <i>in vitro</i> screening assay that doesn’t accurately reflect the cellular conditions that DUBs experience. We have tested some of the hit compounds in cellular experiments to confirm DUB inhibition, however, it is not a given that hits will always confirm when working in cellular contexts (<a href="#bib8">Varca et al., 2021</a>). High-throughput screens, especially using a fluorescence readout, can also be subject to assay interference through a myriad of ways including PAINS compounds, compounds that are autofluorescent, or fluorescence quenchers. While the compound library was curated to avoid these PAINS compounds there is still the possibility that certain compounds demonstrate assay interference phenotypes that can confound results. This assay platform is best utilized to identify potential selective and potent starting points for optimization of DUB inhibitors against a given DUB target which require additional biophysical and cellular validation to confirm them as <i>bona-fide</i> DUB inhibitors.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>No or low protein yield from protein purification.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Examples of issues that may arise and lead to no or low protein yields include not allowing the protein of interest enough time to bind to the resin or using an older batch of resin that may be less efficient at binding the protein tag, both of which can result in much of the protein being discarded after draining the column following the initial incubation step. Alternatively, if the elution solutions are prepared incorrectly, it’s possible that the protein of interest will not elute off of the resin at all. As there are numerous steps during which problems may occur, it is recommended to keep all eluents from each step of the protein purification process to be able to diagnose where potential issues may have arisen in isolating the desired protein. Running an SDS-PAGE gel on a sample of each eluent obtained in the protein purification process can determine which eluents contain the desired protein of interest. Seeing which eluents contain the protein, and which eluents no longer contain the protein, can help determine if there is an issue with a specific step. As a general guideline, it is recommended to use fresh resin, if possible, or if you suspect your resin may be less efficient at binding the protein tag you can increase the amount of resin used. It is also recommended to prepare buffers and solutions fresh on the day of the purification.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Certain DUBs are much less active against or are unable to cleave Ub-Rho.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is always recommended to assess the purity of proteins prior to testing to rule out low activity based on lower purity or degraded protein due to things like multiple freeze-thaw cycles. If protein purity is high but signal is still low, alternative substrates include ubiquitin-like proteins conjugated to rhodamine or short ubiquitin chains functionalized for a fluorescence polarization or fluorescence resonance energy transfer readout(<a href="#bib1">Cho et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib7">Orcutt et al., 2012</a>). In general, most cysteine protease DUBs are amenable to using Ub-Rho as a reporter substrate while zinc metalloprotease DUBs typically require a di-ubiquitin substrate with preference for K63 linked ubiquitin. For example, a K63 linked di-ubiquitin TAMRA probe was used in a fluorescence polarization assay to assess small molecule inhibitors of the zinc metalloprotease DUBs Rpn11(<a href="#bib5">Li et al., 2017</a>). If cost is not an issue, higher concentrations of Ub-Rho can be used to make up for lower signal or alternative substrates can be used. Use of these alternative substrates would require re-optimization of the assay conditions and potentially the use of alternate readouts than the fluorescence readout described in this protocol.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Low activity observed in assay plates can result from a number of reasons, most likely issues in addition of DUB or substrate.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check liquid handling equipment to ensure the proper addition of the correct volumes of enzyme and substrate to assay plates. Insufficient or inaccurate addition of either DUB or Ub-Rho can result in low signal observed as the fluorogenic rhodamine species is not generated. A test run to check out liquid handling steps is recommended followed by a visual inspection of the plate to ensure wells all look like they have received the proper amount of solution and equal amounts. In addition, the volume added to wells can be checked by aspirating the contents of individual wells with a pipette and confirming the volume added that way.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>Preparation of the DUB and Ub-Rho solutions are an important step of the screening protocol. Insufficient mixing or poor-quality reducing agent stock can result in low DUB activity and lead to low assay signal.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>It is crucial that fresh reducing agent is used and is accurately added to all assay buffers. The catalytic cysteine residues of many DUBs are prone to oxidation and require a reducing environment to observe DUB function. Comparison of the assay signal of compound wells to the no DUB control wells (columns 47–48) can give an initial sense of the activity of the DUBs. The results from the DOE and enzyme/substrate titrations indicates the reducing agent concentration selected for our buffer is sufficient for all DUBs included in the screen; however, the concentration of reducing agent could be increased if the reducing agent is suspected to be an issue.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>Efficient readout of assay plates at specific timepoints can be difficult with a large number of plates required for screening the entire compound library.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>This high-throughput screening campaign assessed a roughly 50,000 compound library against each DUB selected. In both the primary screen and dose-response screen this equated to upwards of 40 separate 1536 well plates. Timing of enzyme and substrate incubation with compound is important to keep consistent and exact for each plate. We observed that the time required for the readout of each plate was causing some plates at the end of the stack to incubate for a slightly longer period of time than the first plates being read. We found that addition of a STOP buffer to cease all enzymatic activity enabled us to stop the enzymatic reactions on each plate allowing us to better compare results from plate to plate when reading out the fluorescence values. For larger compound libraries with a larger number of plates required, or if running a similar size using 384 well plates, the use of this STOP buffer or something similar can permit the reactions on all plates to be stopped first and then read out without fear of variable incubation times between plates.</p>
