<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The translation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for pediatric solid tumors is limited by the lack of preclinical models that fully recapitulate solid tumor biology. We describe steps to implement neuroblastoma metastatic and orthotopic mouse models. We delineate an analysis pipeline to quantify the efficacy and determine the immunological characteristics of both CAR T and tumor cells in these models. Both mouse models can be applied to evaluate other experimental therapies for neuroblastoma.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a class="external-link" href="http://refhub.elsevier.com/S2666-1667(21)00648-1/sref5">Li et al. (2021)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Commonly used animal models</h3>
<p>The protocol below describes the steps to create metastatic or orthotopic neuroblastoma (NB) models in immunocompromised mice for preclinical testing of exogenous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Metastatic relapse is the major cause of death in NB. Hence, a metastatic NB mouse model that shows similar pattern of experimental metastasis as occurs in NB patients should be employed when interrogating novel therapies. An established orthotopic NB mouse model allows for spontaneous metastatic spread as well as the formation of a tumor microenvironment, which poses physical barriers and paracrine immune suppression on immune effector cells. It is thus conceivable that orthotopic NB models may be more difficult to eradicate with CAR T-cell therapy and represent a more challenging experimental system for testing novel therapies.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.2">Generation of luciferase-eGFP-expressing neuroblastoma cells</h3>
<p>To track tumor growth using bioluminescence imaging, human <i>MYCN</i>-amplified IMR-5 cells are transduced with viral vectors to stably express luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The IMR-5-luc-eGFP cell line is available under the material transfer agreement upon request from the lead contact.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.3">Isolation of T cells from healthy donors</h3>
<p>The isolation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from buffy coat by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation is previously described (<a href="#bib2">Fuss et al., 2009</a>). T cells are then enriched via immunomagnetic negative selection from PBMCs isolated from healthy donors and used for CAR T cell production. The ratios of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells varies between 0.3 to 4.5 in healthy donors. T cells are frozen in a liquid nitrogen tank in batches with 50 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per vial.</p>
<h3 id="sec1.4">Production of CAR-expressing lentivirus</h3>
<p>Lentiviral CAR-expression vectors can be produced in research labs or obtained from commercial vendors. In our lab, we isolated a glypican 2 (GPC2)-specific monoclonal antibody, CT3, and demonstrated that CAR T cells harboring the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of the CT3 antibody led to regression of NB in murine models. GPC2 is an oncofetal antigen selectively expressed on NB cells, and absent in normal tissues except testis (<a href="#bib1">Bosse et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib4">Li et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib6">Orentas et al., 2012</a>). Thus, this antigen is highly tumor specific and represents an ideal target for CAR T-cell therapy. We cloned the CT3 CAR transgene into a lentiviral vector, pWPT (Addgene #12255, a gift from Didier Trono), to construct the final CAR vector pMH303 that can be used for other targets-directed CARs. The amino acid sequence of the CT3 CAR transgene is shown in <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>. In the present protocol, we use the second-generation CT3 CAR (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>) transduced into human T cells to demonstrate the usefulness of our preclinical models. The CT3 CAR construct (pMH303) contains 4-1BB as a co-stimulatory factor and the truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domains (hEGFRt) as a tag recognized by cetuximab. The pMH303 vector is available under a material transfer agreement upon request from the lead contact.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.5">Mouse strains</h3>
<p>We use 5 to 7-week-old female NOD-<i>scid IL2rg</i><sup><i>null</i></sup> (NSG) mice that are held in a specific pathogen-free environment. To obtain sex-independent results, a mix of male and female mice is highly recommended. NSG mice are severely immunocompromised because they lack mature B, T, and NK cells, thereby rendering them tolerant to xenografts.</p>

<section>
<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The data generated from these preclinical studies using the experimental metastasis and orthotopic with spontaneous metastasis NB models will provide information regarding the efficacy of tested CAR T cells against established tumors. Correlative studies can shed light on mechanisms of therapy failure, such as antigen down-regulation, limited persistence of effector cells, or physical barriers of CAR T cell homing, which can all contribute to immune evasion. Robust and reproducible results may accelerate a successful translation from the bench to bedside.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Accurate counting prior to the injection of tumor cells is critical for the success of the experiment. If too many cells are injected, animals will develop large tumors that do not respond to CAR T-cell therapy. This narrow therapeutic window can be logistically challenging if there are problems along the way of generating CAR T cells that delay T cell injection. Because patients with NB present with variable tumor burden, we are aware that our model does not reflect the quantitative heterogeneity encountered in the clinic. Moreover, CAR T cell reconstituted NSG mice lack other cells of the immune system, particularly innate immune cells that play a critical role in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and anti-tumor immunity. Thus, syngeneic animal models would be more suitable for comprehensive studies of immune interactions.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The mouse dies quickly after tail vein injection of CAR T cells or tumor cells (step 1).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are two main reasons that could lead to an early death after cell injection. Reason 1: The cell suspension may contain aggregated cells, which form an embolus and occlude vessels in the mice, ultimately causing, for example, cardiac congestion or stroke. Reason 2: The cell suspension contains air bubbles that cause an air embolism leading to similar symptoms as a cell embolus. Therefore, the injection of a single cell and air-free suspension is critical to avoid lethality related to cell injections.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The mouse succumbs during the orthotopic injection (step 7d).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Death during orthotopic implantation could be caused by internal bleeding after puncturing the aorta, which is located dorsal and medial to the adrenal fat pad. The use of mice aged 6 weeks or younger may facilitate the injection and avoid this complication because the fat pad has not involuted yet, which occurs with increasing age.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>A mouse dies after the orthotopic implantation though there is no evidence of injury to the aorta (step 7f).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The mouse may not awake after the orthotopic implantation due to issues with the anesthesia. To avoid prolonged or excessive anesthesia, mice should be kept for &lt;5 min in the anesthesia chamber. Since mice are also sensitive to body temperature changes, the use of a heating lamp or pad may maintain an adequate body core temperature during the procedure.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>The recommended functional titer is ≥ 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> TU/mL, while a titer below 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> TU/mL is considered as low (step 12).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>There are a few factors affecting lentivirus titer: 1) Lenti-X™ 293T cells need to be healthy and actively dividing at early passages. 2) High quality endotoxin-free transfer, envelope and packaging plasmids are important for optimal transfection efficiency. 3) Different transfer plasmids can affect titer, and the ratios of plasmids to transfection reagent may need to be optimized.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>CAR T cell expansion is slow during the culture (step 15).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We observed that T cells enter in the phase of rapid expansion from day 6 post-activation. Supplementation of IL-2 is required at least every other day even if new culture medium is not added into the culture. If T cell expand less than 10-fold on day 9 of culture with appropriate IL-2 supplementation, selection of another T cell donor is necessary for CAR T cell production.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.11">Problem 6</h3>
<p>Mice may develop symptoms of GvHD (&gt;15% weight loss, hunched posture, fur loss, and reduced mobility), thereby reaching a humane endpoint before the end of the experiment, which can add a variable of efficacy outcomes (step 21).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.12">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We observed that mice injected with both mock or CAR T cells can develop GvHD. The occurrence of GvHD correlates with the injected T cell dose. Thus, selecting a T cell donor that can yield high transduction efficiencies can delay the onset of GvHD because less total numbers of T cells are transferred for reconstitution.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.13">Problem 7</h3>
<p>The CAR T cell therapy shows a trend but no significant efficacy compared to controls (end-of-study evaluations).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.14">Potential solution</h3>
<p>We optimized the tumor and CAR T cell dose in this model to treat animals in the therapeutic window and yield a therapeutic effect. However, the therapeutic window may be missed if the tumor burden is too large at the time of therapy or the effector cell number is too low. Thus, the timing of CAR T cell injection may have to be moved up or vice versa, the dose of CAR T cells increased to observe a therapeutic effect.</p>
