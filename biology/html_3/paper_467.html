<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This protocol allows repeated whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from individual rodent CA1 hippocampal neurons, followed by immunohistological labeling of the axon initial segment. This overcomes the need to maintain whole-cell recordings over the timescales required for homeostatic modification to cellular excitability, allowing for correlative analysis of the structure and function of neurons. Moreover, this protocol allows for paired analysis of physiological properties assessed before and after pharmacological treatment, thus providing increased statistical power, despite the relatively low-throughput nature of the recordings.</p>
<p>For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to <a href="#bib3">Booker et al. (2020a)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="sec1.1">Acute hippocampal brain slice preparation</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min</div>
<p>Full protocols for the preparation of acute brain slices in our research group have been previously described (<a href="#bib4">Booker et al., 2014</a>, <a href="#bib2">Booker et al., 2017</a>, <a href="#bib3">Booker et al., 2020a</a>, <a href="#bib1">Booker, 2020b</a>). This protocol is not in specific chronological order, but rather with respect to each experimental aspect, in their respective order. It is more efficient to perform a number of days of electrophysiological recording, followed by subsequent batch processing of tissue and images. Briefly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare holding chamber:
<ol type="a">
<li>Obtain plastic inserts to form 2 compartments in the chamber, one for holding slices and one to place carbogen bubbler:
<ol type="i">
<li>A cylindrical plastic insert of 2.5 cm diameter and 2 cm height can be obtained by cutting a 50 mL syringe.</li>
<li>From a 20 mL syringe, remove the plunger and the cut off top portion of the syringe body. Cut off the syringe tip and make small holes in the bottom of the syringe (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>B).

<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> A heated scalpel blade can be used to more easily cut through the plastic.</div>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Build holding compartment by stretching mesh over the smaller cylinder and applying superglue (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>C).</li>
<li>Once superglue has dried, cut excess mesh to match the diameter of the plastic insert (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>D).</li>

<li>Prepare high-sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) for slicing:
<ol type="a">
<li>Place ∼200 mL sucrose-ACSF into a glass flask and put into a freezer at −20°C for ∼30 min prior to preparation of acute slices. This will allow partial freezing of sucrose-ACSF to form a slushy consistency.</li>
<li>Fill a submerged slice holding chamber with sucrose-ACSF in a water bath at 35°C and aspirate with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>The protocol described here allows for multiple recordings from identified CA1 pyramidal cells both before and after a prolonged treatment with a depolarizing stimulus and the appropriate osmotic control (i.e., 15 mM KCl and 15 mM NaCl, respectively) as we have recently employed (<a href="#bib3">Booker et al., 2020a</a>). This approach allows for a highly correlated physiological characterization of the effects of long-term treatment, overcoming cell-to-cell or slice-to-slice variability that is inherent to recording from different cells for each treatment. Following recording, the brief fixation and immunohistochemistry protocol used then allows for visualization of recorded neurons and the AIS in the same slices, thus allowing for correlated structural analysis of the same tissue that has undergone this depolarizing treatment. Approximately 1–2 neurons per slice are able to be successfully re-patched, as described here.</p>
<p>From whole-cell patch-clamp recordings it is possible to obtain detailed electrophysiological measurements of cell excitability, such as active firing properties, action potential kinetics, and passive membrane properties (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>). By incorporating a fluorescent dye into the intracellular recording solution, this allows for identification of the recorded neurons following treatment of the slice outside of the recording chamber, and facilitates repeated whole-cell recording of the same cells (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). Based on this protocol and our recent study (<a href="#bib3">Booker et al., 2020a</a>), these repeated patch-clamp recordings minimally affect cellular physiology as indicated by minimal change in excitability when treated with the physiologically inert 15 mM NaCl osmotic control (<a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a>, <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>A) and is useful in identifying physiological changes following 15 mM KCl treatment (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>B).</p>

<p class="table-legend">Data are shown as the mean ± SEM from 10 CA1 pyramidal cells from 5 mice. Statistics are reported from Student’s 2-tailed paired t tests. These data have been re-analyzed from recordings reported previously (<a href="#bib3">Booker et al., 2020a</a>).</p>
<p>Provided that good slice quality is maintained (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B), then it is possible to record multiple cells per slices before and after treatment. However, the technical ability of the experimenter will determine the number of cells that can be recorded in a given slice within the shortest possible time frame. An important consideration is to compare the values obtained in starting recordings from those performed without the time constraints of repeated whole-cell patch-clamp experiments (i.e., under true control conditions). It is critical that either vehicle or osmotic controls are included in any such experiment, to discount the effect of repeated whole-cell recording on the specific physiological parameter being measured.</p>
<p>Following recordings, our protocol provides a method to perform high-resolution imaging of the AIS from slices that have undergone depolarizing treatment and recording. If labeling has been successful it is expected that highly intense labeling for AnkyrinG is observed in the proximal portion of <i>stratum oriens</i> in CA1 (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a>, <a href="#fig6">6</a>, and <a href="#fig7">7</a>). When viewed under high-power magnification this labeling is due to the presence of a high number of immunolabeled AIS that often emerge from the base of the CA1 pyramidal cell somata and extend ∼20–40 μm into <i>stratum oriens</i>. It is expected that the AIS begins as a wide structure (2–3 μm) and tapers to a fine ending (&lt;0.5 μm), forming a conical structure, spines are sometimes observed emanating from the AIS. Occasionally, the AIS emerges from a proximal dendrite (<a href="#bib13">Thome et al., 2014</a>), as observed by weak NeuN labeling that fills the proximal dendritic cytoplasm. Based on this quality of labeling, it is possible to reconstruct the AIS for analysis of its length, surface area, width, and starting location relative to the soma in 3-dimensions (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>).</p>

<h2 id="quantification-and-statistical-analysis">Quantification and statistical analysis</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">Electrophysiology analysis</h3>
<p>Analysis of electrophysiological data was performed using Stimfit (<a href="#bib8">Guzman et al 2014</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Passive membrane properties were measured from the voltage response to a small hyperpolarizing current step (−10 pA, <a href="#fig8">Figures 8</a>A and 8C):
<ol type="a">
<li>Membrane time constant was determined by fitting of a monoexponential curve to the initial voltage response using the “fit function to data” tool.</li>
<li>Peak cursors were set to the final 100 ms of the current step allowing to determine the steady state voltage response to the current step and subsequently calculate input resistance according to Ohm’s Law.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>AP kinetics and AP discharge were quantified from the voltage response to a family of depolarizing current steps from −100 to +400 pA in 25 pA increments.
<ol type="a">
<li>AP kinetics were analyzed for the first AP elicited and measured from threshold set as 20 mV/ms:</li>
<li>Once peak cursors are set to flank the desired AP (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>D), the batch analysis tool can be used to measure kinetic properties including half-height duration, AP threshold and AP rise and decay rates (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>E).</li>
<li>AP discharge was quantified by selecting all traces and using the “batch analysis” tool to count the number of threshold crossings for each current injection step.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sec5.2">AIS length analysis</h3>
<ol start="3">
<li>Import microscope image files to FIJI (Image J).</li>
<li>AISs can be reliably measured by scrolling through the 3D z stack and manually tracing each AIS from the proximal to distal end. Tracing can be achieved using the segmented line tool: double click at the proximal end of the AIS to initiate tracing, use single clicks to mark points throughout the length of the AIS and allow for changes in direction, double click again at the distal end of the AIS to terminate the region of interest (ROI).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Avoid tracing AISs that are cut at the surface of the slice or at the edges of the field of the image (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a>B and 6C).</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Once an AIS has been traced it can be added to the ROI manager by pressing “T” on the keyboard.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 4 and 5 until a suitable number of AISs have been traced (in our study we analyzed 50 per image and 2 images per treatment condition for each mouse). This creates a list of ROIs correspondent to the traced AISs.</li>
<li>Select all ROIs in ROI manager and measure AIS lengths using the “Measure” button.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> ROIs and respective measurements can be saved as .zip and .csv files respectively for future reference.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Alternative semi-automated methods for AIS measurement have been employed by others (<a href="#bib6">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</a>, <a href="#bib7">Gutzmann et al., 2014</a>, <a href="#bib10">Pan-Vazquez et al., 2020</a>). While these provide a time efficient alternative to manual tracing of individual AISs their accuracy should be validated against manual measurements for your own labeling and imaging conditions.</div>
<h3 id="sec5.3">Three-dimensional reconstruction of AIS</h3>
<p>The AIS was reconstructed in 3 dimensions to allow for surface rendering, similar to previous reports (<a href="#bib5">Favuzzi et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Deconvolve images using Huygens Essential software package.
<ol type="a">
<li>Import microscope images (including header file information) into Huygens Essential software (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>A).</li>

</ol>

</ol>
<h3 id="sec5.4">Statistical analysis of electrophysiology data</h3>
<p>Given the paired nature of experiments from control and treatment conditions, paired statistical analysis should be performed to take into account the power obtained by performing repeated patch-clamp recordings.</p>
<p>Power analysis to calculate the required sample sizes to detect a difference in rheobase between control and treated recordings revealed a paired t test would require a sample size of 16 cells to detect a difference between groups, while an unpaired T test would require a sample size of 44 cells per group. Power calculation was performed assuming 95% power, 95% confidence interval and based on the standard deviation and mean rheobase values from control and KCl treated slices in WT mice published in our previous study (control: 159 ± 54 pA, KCl: 221 ± 99 pA, mean ± SD, <a href="#bib3">Booker et al 2020a</a>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, to avoid potential pseudoreplication effects when multiple recordings per animal are performed, mixed effects modeling is the most appropriate method to test for statistical differences (LMER function, R Studio).</p>
<h3 id="sec5.5">Statistical analysis of AIS length data</h3>
<p>First, to assess AIS length distributions across treatment conditions we performed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, based on the average cumulative distribution. This was performed on cumulative distributions in which the AIS lengths from each animal were binned (e.g., into bins of 0.5–1 μm, dependent on variability). Once binned, each histogram was averaged between animals across bins, to allow direct comparison (<a href="#bib3">Booker et al., 2020a</a>).</p>
<p>For statistical comparison of AIS length under control and treatment conditions an average of AIS length should be obtained for each condition and each animal and a parametric or non-parametric test performed as appropriate. Ideally, a linear mixed effect model should be applied to compare AIS length across treatments, with “Treatment” as a fixed effect and “animal” and “slice/section” selected as random effects.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>There are a number of technical and conceptual limitations to the current protocol. First, there is an inherent risk of damage to the slice each time it is handled. This can be overcome by using a wide-mouth transfer pipette and ensuring that all pumps are turned off before introducing the slice to the chamber</p>
<p>Second, slice health deteriorates over time, thus limiting the length of treatment that can be tested. Adaptation of this protocol to organotypic slices might allow for longer treatment windows.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not always possible to label the AIS of the recorded cell, depending how deep in the tissue the cell was located. Resectioning of the slices into thinner sections could circumvent this limitation but it might compromise recovery of cell morphology.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the low data throughput. Multiple cells per slice need to be recorded pre-treatment in order to maximize the chance of being able to patch from these again.</p>
<p>Finally, this approach may not be the most efficient for shorter pharmacological or plasticity treatments (&lt;1 h), in which case continual recording may be more appropriate. This should be decided during the experimental design and take into account the above factors.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec7.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>Recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells are not reliably of high quality and cells do not form reliable seals (steps 9 and 10).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The most likely cause is poor slice quality. To remedy this, decrease the time it takes to remove the brain and place in ice-cold sucrose-ACSF and take greater care when handling the brain during placement in slicing chamber. Healthy slices should display multiple ovoid neurons located near to the slice surface (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>B).</p>
<p>Also, double check if the solution composition is correct. Check the pH and osmolarity of solutions used for recording, as equilibrated with carbogen and warmed at the time of recording. Ideal pH should be 7.3 to 7.4 when measured at 30°C and osmolarity should be 290–310 mOsm.</p>
<h3 id="sec7.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>Following 3 h of depolarization or osmotic control, no fluorescently labeled cells are present in the slice (step 17).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Check the following possibilities:</p>
<p>Is the slice in the same orientation as it was during the first recording session? Try turning the slice over and check for labeled cells.</p>
<p>Is a reliable gigaohm seal formed following first recording? Confirm the presence of the gigaohm seal by monitoring electrode retraction in the seal-test mode of the amplifier. Under IR-DIC confirm that the cell is maintained in the slice and that the nucleus has not been accidentally withdrawn as well (step 12).</p>
<p>Are the cells sufficiently deep within the slice, to prevent damage at the surface, from being stored for an extended period? Try to record from neurons that are embedded deeper within the slice.</p>
<p>Slice quality is not sufficient to maintain slices at 35°C for 3 h. See <a href="#sec7.1">Problem 1</a> for suggestions of improving slice quality.</p>
<p>Record from more cells. Not every neuron survives 3 h of treatment, despite best efforts. A minimum of 3 cells normally yields at least 1 cell following 3 h treatment.</p>
<p>Is the solution composition correct? Check the pH and osmolarity of solutions used for recording, as equilibrated with carbogen and warmed at the time of recording. Ideal pH should be 7.3 to 7.4 when measured at 30°C and osmolarity should be 290–310 mOsm</p>
<h3 id="sec7.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>No labeling for AnkyrinG is present in the slice (step 32; <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>C).</p>
<h3 id="sec7.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Are the confocal microscope imaging settings correct for the wavelengths required for excitation/emission of the used secondary antibodies? Does the confocal microscope detect the streptavidin labeling of the filled neurons? Confirm that the microscope is functioning correctly by imaging a known calibration standard (e.g., dye beads) or test samples in another microscope system (e.g., epifluorescent microscope)</p>
