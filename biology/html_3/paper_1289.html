<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Thin semiconductors attract huge interest due to their cost-effective, flexible, lightweight, and semi-transparent properties. Here, we present a protocol on the preparation of thin semiconductor via controlled crack-assisted layer exfoliation technique. The protocol details the fabrication procedure for producing thin monocrystalline semiconductors with thicknesses in the range of a few tens of micrometers from thick donor substrates. In addition, we describe proof-of-concept application of the thin semiconductors for photoelectrochemical water-splitting to produce hydrogen fuel.</p>

<p>Crack-assisted layer exfoliation method, which is also known as spalling process, can be used to produce thin semiconductor (&lt; 50 μm), which is not possible by the standard wafering method used in current industry. This approach is achieved by controlling the sub-surface crack propagation direction in brittle semiconductor donor substrates. It is not only simple and cost-effective, but also applicable to any brittle substrate such as Si, Ge, GaAs, GaN and InP. A monocrystalline semiconductor donor substrate serves as a starting material to produce the thin semiconductors. In this protocol, we used commercial mirror-polished 500 μm-thick n-type Czochralski (CZ) crystalline Si wafers (phosphorus doped, ρ = 1–10 Ω·cm) as a starting material. However, we also previously used this protocol in other monocrystalline semiconductor substrates such as GaAs and InP.</p>
<p>Further knowledge on thin semiconductor exfoliation procedure can be found in the literature (<a href="#bib2">Lee et al., 2020</a>, <a href="#bib1">2021</a>).</p>

<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 1 day</div>
<p>A number of approaches can be used to form the stressor layer on the Si donor substrate. For instance, sputter and electroplating processes are generally used in the crack-assisted layer exfoliation method (<a href="#bib2">Lee et al., 2020</a>). In this protocol, we used the electroplating process due to the highly controllability of the stress level and high deposition rates in a simple solution-based processing, whereas the sputter process demands complex vacuum processing technology. In the electroplating process, the residual stress of the deposited Ni stressor layer is strongly affected by the composition of electroplating solution. Especially, NiCl<sub>2</sub> solution is known to form Ni thin films with high residual stress. In the following steps, we describe the preparation of NiCl<sub>2</sub> based electroplating solutions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dissolve 22 g of H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> powder into 600 mL of deionized (DI) water (obtained using Millipore DI water purification system) in a glass beaker under magnetic stirring. Stirring should be continued until the solution turns transparent without any precipitates.</li>
<li>Add 86 g of nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O) into the mixed solution under constant magnetic stirring for more than 12 h until the solution turns green without any undissolved precipitates. Use parafilm to cover the glass beaker containing the mixed solution to avoid water evaporation.</li>

<h2 id="step-by-step-method-details">Step-by-step method details</h2>
<h3 id="sec3.1">Wafer cleaning</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 30 min</div>
<p>The first step for the crack-assisted layer exfoliation method involves a cleaning process of the Si donor substrate which is used as starting material to produce Si thin films. Conventional RCA standard clean 1 (RCA-1) cleaning process is used to remove organic residues on the surface of the Si donor substrate as below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the RCA-1 solution with 20 mL of NH<sub>4</sub>OH (27%), 20 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (30%), and 100 mL of DI water in a glass beaker.</li>
<li>Place the beaker on a hot plate and set the temperature to 40°C.</li>
<li>Place a Si donor substrate in the RCA-1 solution for 10 min (Some bubbles appear on the surface of the Si donor substrate in the RCA-1 solution)</li>
<li>Collect the Si donor substrate from the RCA-1 solution, and rinse it in copious amounts of DI water.</li>
<li>Collect the Si donor substrate from the DI water and blow-dry it using a nitrogen gun.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> After the RCA-1 cleaning process, a native oxide layer is formed on the surface of the Si donor substrate. Therefore, the surface is modified into a hydrophilic surface. This can be confirmed by placing a water droplet and observing the shape of the water droplet on the Si donor substrate. Hydrophilic surface tends to be wetted by water droplets.</div>
<h3 id="sec3.2">Seed layer deposition on the cleaned Si donor substrate</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 h</div>
<p>The following seed layer deposition process is an important step which leads to high adhesion between the Si donor substrate and Ni stressor layer deposited by electroplating process. To start the seed layer deposition process, the native oxide on the Si donor substrate should be removed via diluted HF solution. The removal of the native oxide on Si donor substrate enables high adhesion with the Ti seed layer. Ni stressor layer is immediately deposited on the Ti adhesion layer to avoid the oxidation of Ti layer upon atmospheric exposure. It is also noted that the unwanted Ti oxidation could also make it difficult to deposit Ni stressor layer via electroplating process due to an increased sheet resistance.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Prepare dilute HF solution (10%).</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Teflon beaker should be used to prepare dilute HF solution to avoid the corrosion of glass beakers with the HF.</div>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> In conducting the processing with HF solution, careful attention to safety is required. HF readily penetrates the skin and dissociates into fluoride ions, and destructs deep tissue layers as well as bone. Personal protective equipment such as plastic face shield, acid resistant apron and gloves (i.e., neoprene rubber glove) are imperative while using HF solution.</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Place the cleaned Si donor substrate in the diluted HF solution for 1 min to remove its surface native oxide.</li>
<li>Collect the Si donor substrate from the diluted HF solution and wash it with DI water.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The surface of Si donor substrate becomes hydrophobic after the removal of the native oxide by HF solution. The difference in the wetting property can be easily confirmed by placing a DI water droplet on the Si substrate.</div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Blow-dry the Si donor substrate with a nitrogen gun.</li>
<li>Additional air gun blowing steps can be used to remove any unwanted dust particles before placing the samples into the substrate holder for Ti evaporation.</li>
<li>Transfer the Si donor substrate to the e-beam evaporator chamber immediately.</li>
</ol>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The Si donor substrate should be immediately loaded in the e-beam evaporator after native oxide removal to avoid the re-formation of native oxide in the ambient environment and possible contamination.</div>
<ol start="12">
<li>Control the rotation speed of the substrate holder at 50 rpm during the evaporation process.</li>
<li>When the vacuum reaches 5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mbar, the evaporation of the Ti/Ni seed layer is carried out as described below.
<ol type="a">
<li>The first 100 nm of Ti is evaporated at a deposition rate of 0.5 Å/s for pre-deposition without opening the sample chuck barrier.</li>
<li>A 50 nm-thick Ti seed layer is deposited on the Si donor substrate at a deposition rate of 0.1–0.2 Å /s by opening the sample chuck barrier.</li>
<li>In the next step, 50 nm of Ni is deposited on the Ti-coated Si donor substrate at a deposition rate of 0.1–0.2 Å/s.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<span class="note-title">Note:</span> Due to the pre-deposition of Ti layer, the vacuum level in the evaporator may be further improved. In our case, the vacuum improved to 10<sup>−7</sup> mbar after Ti pre-deposition.</div>
<ol start="14">

<h3 id="sec3.3">Stressor layer deposition</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 h</div>
<p>For crack-assisted layer exfoliation method, high-tensile stressor film has to be deposited on the Si donor substrate. The stressor layer determines the crack initiation and crack propagation depth; therefore, it is important to determine the thickness and residual stress of the stressor layer. See the reference for detailed information on this (<a href="#bib4">Lee et al., 2016</a>).</p>

<span class="note-title">Note:</span> The value of the operating current density at which the electroplating process is conducted must be carefully optimized to achieve the thickness uniformity and optimal residual stress.

<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> At the start of the electroplating process, it is important to make sure the measured potential at pre-specified constant operating current density is sustained.

If this occurs, halt the electroplating process and assess the underlying problem. Some of the cases are described in the <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a> section.</div>
<div class="critical">

Any inconsistency with this, the Ni electroplating rate changes due to changes in cell resistances during the electroplating process. It makes it difficult to achieve thickness control of the Ni stressor layer and alters the crack initiation position. Note that a distance of 4 cm between the seed layer-coated Si substrate and the Pt counter electrode was applied in this experiment considering the electrode areas (e.g., diameter of 2–3 cm) and stressor layer uniformity.</div>
<div class="critical">
<span class="critical-title">Critical:</span> The teflon tape has to be carefully wrapped around the electrical wire connection and seed layer-coated Si donor substrate.

<p>Initial crack is formed in the Si donor substrate after the stressor layer deposition if the stressor layer has sufficient thickness. The initial crack at/near the stressor layer can be observed by naked eye. The initial crack can be further grown by applying external force or thermal annealing process. In this protocol, we describe the initial crack propagation by applying external force to exfoliate Si thin film from its donor substrate (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).

<h3 id="sec3.5">Stressor layer removal</h3>
<div class="timing">
<span class="timing-title">Timing:</span> 3 h</div>
<p>The stressor layer is used for sub-surface crack propagation to exfoliate thin Si from its donor substrate. The stressor layer also can be useful as the mechanical handling layer which helps to prevent breaking of the fragile thin Si. However, the stressor layer needs to be removed in some cases after the crack-assisted layer exfoliation method. For instance, the stressor layer can limit the further processing of the spalled thin films in the high temperature annealing process and the conventional CMOS-compatible fabrication process. Therefore, the stressor layer has to be properly removed without causing damage on the exfoliated thin Si. In this protocol, we described the wet-etching approaches to remove the electroplated Ni stressor layer.</p>
<ol start="32">

<p>Surface texturing on Si is a frequently used method to reduce the optical reflection at the surface for high performance solar conversion devices. Generally, micrometer sized random pyramid structure formation on the Si substrate with KOH solution is a standard procedure in Si processing. The wet-etching based surface texturing method is described below. It is noted that a cleaning process to remove residual potassium should also be accompanied due to the surface potassium induced critical performance degradation on the devices. The surface texturing process on thin Si also removes any surface defects formed after the crack-assisted exfoliation method.

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>This protocol provides the procedure for the exfoliation of monocrystalline thin Si with controlled thickness via sub-surface crack propagation. In this regard, we deposited the Ni stressor layer by controlling the thickness and stress level on the Si substrate. After Ni stressor layer deposition, a crack was initiated and propagated by an applied external force in the Si donor substrate. After that, thin Si (&lt; 50 μm) was exfoliated from the Si donor substrate without material loss. In addition, the free-standing thin Si which is compatible with conventional CMOS fabrication process was also demonstrated after a well-controlled Ni stressor layer removal process.</p>
<p>For photoelectrochemical water-splitting application, surface texturing and NiO<sub>x</sub> co-catalyst deposition were conducted on the thin Si. The resulting thin Si based photoelectrochemical cell exhibited an on-set potential and saturated photo-generated current density of 1.39 V and 23.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The capability for thin Si production not only adds flexibility to monocrystalline Si, but also results in cost-reduction from reduced material usage.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Thin Si with sub-50 μm thickness can be made via the crack-assisted layer exfoliation method. However, the thin Si is very vulnerable to external mechanical shocks and may result in low mechanical robustness. Therefore, careful handling of thin Si layers is necessary. Supporting substrates such as glass can also help to eliminate mechanical stress and shock during additional fabrication steps.</p>
<p>Although the crack assisted layer exfoliation method was demonstrated on thin monocrystalline semiconductors with sub 50 μm thickness, it was not realized on sub μm thickness. More delicate control and theoretical study are required to fabricate the sub μm thickness control via crack assisted layer exfoliation method.</p>
<p>Thin Si generally show low photo-current density compared to the thick Si (∼200 μm) due to low light absorption of Si compared to direct bandgap materials. This issue can be solved by surface texturing at the front and rear to induce light trapping effects. See the reference for more detailed information (<a href="#bib5">Massiot et al., 2020</a>).</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="sec6.1">Problem 1</h3>
<p>The separation of the electroplated Ni stressor layer and seed layer from the Si donor substrate after the electroplating process (step 25 in “<a href="#sec3.3">stressor layer deposition</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.2">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The Ni stressor layer may exfoliate itself together with the seed layer without resulting in crack initiation or propagation in the Si donor substrate due to insufficient adhesion between Ti seed layer and the Si substrate. It is required to carefully control the deposition of the seed layer on the Si substrate via e-beam/thermal evaporator under high vacuum and clean chamber. Clean the vacuum chamber if it has high residual coatings. Avoid the vacuum chamber if metal oxides are frequently used as evaporating sources.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.3">Problem 2</h3>
<p>The rise of the measured potential recorded by the potentiostat to unexpected high values after commencing the electrodeposition process. For instance, the measured potential drops to −10 V which is closer to the limitation of our potentiostat (step 25 in “<a href="#sec3.3">stressor layer deposition</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.4">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The sharp increase in the measured potential to unexpected high values is due to the separation of electrical connections to either working or counter electrodes. In that case, electrical connections to the working and Pt counter electrodes with electrical wires must be carefully checked. If Cu wire is used as the electrical connection, the Cu wire can be etched away by the Ni electroplating solution if exposed.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.5">Problem 3</h3>
<p>Partial or no exfoliation of thin Si at the Ni stressor layer deposited area during the crack-assisted exfoliation process (step 31 in “<a href="#sec3.4">crack-assisted layer exfoliation method</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.6">Potential solution</h3>
<p>Cleaning of any dust sitting on the seed layer before Ni electroplating by blowing with a nitrogen gun and/or ultrasonic cleaning.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.7">Problem 4</h3>
<p>High surface roughness on the fracture surface of thin Si and donor substrate after crack-assisted layer exfoliation method (step 31 in “<a href="#sec3.4">crack-assisted layer exfoliation method</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.8">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The high surface roughness of the fractured surface is due to the crack propagation in a skewed manner. To solve this problem, crack propagation speed and direction have to be carefully controlled by applying a gentle external force. Automation equipment to exfoliate the thin Si with constant speed is also recommended as shown in <a href="#bib6">Wie et al. (2018)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="sec6.9">Problem 5</h3>
<p>The thin Si is vulnerable to breakage from external mechanical shock and stress due an extremely reduced substrate thickness and edge chipping after stressor layer removal (step 35 in “<a href="#sec3.5">stressor layer removal</a>”).</p>
<h3 id="sec6.10">Potential solution</h3>
<p>The thin Si fabricated by crack-assisted layer exfoliation method frequently has edge chipping which leads to breakage of the thin Si. The edge chipping often works as the fracture originating point during additional fabrication processing. Cleaving and removal of the edge chipping before additional fabrication processes could help to increase the processing yield. As mentioned, attaching thin Si to rigid supporting substrates also helps to increase the processing yield during the additional fabrication processing.</p>
