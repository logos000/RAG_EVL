            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Advances in fluorescence microscopy (FM), electron microscopy (EM), and correlative light and EM (CLEM) offer unprecedented opportunities for studying diverse proteins and nanostructures involved in fundamental cell biology. It is now possible to visualize and quantify the spatial organization of cellular proteins and other macromolecules by FM, EM, and CLEM. However, tagging and tracking cellular proteins across size scales is restricted by the scarcity of methods for attaching appropriate reporter chemistries to target proteins. Namely, there are few genetic tags compatible with EM. To overcome these issues we developed Versatile Interacting Peptide (VIP) tags, genetically-encoded peptide tags that can be used to image proteins by fluorescence and EM. VIPER, a VIP tag, can be used to label cellular proteins with bright, photo-stable fluorophores for FM or electron-dense nanoparticles for EM. In this Bio-Protocol, we provide an instructional guide for implementing VIPER for imaging a cell-surface receptor by CLEM. This protocol is complemented by two other Bio-Protocols outlining the use of VIPER (Doh <em>et al.</em>, 2019a and 2019b).</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Multiple protein targets can be imaged at once by fluorescence microscopy (FM), electron microscopy (EM), or correlative light and EM (CLEM) (Giepmans <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Lucas <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Philimonenko <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Johnson <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Kim <em>et al.</em>, 2015). FM enables multi-color microscopy in both living and fixed cells, and acquiring data can be relatively fast and easy. However, EM offers better resolution for imaging nanoscale features, including cell receptors, membrane boundaries, neuronal connections (Hildebrand <em>et al.</em>, 2017), chromatin organization (Ou <em>et al.</em>, 2017), or the endocytic machinery (Sochacki <em>et al.</em>, 2017). We anticipate an increased reliance on multi-color, cross-platform imaging for investigating proteins associated with normal cell function and human diseases (Megason and Fraser, 2007; Lichtman <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Milne and Subramaniam, 2009; Muller and Heilemann, 2013; Plaza <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Kremer <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Lucocq <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Karreman <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Laine <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2017). Currently, most high-resolution imaging studies obtain protein-specific contrast with immunolabeling, which has known shortcomings (Berglund <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Bordeaux <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Baker, 2015; Bradbury and Pluckthun, 2015).<br/><br/>The central obstacle that has limited progress in multi-scale microscopy is the shortage of genetic tags for labeling proteins. There are a number of protein tags available for imaging proteins by FM, including fluorescent proteins and self-labeling enzyme tags (Sunbul and Yin, 2009; Hinner and Johnsson, 2010). However, there are few genetic tags for EM or CLEM (Ellisman <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Most EM tags rely on the oxidation of diaminobenzidine (DAB) to form a polymer that is stained with osmium tetroxide to generate contrast. Examples include APEX (Martell <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Lam <em>et al.</em>, 2015), miniSOG (Shu <em>et al.</em>, 2011), the tetracysteine tag (Gaietta <em>et al.</em>, 2002), and others (Kuipers <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Liss <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Among the DAB-reliant EM tags, miniSOG, FLIPPER (Kuipers <em>et al.</em>, 2015), and the tetracysteine tag are compatible with CLEM. However, DAB staining is finicky, and it can be difficult to localize the stain sufficiently to resolve targets. Further progress in multi-scale microscopy will require new methods for labeling proteins with EM- and CLEM-compatible reporters, such as quantum dots (Qdots) (Giepmans <em>et al.</em>, 2005) or FluoroNanogold<sup>TM</sup> particles (Takizawa <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/><br/>We recently described a new class of tags for multiscale microscopy called Versatile Interacting Peptide (VIP) tags (Tane <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Doh <em>et al.</em>, 2018). VIP tags use heterodimerizing coiled-coil peptides to label proteins. One coil is expressed as a fusion to the protein of interest. This coil has a partner, the probe peptide, that is conjugated to a reporter molecule to deliver protein-specific contrast. The probe peptide can be conjugated to a number of reporters, such as fluorophores, small molecules (<em>e.g.</em>, biotin), or nanoparticles. <br/><br/>In this Bio-Protocol, we outline the use of VIPER to image a transmembrane receptor by CLEM. VIPER is a VIP tag comprised of CoilE tag and CoilR probe peptide. In Procedure A, we describe the plating and transfection of cells to express a CoilE-tagged receptor: transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1-CoilE). Procedure B describes how to label a cell receptor with CoilR-biotin for subsequent detection with streptavidin-Qdot655. In Procedure C we have an illustrated guide on how to mount ITO coverslips to a slide holder for correlative fluorescence imaging. Procedure D describes image acquisition with a commercially available CLEM microscope, the FEI CorrSight<sup>TM</sup>. In Procedures E and F we describe methods for preparing samples for EM. Procedure G details the acquisition of SEM micrographs on a Helios Nanolab<sup>TM</sup> 660 EM. We additionally developed a quantitative image analysis pipeline for automated image segmentation on high magnification SEM images (see the Data Analysis section). This program runs in Matlab and reports the number of nanoparticles within a field of view in SEM micrographs.<br/><br/>This protocol is published in tandem with two supporting publications detailing the use of VIPER (Figure 1). Doh <em>et al.</em> (2019a) details how to generate CoilR probe peptides, including biotinylated CoilR. Doh <em>et al.</em> (2019b) describes imaging VIPER-labeled proteins in cells by FM. </p>

We used the CHO TRVb cell line because it does not express TfR1 or transferrin receptor 2 (McGraw <em>et al.</em>, 1987). After transfection, all TfR1 receptor will encode the C-terminal CoilE tag on the extracellular domain. <br/>  We recommend optimizing plating density and transfection conditions for each cell line. Refer to Thermo Fisherâs Protocol Pub No. MAN0007824 Rev 1.0 (Reference 23) for more information on transfection with Lipofectamine 2000. In our protocol, we recommend passaging cells on Day 1, transfecting cells on Day 2, and VIPER labeling cells on Day 3 (see Procedure B).<br/><strong><em>Recommendations for Protocol A:</em></strong><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li><em>Use sterile technique and work within a tissue culture (laminar flow) hood when working with live cells.</em> </li><li><em>When transfecting cells with a vector encoding a CoilE-tagged protein (</em><em>e.g.</em><em>, pcDNA3.1_TfR1-CoilE), we also recommend transfecting cells with an untagged protein to compare labeling specificity (</em><em>e.g.</em><em>, pcDNA3.1_TfR1).

Transfer the coverslip to the 6-well plate without flipping the coverslip over. Maintain this orientation during transfection, labeling, and processing.</li><li>Pre-coating coverslips with poly-L-lysine or other cell-surface treatments may be necessary to adhere cells to glass. CHO TRVb cells adhere to glass without additional support.</li></ol></li><li>Seed 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well (for CHO TRVb). Grow cells in Hamâs F12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS.

Biotinylated receptor is subsequently detected with a streptavidin-Qdot655 conjugate. The biotinylated receptor could be labeled with other streptavidin conjugates, such as streptavidin-gold. We counter-stained with fluorescent transferrin (Tf-AF488), the ligand of TfR1, to enable the rapid identification of transfected cells. Lastly, live cells were cooled to 4 Â°C to pause endocytosis during labeling of the cell-surface receptor. <br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Visually inspect each well on a tissue culture microscope to confirm that transfected cells are adherent, healthy, and 80-90% confluent.</li><li>Remove media and add 500 Î¼l of Live Cell Block Solution (Recipe 1) to each well.

This procedure uses a custom-machined aluminum slide to hold the ITO coverslips during imaging. This slide was created by Ingo Gestmann (FEI). The dimensions of the slide are 76 x 26 x 1.5 mm. The hole is 12 mm in diameter, which is compatible with the 22 x 22 mm ITO coverslips. There are likely commercially-available coverslip holders, but we have not tested any. The custom-machined aluminum slide (Figure 2) has a piece of coverglass glued with epoxy to one side (Side B). The other side remains open, with a circular chamber (Side A).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191029/20191029193506_7557.jpg" width="103"/><br/><strong>Figure 2. Diagram of the aluminum coverslip holder.</strong> Side A shows a circular hole. Side B has a rectangular piece of coverglass glued to cover the circular hole. This set-up allows the user to create an enclosed chamber of buffer by taping an ITO coverslip to side A.<br/><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Using a diamond-tipped scribe, scratch a small âFâ into the center of the ITO coverslip to create a fiducial marker. Make strokes roughly 1 cm in length. A larger fiducial generates better correlation later on during SEM, but it should still be fully visible through the hole in the aluminum slide (see Figure 3). The coverslip can be stabilized during this process by holding it down with fine point tweezers.<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>For multiple samples, use the scribe to make additional marks to enable quick differentiation of your samples.

Samples prepared in Procedures A-C are first imaged by confocal FM to identify fluorescent cells. Confocal FM is used to image VIPER fluorescence (Qdot655) and Tf-AF488 on the cell surface. During FM imaging, the FEI MAPS software enables the user to select and âmapâ cells for subsequent high-resolution imaging by scanning EM (SEM).

This feature enables labeled proteins to be quantified by algorithmic segmentation and counting of the Qdots. We recommend acquiring SEM images at high magnification (65,000x or 100,000x) for optimal particle detection and segmentation.<br/>  We developed a custom pipeline in Matlab (ver. R2017b) for automated detection and quantitation of particles in backscattered SEM images. We first detected bright objects of interest on a dark background by using morphological top-hat filtering. The object segmentation was performed using a succession of mathematical morphology operations. Briefly, automatic intensity thresholding was performed to detect Qdots. Clustered objects were separated using a seeded watershed transformation from the ultimate eroded results. Next, we counted the segmented single particles (n = 1), dimers (n = 2), and multimers (n &gt; 2). A representative micrograph before and after segmentation is provided in Figure 20.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191029/20191029203305_6449.jpg" width="174"/><br/><strong>Figure 20. Algorithmic segmentation and automated counting of Qdots on the cell surface.</strong> A. The original, unprocessed SEM micrograph acquired at 100,000x magnification is shown. Qdots appear as bright white dots on the cell surface, which appears dark gray. B. The micrograph in A was processed in Matlab to generate a counting mask. The red mask (red outline) indicates the objects detected by morphological top-hat filtering. The green mask (green outline) indicates the objects detected and separated using watershed transformation. Insets show a 3x magnification of the region indicated.<br/><br/>After the automated image processing, we visually inspected the segmentation to refine parameters and exclude objects falsely annotated as Qdots. False-annotations were rare, but typically result from irregular background, intensity variations, background artifacts, or errors in segmentation overlooked by the automated procedure described above. <br/>  The parameter sets were optimized to quantify Qdot655 in SEM micrographs acquired at 65,000x-100,000x magnification on an FEI Helios Nanolab<sup>TM</sup> 660 SEM instrument using a CBS detector. These parameters may need to be adjusted to identify particles depending on the image quality, resolution, or type of particle (<em>e.g.</em>, 10 nM gold or Qdot555). The âVIPER_object_detection.m" code requires two input parameters related to: (i) intensity (<em>i.e.</em>, âint_thresholdâ in VIPER_object_detection.m) and (ii) object size (âobj_sizeâ, âobj_size_filterâ in VIPER_object_detection.m). The intensity-related parameter should be changed if there are variations in intensity across the images. The object size parameter (âobj_sizeâ) will need to be adjusted if the detection particles are a different physical size (<em>e.g.</em>, large gold particles) or if the resolution varies (<em>i.e.</em>, pixel size). Also, the code includes filtering options for removing small objects. The âobj_size_filterâ can be adjusted to remove undersized annotations. These are the parameters that we used for our analysis of Qdot655 particles:<br/>int_threshold = 60; % intensity parameter;<br/>obj_size = 10; % object size parameter;<br/>obj_size_filter = 5; % filter for small size object.<br/>Here is a brief tutorial that describes how to run our custom analysis pipeline to detect and count particles (<em>i.e.</em>, Qdots) and to count the segmented particles:</p><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Copy the file '<a href="https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20190416/VIPER object detection.zip" target="_blank">VIPER_object_detection.m</a>' into the desired computer directory.</li><li>Within the same computer directory, make a folder titled './img/'.</li><li>Copy SEM images ('tiff' file format) under './img/'.</li><li>Run '<a href="https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20190416/VIPER object detection.zip" target="_blank">VIPER_object_detection.m</a>' in the command window in Matlab.</li><li>The program will start segmentation and count the objects.</li><li>The output file will provide the following information:<br/>qdot_count.csv: number of objects (single Qdots, dimers, multimers, N_total â¥ N_1 + N_2 x 2 + N_more x 3),<br/>[filename]-PTmask.mat: object mask,<br/>[filename]-Overlay.png: overlaid image with boundaries (red: objects, green: separated objects).</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30147">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Live Cell Block solution<br/>10% (v/v) FBS, 6% (w/v) BSA in Hamâs F12 media</li><li>Qdot Block solution<br/>10% FBS and 6% BSA in DPBS</li><li>Qdot Labeling solution<br/>6% (w/v) BSA in DPBS<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30148">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This work was funded by the OHSU School of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health (R01 GM122854).
