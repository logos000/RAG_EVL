            <h1>Real-time <em>in vivo</em> Imaging of LPS-induced Local Inflammation and Drug Deposition in NF-ÎºB Reporter Mice</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Artur  Schmidtchen, Manoj Puthia</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Wound, biomaterial, and surgical infections are all characterized by a localized and excessive inflammation, motivating the development of <em>in vivo</em> methods focused on the analysis of local immune events. However, current inflammation models, such as the commonly used <em>in vivo</em> models of endotoxin-induced inflammation are based on systemic, usually intraperitoneal, administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), causing endotoxin shock. Here, we describe a model of LPS-induced local inflammation in NF-ÎºB-RE-Luc reporter mice. LPS, alone or with added therapeutic substances, is delivered locally via a hydrogel which is deposited subcutaneously, providing a spatially defined environment, enabling <em>in vivo</em> bioimaging analyses of local NF-ÎºB activation. Evaluation of drug efficacy can be analyzed longitudinally in the same mouse, and using fluorescently labeled drugs, local drug deposition can be simultaneously analyzed, and correlated to the site of inflammation. Finally, the protocol can also be used to study retention and systemic release of the drug from locally deposited gels and other biomaterials.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>An excessive TLR response causes localized and sometimes disproportionate inflammation, as observed in different types of wound and biomaterial infections. These wound complications delay proper healing and increase the risk of severe infections and sepsis. Considering the latter, several experimental models of sepsis and endotoxin shock have been developed which study the development of systemic inflammation (Lewis <em>et al.</em>, 2016). There is however a need for models that address localized inflammatory events from a mechanistic and therapeutic perspective. Activation of the transcription factor NF-ÎºB is a key component of various inflammatory conditions, and hence, NF-ÎºB is considered an important therapeutic target (Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Real-time, longitudinal <em>in vivo</em> imaging of NF-ÎºB activation in NFÎºB-RE-Luc reporter mice is an important tool in studies on inflammatory disease and efficacy of drug treatments. NFÎºB-RE-Luc reporter mice carry a transgene containing NFÎºB-responsive elements from the CMVÎ± promoter placed upstream of a basal SV40 promoter, and a modified firefly luciferase cDNA (Carlsen <em>et al.</em>, 2002). This reporter element can be induced by LPS and TNF-Î± (Carlsen <em>et al.</em>, 2002), and provides an excellent <em>in vivo</em> tool to monitor transcriptional responses of NF-ÎºB. To achieve visualization of gene expression, luciferin, a substrate for luciferase, is administrated intraperitoneally to mice which in turn generate luminescent signals. Thereafter, <em>in vivo</em> imaging using IVIS spectrum is used for acquisition and analysis of the recorded signals.<br/> <br/>Here, we describe a model of LPS-induced local inflammation in NFÎºB-RE-Luc reporter mice. LPS, mixed in a hydroxyethyl cellulose hydrogel, is injected subcutaneously on the back of mouse. Subcutaneous deposition of hydrogel provides a defined and controlled environment for studies of local NF-ÎºB activation. In addition to LPS, therapeutic agents can also be included in the same hydrogel and their efficacy can be analyzed longitudinally in the same mouse. Moreover, drug deposition and release can also be imaged by using fluorescently labeled drugs. To evaluate local anti-inflammatory efficacy of a peptide drug and for imaging its local distribution, this <em>in vivo</em> imaging protocol has successfully been used by us (Puthia <em>et al.</em>, 2020).</p>

This can be achieved in an IVIS induction chamber or in any other isoflurane-oxygen delivery system. Shave hair from the dorsum (slightly below interscapular region) of mice with a cordless clipper. Depilation can also be achieved with depilatory creams. If depilatory creams are used, it should be performed at least 2 days prior to the subcutaneous injection.<br/><em>Note: Shaving or depilation is necessary as mouse hair can interfere with both luminescence and fluorescence imaging.</em> </li><li>Wipe and clean the dorsum with alcohol wipe.

Insert the needle under the skin and move forward at least 1 cm. Slowly, inject 100 Î¼l of LPS gel mixture, withdraw the needle and put your finger at the site of insertion to prevent any leakage from the site of deposition.<br/><em>Note: As mouse skin is quite loose, ensure that you inject gel in the midline otherwise gel maybe placed to one side. For standard subcutaneous injection procedure please see Shimizu (2004).</em> </li><li>Immediately after subcutaneous injection, transfer the mice to their respective cages.<br/><br/></li></ol></li><li>IVIS imaging for NF-ÎºB activity (luminescence imaging mode)<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Fifteen min prior to IVIS imaging, administer D-luciferin solution intraperitoneally into the mice (150 mg/kg body weight). Put the mice back to the cages.<br/><em>Note: We image mice 3, 6 and 24 h post subcutaneous deposition of LPS gel.</em> </li><li>Anesthetize mice in an induction chamber with 4% isoflurane-mixed oxygen. Complete anesthesia takes approximately 3-5 min.<br/><em>Note: Read IVIS spectrum user manual before using IVIS.</em> </li><li>Once the mice are anesthetized, start the isoflurane supply (2%) for the IVIS imaging chamber. Immediately, transfer mice to the imaging chamber.<br/><em>Note: Turn on IVIS and start Living Image software at least 15 min prior to the imaging and initialize it. Initialization process cools down the camera to -90 Â°C. Also ensure that stage heating (37 Â°C) is working.</em> </li><li>Place mice in prone position (backside up) on the stage. Position nose in nose cone for anesthesia.<br/><em>Note: Maximum five mice can be imaged at one time. If imaging more than one mouse at a time, ensure that there is minimum lag time between D-luciferin injections.

For in vivo and deep tissue imaging, it is important to note that wavelengths greater than 600 nm are preferred. Animal tissue absorbs significant amounts of light below wavelengths 600 nm.
