            <h1>HIV-CRISPR: A CRISPR/Cas9 Screening Method to Identify Genes Affecting HIV Replication</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ferdinand  Roesch, Molly OhAinle</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Screening with CRISPR/Cas9 technology has already led to significant discoveries in the fields of cancer biology, cell biology and virology. Because of the relatively low false discovery rates and the ability to perform high-throughput, pooled approaches, it has rapidly become the assay of choice for screening studies, including whole-genome screens. Here, we describe a CRISPR screening protocol that allows for efficient screening of the entire life cycle of HIV-1 through packaging of the HIV-CRISPR lentiviral genomes by infecting HIV-1 virus <em>in trans</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> HIV, CRISPR screen, Cofactors, Restriction factor, HIV-CRISPR, High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS)</p>
            <h2>Background</h2><p>Genetic screens are powerful tools to identify new genes affecting the replication of viruses, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Identification of host genes important in HIV infection allows for enhanced understanding of HIV replication, evolution, transmission and pathogenesis, key interests of the HIV field. In particular, the discovery of HIV restriction factors, which are often Interferon (IFN) Stimulated Genes (ISGs), has been a crucial development in the field of retrovirology in the last decade. High-throughput approaches to discover HIV restriction factors have focused on over-expression screens to identify broadly acting antiviral ISGs (Schoggins <em>et al.</em>, 2011) or acting specifically against HIV (Kane <em>et al.</em>, 2016). One whole-genome screen for HIV restriction factors was performed by transfecting pools of siRNA pools in target cells (Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2011). However, these methods lacked the robustness, versatility, and high-throughput aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens. Thus, we developed an innovative approach using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and relying on the ability of HIV to cross-package lentiviral genomes expressed in cells transduced with CRISPR/Cas9 libraries (OhAinle <em>et al.</em>, 2018). This protocol was used originally to discover ISGs that block HIV-1 infection in the monocytic cell line THP-1, using a library of 2000 ISGs we designed. However, it can be used with any single guide RNA (sgRNA) library (whole-genome or subsets of genes) that is synthesized and assembled into the HIV-CRISPR lentiviral backbone. HIV-CRISPR was constructed by replacing the U3-deleted Self-Inactivating (SIN) LTR in the lentiCRISPRv2 vector with the full-length LTR from HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub>. This modification allows for HIV-CRISPR genomic RNA to be transcribed and available for packaging <em>in trans</em> into HIV virions. It can be used with any human cell line permissive for lentiviral transduction and editing, and can be used to study a variety of HIV isolates, mutants or even other closely-related lentiviruses that can package the HIV-CRISPR lentiviral genomes <em>in trans</em>. Importantly, this protocol assesses key factors important to the life cycle of HIV, including late steps such as assembly or budding, which may not be examined by other approaches relying on the use of reporter viruses.</p>

If less than 33 ml viral supernatant is available, fill with DMEM media. Carefully add 4 ml of 20% sucrose solution to each SW28 Beckman Polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube with a 5 ml pipet. The tube should be filled up to 0.5 cm from the top to avoid collapsing during ultracentrifugation. Finish filling the tube with complete DMEM media as needed.</li><li>Load the SW28 ultracentrifuge tubes into a pre-chilled SW28 or SW32Ti rotor. Spin at 70,000 <em>x g</em> for 1 h at 4 Â°C.</li><li>Decant clarified viral supernatants and let tubes dry inverted on a paper towel for several minutes. Put each tube into a 50 ml conical tube and resuspend the (non-visible) pellets in the desired volume (from 200 Î¼l to 1 ml) and incubate at 4 Â°C.</li><li>After 15-60 min of incubation, vortex gently for 5 s. Incubate at 4 Â°C for several hours (or ideally overnight) with occasional vortexing.</li><li>Gently resuspend viral pellets in DMEM media using a 1 ml pipet (avoid generating bubbles), combine all supernatants, mix, aliquot and freeze at -80 Â°C.

The Colony Forming Assay used here will allow calculating the volume of lentiviral vector stock necessary to achieve the desired Multiplicity of Infection (MOI). Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) is a ratio of infectious particles to the number of cells and can be used to deliver a specific number of transducing lentiviral vectors on average to cells in culture.<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Day 0: cell plating<br/>Plate TZM-bl cells at 1.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in a 12-well plate (1 ml per well).</li><li>Day 1: virus infections<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Replace the media with 300 Î¼l of complete DMEM, with a final concentration of 20 Î¼g/ml DEAE-Dextran.</li><li>Thaw an aliquot of the HIV-CRISPR lentivector preparation.</li><li>Prepare the following HIV-CRISPR lentivector dilutions in duplicate in complete DMEM: 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:3,000, 1:10,000 (for example, dilute 20 Î¼l to 180 Î¼l for a 1:10 dilution, serial dilute from there)</li><li>Add 20 Î¼l of diluted lentivector per well of a 12-well plate in duplicate.</li><li>Infect cells by spin-infection (spinoculation) for 30 min at 1,100 <em>x g</em> at room temperature, using a tabletop centrifuge with swinging-bucket rotors/plate adapters.</li><li>Add 200 Î¼l media to well to fill to 500 Î¼l per well. Incubate cells overnight at 37 Â°C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.</li></ol></li><li>Day 2: puromycin selection<br/>Replace media with complete DMEM with 0.5 Î¼g/ml puromycin (1 ml per well).<br/><em>Note: Puromycin concentration is cell-type dependent and can be determined with a drug kill curve (see Step C2c).</em> </li><li>Day 3-Day 11: cell killing<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Replace the media with fresh Puromycin-containing DMEM media as needed to clear off dead cells until colonies of cells are visible and can be manually counted (typically in the 1: 1,000-1: 3,000 range).</li><li>Calculate the titer (Infectious Units/ml of lentiviral supernatant). For example, if 40 colonies are counted (on average) at the 1:1,000 dilution, this would be equivalent to 40,000 IU for 20 Î¼l of inoculum used in the titering assay. This is equal to 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> IU/ml in the lentiviral supernatant.</li></ol><br/></li></ol></li><li>HIV-CRISPR Library Transduction<br/>This step consists in the generation of a pool of cells stably expressing the Cas9 enzyme and the sgRNA library. Upon transduction with the lentiviral stock produced in Procedure A and quantified in Procedure B, each target cell will carry an integrated lentiviral HIV-CRISPR lentiviral genome encoding for Puromycin resistance, the Cas9 enzyme, and a specific sgRNA from the library.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Day 0: cell plating and transduction<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Plate the cells to be transduced in a 12-well plate. For adherent cells, cells should be at approximately 75% confluency. For suspension cells, use a concentration of 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well in 500 Î¼l in a 12-well.<br/><em>Note: Plate enough cells to ensure 500x coverage of the library, meaning that each sgRNA in the library is sampled a minimum of 500 times. To calculate the number of cells to transduce, multiply the number of individual sgRNAs in the library by 500. For example, the GeCKOv2 whole genome library that contains 123,411 sgRNAs: therefore, 62 x 10</em><sup><em>6</em></sup><em> transduced cells should be targeted.</em> </li><li>Add DEAE-Dextran to the media to make a final concentration of 20 Î¼g/ml to enhance transduction efficiency.<br/><em>Note: This concentration of DEAE-Dextran is optimal to enhance transduction of THP-1 cells. For other cell types, optimize this concentration with a dose response to ensure optimal transduction rates while minimizing cell toxicity.</em> </li><li>Add the appropriate volume of HIV-CRISPR library lentiviral vector to reach an MOI of 0.5-0.75, thereby allowing for a cell population post-selection in which only one sgRNA (and therefore gene knockout) is present in most cells in the population.</li><li>Infect cells by spin-infection (spinoculation) for 30 min at 1,100 <em>x g</em> at room temperature in a tabletop centrifuge with swing bucket rotors/plate adapters.

Make sure that no cells stay attached to the bottom of the well. For adherent cells, trypsinize the cells to remove the cells from the plate.</li><li>Pellet cells for 5 min at 1,000 <em>x g</em>.</li><li>Resuspend cell pellet at a final concentration of 5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in complete RPMI (or other media as appropriate) with 0.5 Î¼g/ml Puromycin (or other appropriate concentration).<br/><em>Note: This concentration of Puromycin was optimized for selection in THP-1 cells, and other concentration as appropriate for each cell type. We recommend using puromycin concentrations previously published in the literature for each cell type of interest, or as determined by a kill curve prior to the transduction. The kill curve is performed by adding increasing concentrations of puromycin on non-transduced cells, which allows determination of the minimal concentration necessary to kill 100% of cells after several days of puromycin selection in culture.</em> </li></ol></li><li>Day 2-Day 14: HIV-CRISPR cell library selection<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Continue puromycin selection for 10-14 days to select for transduced cells and to allow for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout to occur.</li><li>Replace the media every 2-3 days with complete media containing puromycin to expand the cells, always maintaining the cells under selection. Split cells when appropriate, always maintaining enough cells to ensure good coverage of the library (&gt; 500x).</li><li>When selection is complete, use cells for the experiment and freeze leftover cells in 90% FBS and 10% DMSO for future experiments.</li></ol><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>HIV-CRISPR Library Cell Infection<br/>Cells generated in Procedure C are infected by HIV in order to assess the effect of each single gene knock-out in the library of cells on HIV replication.

Accurate quantification of library DNA is done with the Qubit dsDNA HS Kit and will be enhanced by calibrating the fluorometer with the provided calibration standards each time the assay is performed.

However, depending on the screen, a miSeq can be adequate. The sequencing depth required will depend on a number of factors, including the precise experimental setup, strength of selection and efficiency of nucleic acid extraction/amplification/clean-up. Typically, we obtain 1-5 million reads per sample, which is more than sufficient. More information on how to determine appropriate sequencing depth can be found on the manufacturerâs website: </em><a href="http://illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/plan-experiments/coverage.html" target="_blank"><em>Illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/plan-experiments/coverage.html</em></a><em>.</em> </li><li><em>Adding PhiX DNA may be necessary to avoid sequence quality issues caused by the low diversity samples, a common problem in amplicon sequencing. A PhiX spike of at least 20% is a useful starting point and can be optimized further in order to gain additional sequencing depth of the samples. Because 50 cycles are sufficient for HIV-CRISPR sequencing with the current amplification protocol/primer sets, we use the HiSeq or miSeq on a Single-Read 50 (SR50) setting.</em><br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>HIV-CRISPR Screen Analysis<br/>A variety of data analysis methods can be used to analyze CRISPR screen data. The goal of this protocol is to identify genes affecting HIV replication: therefore, our data analysis approach aims at calculating which gene knock-out leads to increased or reduced HIV infection. To do this, we calculate the relative frequency of each sgRNA sequence in HIV-CRISPR genomes packaged in virions as compared to sgRNA sequences encoded in HIV-CRISPR genomes integrated in cells. The assumption is that sgRNAs targeting antiviral factors will be enriched in the virions and sgRNAs targeting cofactors that are required for or that enhance infection will be depleted in the viral fraction. Statistical methods explained below allow to take into account all the sgRNAs targeting a single gene to assign a score to each gene.<br/>  An example analysis pipeline: Raw BCL files are converted to FASTQ files using the bcl2fastq conversion software from Illumina. FATSQ files are then demultiplexed to assign reads to the different samples, using FASTX Toolkit Barcode Splitter. For each sample, reads are then trimmed to the 20 bp variant sgRNA sequence and aligned to the sgRNA library using Bowtie (Langmead <em>et al.</em>, 2009). As a negative control, NTC (Non-Targeting Control) sgRNA sequences can be iteratively binned to create an NTC sgRNA gene set as large the set of genes in the sgRNA library itself. Relative enrichment or depletion of sgRNAs and gene scores are determined with the MAGeCK statistical package using default parameters (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2014). MAGeCK takes into account the enrichment of all sgRNAs for a gene across replicates to assign a MAGeCK Gene Score for each gene. Examples of analyzed datasets can be found in our original publication (OhAinle <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/><em>Note: Replicate CRISPR/Cas9 screens tend to generate reproducible results (r<sup>2</sup> values of &gt; 0.9 for gDNA replicates and &gt; 0.8 for vRNA replicates can be achieved). The most robust hits are those hits that are conserved across experiments. Variability in the results can be due to a lack of sampling of the library at various steps in the process: adequate infection of cells, efficient nucleic acid extraction, sequencing depth (</em><em>i.e.</em><em>, insufficient read depth), or other experimental variables. The correlation between replicates, the degree of enrichment of Non-Targeting Control (NTC) sgRNAs, the overall MAGeCK Gene Scores, p-value and False Discovery Rate (FDR) of top scoring hits (as compared to the âNTC gene setâ) are good indicators of the quality of the data generated. However, any hits identified must be validated to determine a true cutoff of signal to noise (</em><em>i.e.</em><em>, empirically-derived). To avoid the risk of contamination, fresh kits and reagents are used where possible.</em><br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti33109">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>10x Tris/Borate/EDTA (TBE) running buffer (500 ml)<br/>54 g of Tris base<br/>27.5 g of boric acid<br/>20 ml of 0.5 M EDTA<br/>Adjust the pH to 8.3 by adding HCl<br/>Dilute to 1x in water prior to electrophoresis</li><li>20% sucrose solution (200 ml)<br/>40 g sucrose<br/>400 Î¼l 0.5 M EDTA<br/>4 ml 1 M HEPES <br/>5 ml 4 M NaCl<br/>Filter using Steriflip 50 ml conical tubes and keep sterile at 4 Â°C for up to a year<br/>The EDTA stock is kept at 4 Â°C<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti33110">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This protocol was first described in OhAinle <em>et al.</em> (2018).
