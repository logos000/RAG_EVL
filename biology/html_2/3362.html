            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The enrichment of lysosomes is a useful way to study their structure and function. These dynamic vesicles can be enriched from cell cultures in a variety of ways including immunoprecipitation and fluorescence-activated organelle sorting. These methods are extremely precise but often require the transfection and expression of an affinity or fluorophore-tagged lysosomal membrane protein. A simpler approach uses differential density of subcellular organelles, which are characteristic to a particular type of organelle. Separation of organelles along a density-gradient enables fractionation to enrich for specific organelles (such as lysosomes) in their native state. This protocol outlines an optimized method for enriching lysosomes from HeLa cells with a continuous density-gradient that contains Percoll. Gentle cell lysis and extraction conditions yield dense-fractions that are enriched with functional and intact lysosomes, which can be assayed in downstream analyses. This method is quick (conducted in less than 2 h after harvesting cells), and can be easily scaled and optimized for other cell types.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The lysosomal system is the cellâs recycling center and is responsible for breaking down macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. This system is responsible for quality control and is one of the cellâs front-line defenses against aging. As such, researching lysosomal function has found application in age-related diseases such as Alzheimerâs and Parkinsonâs disease, which are both genetically associated with the lysosomal system (Gao <em>et al.</em>, 2018), and display profound lysosomal system dysfunction (Whyte <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The enrichment or purification of cellular organelles that are a part of the lysosomal system is a powerful way to study their structure and function. <br/><br/>Enrichment of subcellular structures such as lysosomes and related organelles from cell cultures can be conducted in a variety of ways including immunoprecipitation, fluorescence-activated organelle sorting, and magnetic separation of organelles that contain superparamagnetic iron nanoparticles (Gauthier <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Abu-Remaileh <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Lloyd-Lewis <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Whilst being extremely precise these methods often require the transfection and expression of an affinity or fluorophore-tagged lysosomal membrane protein (<em>e.g.</em>, LAMP1, LAMP2 or TMEM192). Density-gradients offer an alternative simple approach that takes advantage of the different densities of specific organelles. <br/><br/>The use of Percoll for the creation of density gradients with which cells can be fractionated and organelles enriched is an easy-to-use and well-established method (Pertoft <em>et al.</em>, 1978). Separation of cell lysates along a density-gradient enables fractionation to enrich for specific organelles (such as lysosomes) in their native state. Percoll media itself is made of polydisperse silica particles that are coated in polyvinylpyrrolidone that have an average size in water of 35 nm. One of the main advantages of using Percoll above other media is that it has a low osmolality. Osmolality does not change with respect to position in a Percoll gradient. This contrasts with sucrose gradients, and even Ficoll (sucrose polymer) gradients that change in osmolality with respect to position in the density gradient (Pertoft, 2000).<br/><br/>This protocol outlines an optimized method for enriching lysosomes from HeLa cells with a density-gradient that contains Percoll (summarized in Figure 1A). Gentle extraction conditions yield dense-fractions that are enriched with functional and intact lysosomes. These fractions can be measured for lysosomal proteins and lysosomal enzyme activity (Cui <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This method is quick (<em>i.e.</em>, can be performed in &lt; 2 h after harvesting cells), and can be easily scaled for size and optimized for other cell types.<br/></p>

Activity and protein analysis can be performed on neat samples taken from Percoll fractions. For example, analyze each fraction by Western blot, probing for the lysosome marker LAMP1 (Figure 1B). Analysis of the cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) is useful as this receptor is present on endosomes but not lysosomes (Cheng <em>et al</em>., 2018), evident in fractions 13-18. Additionally, activity of lysosomal enzymes (such as Î²-hexosaminidase, Î²-glucocerebrosidase, Î²-galactosidase, and acid phosphatase) can be used to detect lysosomal fractions (Figure 1C) (Leaback and Walker, 1961; Kolodny and Mumford, 1976). If cell lysis was too vigorous and lysosomes were burst open, this will be revealed as a âflatâ Î²-hexosaminidase profile across the fractions as opposed to a profile that peaks in the denser fractions. Cell components other than endosomes and lysosomes will be present in this gradient as well. For example, plasma membrane will be enriched in the lightest fractions (Perret <em>et al</em>., 1979). Endoplasmic reticulum will also appear in lighter fractions, and the Golgi apparatus will appear in intermediate fractions. Mitochondria may appear in heavier fractions and need to be considered as potential contaminants when purifying lysosomal fractions (Suhy <em>et al</em>., 2000).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916185559_7266.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Density-gradients yield subcellular fractions that are enriched with lysosomes.</strong> A. Schematic of experimental workflow. Briefly, cells are gently lysed by popping in a syringe and the soluble fraction layered on top of a Percoll/sucrose cushion. Ultra-centrifugation for 1 h at 30,000 <em>x g</em> at 4 Â°C will distribute organelles along the gradient in a density-dependent manner. Top-to-bottom fractionation is used to separate organelles based on their sedimentation profile. Less dense organelles (such as early endosomes) sediment toward the top of the gradient, whereas denser organelles (such as late endosomes and lysosomes) sediment toward to bottom of the gradient. B. Western blot analysis of density-gradient fractions (#1-19; out of 19) from HeLa cells. Blots were probed for the late endosome/lysosome marker LAMP1. Note that LAMP1 is enriched in high-density fractions #13-18. C. Activity analysis of lysosomal enzymes across density-gradient fractions (#1-16; out of 16). Note that for all enzymes there is increased activity in high-density fractions #13-15. Data presented is the mean of three independent experiments. <br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190916/20190916185618_8947.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.
