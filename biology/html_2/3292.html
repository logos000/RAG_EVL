            <h1>Gentamicin Protection Assay to Determine the Number of Intracellular Bacteria during Infection of Human TC7 Intestinal Epithelial Cells by <em>Shigella flexneri</em></h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Atin Sharma, Andrea Puhar</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><em>Shigella flexneri</em> is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that gains access to the gut epithelium using a specialized Type III Secretion System (T3SS). Various determinants mediating this invasive infection have been experimentally verified using the classical gentamicin protection assay presented here. In this assay epithelial cell lines are infected by bacteria <em>in vitro</em> and the extracellular bacteria are killed by gentamicin. The internalized bacteria, which are protected from the bactericidal action of gentamicin, are recovered by lysing the epithelial cells and enumerated by determining the colonies formed on solid medium. Various techniques based on light microscopy, such as immunofluorescence and bacteria expressing fluorescent proteins, are also used for studying intracellular bacteria. However, these techniques are not only labor intensive and require sophisticated equipment, but mostly are also not quantitative. Despite being an easy quantitative method to study invasiveness of bacteria, the gentamicin protection assay cannot distinguish between the survival and multiplication of the internalized bacteria over longer incubation periods. To alleviate the complications created by multiplication and dissemination of internalized bacteria, complementary assays like plaque formation assays are required. This protocol presents an easy and cost-effective method to determine the invasiveness and the capacity to establish an infection of <em>Shigella</em> under different conditions.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><em>Shigella</em> infects about 160 million people leading to about 600,000 deaths every year (Reference 8). The clinical manifestations of <em>Shigella</em> infection, or shigellosis, arise only after the bacterium enters the epithelium, where it multiplies and spreads to adjacent cells causing cell death and tissue necrosis. Thus, the entry into the epithelial cells is a critical step in the infectious life cycle of <em>Shigella</em> (Ashida <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Most of the determinants mediating this step have been ascribed to a large virulence plasmid that encodes a T3SS responsible for injecting bacterial proteins into the host cell via a needle-like projection (Puhar and Sansonetti, 2014).<br/><br/>The gentamicin protection assay is a classical method that is used to assess the invasiveness of <em>Shigella</em> and has led to the identification of a number of mediators of invasion by mutational analysis and comparisons with the wild-type bacteria. In a typical experiment, the bacteria are allowed to infect the intestinal cells in a synchronized manner followed by removal of external bacteria by gentamicin treatment. The invasiveness is assessed by determining the number of surviving bacteria (protected from gentamicin being intracellular) from the lysates of infected cells. A lower number of surviving bacteria with respect to the wild-type indicates a defect in invasion or intracellular survival. If short infection times are used after the gentamicin treatment (typically 1h), the gentamicin protection assay allows to compare the bacterial capacity to enter host cells only. However, if longer infection times are used after gentamicin treatment (2 h or more), the assay will also reflect the bacterial capacity to survive and multiply within the target cell besides the capacity to invade. Hence, if the gentamicin protection assay is employed to study the capacity to survive and multiply by allowing long infection times, these experiments should always be complemented with tests carried out at short infection times to ensure correct interpretation of the results. The gentamicin protection assay, however, is not suitable to assess the extent of intercellular spread of bacteria throughout the monolayer, which is conveniently determined by a plaque formation assay. Although the invasiveness of bacterial pathogens can also be studied by fluorescence microscopy-based techniques such as immunofluorescence and FACS; it requires the use of costly reagents like labeled probes, special reporter strains and sophisticated equipment. The gentamicin protection assay is not only relatively easy to perform and cheap, it is fairly rapid and less labor intensive making it amenable to higher throughput.<br/><br/>The protocol presented here reprises the classical gentamicin protection assay, which has been optimized for use with <em>Shigella flexneri</em> and TC7 intestinal epithelial cells but can be modified to be used with other intracellular pathogens and other host cell types.</p>

Monitor the OD<sub>600</sub> of the culture periodically. At OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6, withdraw 1 ml of culture in a 2 ml cryovial and add sterile glycerol to a concentration of 15-50% (v/v). Mix gently and store the tube at -80 Â°C. The frozen stocks are stable for years at -80 Â°C, however, multiple freeze-thaw cycles may reduce the shelf life.</li><li>Carefully select only the red colonies on Congo red agar for the experiment. The off-white colonies have lost the virulence plasmid and are invasion-deficient. If plates are not used immediately after overnight culture, but kept at 4 Â°C (which is possible for up to 3 weeks), white colonies need to be marked because they will turn red due to non-specific binding of Congo red. Red staining of invasive colonies only develops during growth above 35 Â°C.</li><li>Congo red is able to induce secretion via the Type III Secretion System (T3SS) in <em>Shigella</em>. The dye binds to the bacterial colonies that have an active T3SS making them appear red in color. It is a simple and quick screening method to differentiate virulent <em>Shigella</em> colonies from the avirulent ones (due to curing of the virulence plasmid). Unfortunately, the mechanism of action of Congo red is not understood.</li><li>The TC7 cells are cultured and maintained in presence of Penicillin and Streptomycin (100 U/ml). However, infections are carried out in infection buffer that do not contain any antibiotics (which may inhibit the bacterial growth). This also highlights the importance of washing the cell monolayers before starting the infections.</li><li>The 6-well plates are centrifuged after addition of bacteria to aid binding, as <em>Shigella</em> lacks adhesion factors.</li><li>Keep all the buffers and reagents that are required at initiation of invasion and thereafter, warmed up to 37 Â°C before using. The secretion of T3SS effectors mediating invasion is temperature dependent. It is active above 35 Â°C, but inactive at room temperature. In order to synchronize the invasion, it is important to keep the bacteria in buffers at room temperature before invasion.</li><li>The medium containing gentamicin should be prepared on the day of use.</li><li>Even during longer incubations, gentamicin wonât be able to penetrate the cells and kill the intracellular bacteria. The intracellular bacteria remain âprotectedâ all the times.</li><li>Deoxycholate is a detergent and therefore TC7 cell lysates should be made with little pipetting to avoid bubbles.</li><li>Use a dedicated incubator for infections.</li><li>When using the pipette controller, gently dispense the solutions with gravity (âGâ setting in Accurpipette) or at the lowest flow speed into the 6-well plate to avoid detaching the cell monolayer.</li><li>Be careful while swirling the plate, washing the cells and during centrifugation, because the confluent cell monolayer detaches easily.</li><li>The TC7 cells can survive for about 6 h in a medium devoid of serum. Therefore, additional serum is not required for infection times up to about 6 h. However, for longer incubation times, serum may be added after gentamicin treatment.</li><li>For further reading and details on basic methods that have not been detailed in this manuscript (like bacterial inoculation, pouring the plates, <em>etc</em>.) the reader is suggested to go through the following books: A Laboratory Manual (Cappuccino and Welsh, 2017) and Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique and Specialized Applications (Freshney, 2010).<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28338">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Congo red solution<br/>1% (w/v) Congo red in water<br/>Weigh 1 g of Congo red dye and dissolve it in 70 ml of water.
