            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model is one of the most commonly used animal models in ischemic stroke studies. In the model, increasing safety and efficacy of therapeutic agent administration, such as stem cells and drugs directly to the ischemic brain using the internal carotid artery (ICA) is essential, because using the common carotid artery (CCA) for injection can close CCA completely and cause many complications after tMCAO surgery. Also, the pterygopalatine artery (PPA) is an arterial branch of the ICA that supplies blood circulation of the external part of the brain and removing the blood circulation of the PPA is required for more complete induction of ischemia to the brain. Herein, we present the insertion of intra-arterial catheter in the ICA via the external carotid artery (ECA) after the PPA in rats subjected to tMCAO surgery.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Rat ischemic stroke models have been used substantially to evaluate the benefit of therapeutic agents and stem cells and to study the underlying mechanisms (Rousselet <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Azedi <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Since ischemic stroke in patients is mostly caused by the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), intraluminal suture middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) has become the most commonly used models in the investigation of stroke in rodents such as rat and mice (Longa <em>et al.</em>, 1989; Wang-Fischer, 2008; Tajiri <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Fluri <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/><br/>Method of intra-arterial delivery in stroke treatment is used in various studies and shows high safety and efficacy (Cloft <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Chua <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Crumrine <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Azedi <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In fact, Stem cells or drugs can be injected into the internal carotid artery (ICA) via common carotid artery (CCA) for targeted delivery into the reperfused brain tissue (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Misra <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Du <em>et al.</em>, 2014). However, after cutting the CCA for any interventions or injections, it has to be closed completely; or many complications for the animal, like increasing the mortality rate, can occur. Also, because the pterygopalatine artery (PPA) is a branch of the ICA, blood or any drug solutions will shunt into the PPA supplied region during any injection to the ICA and the efficacy of treatment may be reduced. Therefore, most researchers occluded the PPA when they performed intra-arterial injection (Guo <em>et al.</em>, 2013); however, because of deep location and poor access to this artery, ligation of the PPA is very hard and often causes complications (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2008). In this protocol, we describe a simple method for intra-arterial injection to the ICA via external carotid artery (ECA) to the ischemic brain without manipulating the PPA after tMCAO surgery. You can see a schematic view of this procedure in Figure 1.</p>

The catheter is 16.1 mm and inside of the ICA from the ECA stump is about 18-20 mm. It is not needed to insert whole of the catheter. The PPA is about 4-6 mm after the ECA stump. So, advance the catheter to the ICA about 8-10 mm (depend on the animal size). Be careful about the variations in some arteries among rats. Some rats have a different place of ECA-ICA bifurcation. So, the size of the inside of the ICA from ECA stump can be different.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191128/20191128000212_7968.jpg" width="179"/><br/><strong>Figure 9.

The animal usually regains consciousness in 15-20 min.<br/></li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30605">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz">After inducing ischemia by MCA occlusion, it is possible to determine the infarct size by MRI Scanning and if it is appropriate, you can start to insert the catheter in the ICA for drug delivery. (Figure 10).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191128/20191128000234_8940.jpg" width="126"/><br/><strong>Figure 10. The MRI scans of a rat subjected to MCAO.</strong> The infarct area around the territory of MCA on the left side of rat brain can be seen. The red circle indicates the infarct area.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30606">### Notes</p><p class="ppzz">During the surgery, avoid manipulating vagus nerve because overactivation of this nerve leads to cardiac arrest. Furthermore, contraction of bronchioles can cause respiratory problems after the surgery and increase mortality. The size of the microfilament and weight of rat are very important. If you use small microfilament, ischemia canât occur, and if you use big microfilament, subarachnoid hemorrhage can happen.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30607">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Ketamine/xylazine solution<br/>Ketamine (80 mg/kg)<br/>Xylazine (7 mg/kg)<br/>Mix them and prepare Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail for surgical anesthesia</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30608">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">The authors are thankful to Nahid Aboutaleb, Physiology Research Center and Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran and Yasin Asadi, Laboratory of Learning and Memory, Physiology Research Center and Physiology Department, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran for technical support, and Vice Chancellor of Research of Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, for financial support.
