            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Platelets regulate hemostasis and are the key determinants of pathogenic thrombosis following atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Platelets circulate in an inactive state, but become activated in response to damage to the endothelium, which exposes thrombogenic material such as collagen to the blood flow. Activation results in a number of responses, including secretion of soluble bioactive molecules via the release of alpha and dense granules, activation of membrane adhesion receptors, release of microparticles, and externalization of phosphatidylserine. These processes facilitate firm adhesion to sites of injury and the recruitment and activation of other platelets and leukocytes, resulting in aggregation and thrombus formation. Platelet activation drives the hemostatic response, and also contributes to pathogenic thrombus formation. Thus, quantification of platelet-associated responses is key to many pathophysiologically relevant processes. Here we describe protocols for isolating, counting, and activating platelets, and for the rapid quantification of cell surface proteins using flow cytometry.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Platelets are small circulating cells with key roles in the normal hemostatic response to vascular injury, and also in pathogenic thrombus formation resulting from, for example, atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Both hemostasis and plaque rupture result in exposure of thrombogenic material to the circulation, including collagen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and also a variety of soluble platelet agonists released from damaged cells. Thrombin, generated as part of the coagulation cascade, is a potent platelet agonist that activates platelets via protease-activated receptors. Once activated, platelets undergo a number of processes, including shape change, degranulation of alpha and dense granules, secretion of bioactive molecules (including platelet agonists, such as thromboxane A2, ADP and serotonin), phosphatidylserine exposure, and receptor activation. Released soluble platelet agonists regulate autocrine and paracrine activation via GPCR signaling, resulting in the activation and recruitment of other platelets, and formation of a thrombus (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2010).<br/><br/>Activation also results in upregulation of a number of adhesive receptors on the platelet surface. Principally, activation results in the âinside-outâ signaling processes that activate the fibrinogen receptor, integrin Î±<sub>IIb</sub>Î²<sub>3</sub> (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa), which is responsible for platelet-platelet interactions as a result of binding to fibrinogen. Activated Î±<sub>IIb</sub>Î²<sub>3</sub> also binds to vWF, further associating platelets to sites of vascular damage (Bennett, 1996). Activation also results in the externalization of P-selectin, which regulates leukocyte binding via its ligand P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1. This results in the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates, which are essential for the delivery of pro-inflammatory cytokines to the damaged endothelium (Yun <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Activation also causes loss of phospholipid asymmetry and exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer leaflet of the membrane. This supports the formation of the prothrombinase complex (Monroe <em>et al.</em>, 2002) and therefore the conversion of prothrombin into active thrombin (Lane <em>et al.</em>, 2005).<br/><br/>In addition to hemostatic roles, soluble factors released from activated platelets also influence other processes. For example, interleukin-1 from activated platelets has proinflammatory roles in arthritis (Boilard <em>et al.</em>, 2010), and cerebrovascular disease (Thornton <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Therefore, the importance of measuring factors found on the surface and released from activated platelets is important to many areas of biology. <br/><br/>Here we describe several commonly used protocols that can be used to isolate and activate platelets, and quantify the proteins they express. These protocols can be easily adapted to look at other proteins of interest on platelets. </p>
