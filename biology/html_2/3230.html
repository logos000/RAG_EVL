            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Many rhizobacteria isolated from plant rhizosphere produce various phytohormones in the form of secondary metabolites, the most common of which is Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Here, we detail analytical protocols of IAA detection and quantification,<em> in vitro</em> and <em>in situ,</em> as recently applied to <em>Klebsiella </em>SGM 81, a rhizobacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of <em>Dianthus caryophyllus </em>(a commercially important flower across the globe). Specifically, we describe a detailed protocol for a colorimetric assay using the Salkowski reagent method, which can be used to screen for the presence of Indole compounds. To further detect and quantify IAA, a highly accurate analytical approach of LC-MS/MS is used. To detect the presence of IAA around the root system of <em>Dianthus caryophyllus</em>, <em>in situ</em> staining of plant roots is done using Salkowski reagent.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The bacterial auxin in the form of Indole-3 Acetic Acid (IAA) is a product of L-tryptophan metabolized by bacteria (Lynch, 1985). The group of bacteria known as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) specifically residing in the vicinity of the roots depend on tryptophan being present in the root exudates of plants (Kravchenko <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Kamilova <em>et al.</em>, 2006). These PGPR use IAA as a signal to interact with plant roots and to colonize the plant parts. This signaling feature of IAA is thought to effect on the physiology of the bacteria (Spaepen <em>et al.</em>, 2007). <br/><br/>Different methods are found in the literature to detect the biosynthesis of IAA. Gordon and Weber (1951) were the first to provide a colorimetric assay using Salkowski reagent for the detection of IAA. This method has since been widely used for detecting IAA from microorganisms. Salkowski reagent is a mixture of 0.5 M ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3 </sub>) and 35% perchloric acid (HClO<sub>4</sub>) which upon reaction with IAA yields pink color, due to IAA complex formation with and reduction of Fe<sup>3+</sup> (Kamnev <em>et al.</em>, 2001). The color developed by positive reaction indicates the presence of various indole compounds as a product of tryptophan metabolism. Apart from the colorimetric assay, other methods for IAA estimation from bacteria and plant are High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (Perrig <em>et al.</em>, 2007), Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS/MS) (Chiwocha <em>et al.</em>, 2003), and by High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography HPTLC (Goswami <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Liquid Chromatography (LC) is the preferred approach to determine the concentration of IAA and to confirm its purity with high accuracy and standardization. LC coupled with various mass spectrometry detectors are powerful tools for IAA analysis. Because of the high sensitivity and selectivity, Mass Spectrometry detectors are most commonly coupled with LC. One of the important benefits of LC-MS is that analysis and separation of compounds can be achieved in a continuous manner eliminating the step of purification (Kallenbach <em>et al.</em>, 2009). </p>
