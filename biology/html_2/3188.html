            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) are pluripotent stem cells that can be generated from somatic cells, and provide a way to model the development of neural tissues <em>in vitro</em>. One particularly interesting application of iPSCs is the development of neurons analogous to those found in the human forebrain. Forebrain neurons play a central role in cognition and sensory processing, and deficits in forebrain neuronal activity contributes to a host of conditions, including epilepsy, Alzheimerâs disease, and schizophrenia. Here, we present our protocol for differentiating iPSCs into forebrain neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons, whereby neural rosettes are generated from stem cells without dissociation and NPCs purified from rosettes based on their adhesion, resulting in a more rapid generation of pure NPC cultures. Neural progenitor cells can be maintained as long-term cultures, or differentiated into forebrain neurons. This protocol provides a simplified and fast methodology of generating forebrain NPCs and neurons, and enables researchers to generate effective <em>in vitro</em> models to study forebrain disease and neurodevelopment. This protocol can also be easily adapted to generate other neural lineages.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are stem cells produced from non-pluripotent source cells and tissues (Shi <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Due to their ability to differentiate into a wide range of cell types, they are a promising avenue for improving our understanding of human development and treatment of degenerative diseases (Marchetto <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Of particular interest are iPSC-derived models of human forebrain neurons, as these cells are known to mediate higher order brain functions, including consciousness (Baxter and Chiba, 1999), emotion (Morgane <em>et al.</em>, 2005), and sleep (Schwartz and Roth, 2008). As a result, deficits in these cells can cause a wide range of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimerâs (Auld <em>et al.</em>, 2002) and Huntingtonâs (McColgan and Tabrizi, 2018), as well as neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism (Donovan and Basson, 2017) and epilepsy (Heath, 1976). As there are few effective forebrain models for humans, the discovery of iPSCs spurred a rapid push to develop effective protocols to differentiate iPSCs to forebrain neurons (Srikanth and Young-Pearse, 2014). The first protocols that were developed drew upon previous work using embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which relied upon feeder cell cultures. This complicated the procedure and raised concerns about clinical applications. Later protocols were able to generate forebrain neurons without using feeder cells (Bell <em>et al.</em>, 2017), with some eliminating all animal generated products entirely (Yuan <em>et al.</em>, 2015). It can be difficult to make an all-encompassing statement about the protocols currently used to generate forebrain NPCs, due to the multitude of labs currently generating forebrain neurons and the many variables that can be changed and optimized. However, many of the recently most cited published protocols for the generation of forebrain NPCs and neurons can be divided into two kinds, monolayer and embryoid bodies (EBs) protocols. In an EB based protocol, iPSCs are dissociated and plated in suspension in a neural induction media to allow them to form EBs, which gradually aggregate over 5-7 days (Pasca <em>et al.</em>, 2011). These EBs are then transferred to a plate that supports cell attachment, enabling the embryoid bodies to attach to the bottom of the plate and spread out into a neural rosette. From this rosette, neural stem cells (NSCs) arise, which can be passaged to form relatively stable neural progenitors cells (NPCs) (Shi <em>et al.</em>, 2012). NPCs can then be plated in a neuronal induction media to give rise to mature neurons (Bell <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Monolayer based protocols chiefly differ in that iPSC colonies are maintained as a monolayer during neural induction, and develop directly into rosettes without aggregation (Chandrasekaran <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Using either approach, generation of NPCs from iPSCs is typically reported to require 21-30 days, with electrically active neurons requiring an additional 30+ days of differentiation from NPCs, for a total time of 50+ days to generate forebrain neurons from iPSCs (Yuan <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/> <br/>This protocol describes a methodology for generating forebrain neurons from iPSCs, where iPSC colonies are induced to form neural rosettes without mechanical dissociation, and neural progenitor cells are purified from immature clusters of neural cells, known as neural rosettes based on differential adhesion. Neural progenitor cells will not attach to non-adherent plates and aggregate together in a floating mass, while other cells types either adhere or float but do not aggregate with NPCs (Bell <em>et al.</em>, 2017). This allows rapid purification of NPCs, has the potential for automation and enables the generation of NPC cultures within 14 days of initiation of differentiation. This modification does not appear to negatively influence the fate of the cells, as we observe uniform staining for key neural progenitor cells markers (Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Venere <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Zhang and Jiao, 2015). Indeed, we have found that we are capable of recording electrical activity from neurons consistently in as little as five days of differentiation from NPCs. This protocol can be used to generate forebrain neurons simply and effectively for use in investigating neurodevelopment, the etiology of diseases that affect the forebrain, and drug testing.<br/></p>

tissue culture dish that is coated with Matrigel</em><sup><em>Â®</em></sup><em> (for more details, see Recipes and Table 2).</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy"

Sample ICC staining for high-quality iPSC cultures.</strong> In order for differentiation to proceed effectively, ensure that you begin differentiation with high-quality iPSC cultures. IPSCs should uniformly express pluripotency markers SSEA, OCT4, TRA-1-60, and NANOG (A) when assessed using ICC. Additional pluripotency markers DNMT3b, EST2, and ZFP42 can also be assessed using a qPCR assay (B). IPSCs should be free of karyotypic abnormalities (C), possess the ability to differentiate into all three germ lineages and express characteristic markers of each lineage (D), and test negative for mycoplasma contamination (E). Scale bars represent 100 Î¼m.<br/><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Working in a class II biological safety cabinet, use appropriately sized pipettes to plate iPSCs in E8 medium in a 60-mm dish. If starting from a frozen aliquot of iPSC, we recommend plating at least 300,000 cells. This is considered Day 0 of iPSC culture.</li><li>On Day 1 of iPSC culture (15%-25% confluency), aspirate the spent medium to remove non-attached cells, and check the size of colonies. If colonies are approximately 100-200 Âµm in diameter, they are an appropriate size to begin differentiation. Add 3 ml of complete Neural Induction Medium 1, pre-warmed in a bead bath to each plate using a 5 ml pipette. Return the plates to an incubator maintained at 37 Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and atmospheric (~20%) Oxygen. If plates do not contain colonies of sufficient size, add 3 ml of E8 media and check daily until colonies reach the appropriate size.</li><li>On Day 2 (about 48 h after switching to Neural Induction Medium), change the medium by aspirating old medium from each well. Add 3 ml of pre-warmed complete Neural Induction Medium 1 to each plate.</li><li>On Day 4 of neural induction, cells will be reaching confluency. <strong>If necessary</strong>, mark any colonies with non-neural differentiation. Remove these unwanted colonies with a 200 Âµl pipette tip. Aspirate the spent medium from each well. Add 3 ml of pre-warmed complete Neural Induction Medium 1 to each plate.<br/><em>Note: Due to high cell density in the culture from Day 4 onwards, doubling the volume of Neural Induction Medium is very critical for cell nutrition. Also, minimal cell death should be observed from Days 4 to 7 after neural induction. If the color of cells turns yellowish with many floating cells during Days 4 to 7 of neural induction, it indicates that the starting density of iPSCs was too high. In this case, change the Neural Induction Medium every day, remove some colonies and double the volume per well/plate. Ideally, work with these variables to ensure that the media does not continue to turn yellow.</em> </li><li>On Day 6 of neural induction, cells should be near maximal confluence. Remove any non-neural differentiated cells that can be observed and add 3 ml of complete Neural Induction Medium into each plate.</li><li>On Day 7 of neural induction, the medium should be switched into Neural Induction Medium 2. Add 3 ml of complete Neural Induction Medium 2 to each plate. The medium should be changed every day for 5 days.
