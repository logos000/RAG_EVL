            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Intercellular communication plays a crucial role in the establishment of multicellular organisms by organizing and coordinating growth, development and defence responses. In plants, cell-to-cell communication takes place through nanometric membrane channels called plasmodesmata (PD). Understanding how PD dictate cellular connectivity greatly depends on a comprehensive knowledge of the molecular composition and the functional characterization of PD components. While proteomic and genetic approaches have been crucial to identify PD-associated proteins, <em>in vivo</em> fluorescence microscopy combined with fluorescent protein tagging is equally crucial to visualise the subcellular localisation of a protein of interest and gain knowledge about their dynamic behaviour. In this protocol we describe in detail a robust method for quantifying the degree of association of a given protein with PD, through ratiometric fluorescent intensity using confocal microscopy. Although developed for <em>N. benthamiana</em> and <em>Arabidopsis</em>, this protocol can be adapted to other plant species.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Currently, confirmation of protein localization to PD by confocal imaging is based primarily on two different approaches. On the one hand, the molecular composition of the cell wall surrounding PD differs. While the cell wall is highly enriched in cellulose, the environment near the PD is enriched in callose, a beta (1-3) glucan polymer that can easily and specifically be stained with fluorophore Aniline Blue. This staining presents the considerable advantage of being used as a PD marker without crossed lines. On the other hand, proteomic studies have identified specific PD proteins and led to their characterization (Faulkner <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Fernandez-Calvino <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Grison <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Brault <em>et al.</em>, 2019). These proteins can be used as PD markers in subsequent studies when tagged with fluorescent proteins in transient or stable expression in plants (Thomas <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Simpson <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Note that PD proteins can be exclusively associated with PD but can also present a dual localization within different cellular compartments as for Synaptotagmin1 (SYT1), Multiple C2 domains and Transmembrane regions Protein 4 (MCTP4) which associate with both the Endoplasmic Reticulum and PD (Levy <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Brault <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Since PD are dynamic structures responding to developmental and environmental cues, their molecular constituents may vary conditionally (Benitez-Alfonso <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Stahl <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Han <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Sager and Lee, 2014; Otero <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Stahl and Faulkner, 2016). Thus, Receptor Like Kinases (RLKs), such as the Leucine-Rich-Repeat RLKs Qian Shou Kinase 1 (QSK1) and Inflorescence Meristem Kinase 2 (IMK2) or the Cystein-Rich Receptor Kinase 2 (CRK2), are able to dynamically relocate to PD upon osmotic stress conditions (Grison <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Hunter <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The study of the dynamic localization of protein <em>in vivo</em> requires the development of quantification methodologies. Using confocal microscopy, we developed a ratiometric calculations to evaluate the PD enrichment of a given protein using PD markers, hereinafter referred as âPD Indexâ. The PD Index can be used for co-localization experiments but also as reference points for characterizing mutants, drugs or growing conditions that could modify the degree of proteins PD association (Perraki <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Brault <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Grison <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</p>

Direct observation should be done with a low power of the mercury lamp to avoid the bleaching of the sample. In confocal mode, please use a 405 nm laser power as low as possible for the same reason. With the ZEISS 880 confocal device, the laser power is generally set around 0.2 to 5%, but of course this may vary depending on the microscope used. Aniline blue staining can be visualised immediately and is stable during 10 to 15 min.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200303/20200303000601_9270.jpg" width="572"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

Between experiments and in a same experiment the setting parameters of the PD marker can be modified to obtain the better signal as possible without bleaching. In a same experiment the fluorescent tagged protein of interest channel setting must be kept identical while comparing different mutants or conditions. Between experiments we also recommend keeping the same settings for the fluorescently-tagged protein of interest.

It is important to control that the excitation wavelength used for one fluorescent protein does not excite the other one,<em> i.e.</em>, ensure there is no crosstalk between the PD marker/Aniline blue and the tag of the protein of interest (Table 1).<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>The Aniline Blue stock solution is 1 mg/ml in water.

QSK1 and IMK2, two PM associated LRR-RLKs which conditionally relocalize to PD, display a PD Index rising from 0.9 to 1 in control condition to 1.5 to 2 upon abiotic stress (Grison </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2019). It is also important to note that the system of expression may sorely influence the PD Index value. Illustrating this, At-MCTP4 display a PD Index of 1.85 when transiently expressed in N. benthamiana, whereas the PD Index raised to 5 when stably expressed in Arabidopsis (Brault </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2019).</em><br/>  For statistical analysis the use of R software and the Rcmdr package is recommended. Parametrical tests can be use only when n â¥ 20 and when the sample distribution respect the normal law. Non-parametrical tests are systematically used when n &lt; 20.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32054">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">J.D.P. is funded by a PhD fellowship from the Belgian âFormation Ã  la Recherche dans l'Industrie et l'Agricultureâ (FRIA grant no. 1.E.096.18).<br/>  This work was supported by the National Agency for Research (Grant ANR-14-CE19-0006-01 to E.M.B), âOsez lâinterdisciplinaritÃ©â OSEZ-2017-BBRIDGING CNRS program to E.M.B., the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionâs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 772103-BRIDGING to E.M.B).</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32055">### Competing interests</p><p class="ppzz">The authors declare no competing financial interests.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32056">### References</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Benitez-Alfonso, Y., Faulkner, C., Pendle, A., Miyashima, S., Helariutta, Y. and Maule, A.
