            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Dissolved oxygen and its availability to cells in culture is an overlooked variable which can have significant consequences on experimental research outcomes, including reproducibility. Oxygen sensing pathways play key roles in cell growth and behavior and pericellular oxygen levels should be controlled when establishing <em>in vitro</em> models. Standard cell culture techniques do not have adequate control over pericellular oxygen levels. Slow diffusion through culture media limits the precision of oxygen delivery to cells, making it difficult to accurately reproduce <em>in vivo</em>-like oxygen conditions. Furthermore, different types of cells consume oxygen at varying rates and this can be affected by the density of growing cells. Here, we describe a novel <em>in vitro</em> system that utilizes hypoxic chambers and oxygen-permeable culture dishes to control pericellular oxygen levels and provide rapid oxygen delivery to adherent cells. This procedure is particularly relevant for protocols studying effects of rapid oxygen changes or intermittent hypoxia on cellular behavior. The system is inexpensive and easily assembled without highly specialized equipment.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Oxygen availability can impact on many signaling pathways and small changes to the level of pericellular oxygen can alter growth rate, metabolism, free radical production, and general cell behavior (Place <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Bordt, 2018). Therefore, to preserve normal cellular function, oxygen levels need to be maintained within a relatively narrow ânormoxicâ range. This applies both to cells <em>in vivo</em> and to cell lines used in cell culture (Hunyor and Cook, 2018).<br/><br/>In most cell culture models, experimental ânormoxicâ values are based on the oxygen levels supplied in cell culture incubators. In dry air at sea level, atmospheric oxygen is ~20.9% v/v (Hunyor and Cook, 2018). In standard humidified cell culture incubators maintained at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, oxygen levels are equal to 18.6% O<sub>2</sub> (v/v), equivalent to an oxygen tension or oxygen partial pressure (pO<sub>2</sub>) of 138 mmHg (Wenger <em>et al.</em>, 2015). However, cells are maintained at much lower pO<sub>2</sub> levels <em>in vivo</em> (Carreau <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Under normal ventilatory conditions, pO<sub>2</sub> in the arterial blood ranges from 80-100 mmHg (10.8-13.5% O<sub>2</sub> v/v) and this is further lowered as oxygen molecules diffuse through tissue and are consumed by cells (Carreau <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Moreover, different tissues have unique ranges of physiological normoxia, depending on the specific oxygen demands of individual tissues. Using a single oxygen concentration to represent physiological normoxia for a range of cell types is not representative of the <em>in vivo</em> environment (Carreau <em>et al.</em>, 2011). When studying pathological oxygen conditions (such as in ischemia or in tumor hypoxia) cells should be exposed to oxygen tensions that appropriately model the specific pathological state of the tissue. In brain ischemia, pO<sub>2</sub> levels can decrease below 10 mmHg (1% v/v) (Hoffman <em>et al.</em>, 1999). In tumors, pO<sub>2</sub> levels can range from 15 mmHg (2.1% v/v) to as low as 2 mmHg (0.3% v/v) and this can also depend on the tissue of origin (Byrne <em>et al.</em>, 2014). <br/><br/>The concentration of oxygen used to represent hypoxia is important because oxygen-sensing proteins have optimal pO<sub>2</sub> ranges for which they operate. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor activated by low oxygen. HIF is thought to control the expression of up to 1,000 genes and it has important roles in health and disease including embryogenesis (Dunwoodie, 2009), angiogenesis (Cook and Figg, 2010), cancer (Cook <em>et al.</em>, 2009), diabetes (Thangarajah <em>et al.</em>, 2010), inflammation and immune function (Palazon <em>et al.</em>, 2014). HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î± have been found to be stabilized under different oxygen tensions (Holmquist-Mengelbier <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Lin <em>et al.</em>, 2011). In neuroblastoma, HIF-2Î± is stabilized in 5% O<sub>2</sub> and can be strongly expressed even in well-vascularized areas, while HIF-1Î± is stabilized below 1% O<sub>2</sub> in extremely hypoxic regions of the tumor (Holmquist-Mengelbier <em>et al.</em>, 2006). A small change in oxygen levels can therefore alter the balance of HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î±, which affects what genes are expressed and ultimately how the cells behave. As we build better <em>in vitro</em> systems to accurately model <em>in vivo</em> conditions, oxygen levels are a key experimental variable to consider.<br/><br/>A common method used to modulate oxygen conditions in cell culture involves the use of a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator with variable oxygen control (Wu and Yotnda, 2011). The major drawback of this method when using traditional cell culture techniques is that long exposure periods are required for the oxygen present in the gas phase to diffuse to cells attached at the bottom of the culture dish. Depending on the volume and depth of media, this can take hours due to poor oxygen diffusivity in aqueous media (Allen <em>et al.</em>, 2001). Oxygen conditions at the pericellular level therefore do not immediately match the oxygen conditions supplied in the incubator air. One method to counteract this is to pre-equilibrate media/reagents to the desired pO<sub>2</sub> levels prior to culturing. The major issue with this is that unless the cell culture is handled within a closed compartment (such as in an airtight glove box), oxygen from the ambient air is constantly diffusing into media and reagents, preventing the precise control over the oxygen concentrations being delivered to cells (Byrne <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Many laboratories are not readily equipped with oxygen-controlled incubators or glove boxes due to their high costs.<br/><br/>As a more cost-effective alternative, we have designed a cell culture system that utilizes commercially available oxygen-permeable cultureware. The culture dishes are composed of a thin membrane surface that is highly permeable to oxygen. Cells adhere to the membrane and are covered in media as with normal cell culture methods. However, due to the extremely high oxygen permeability of the membranes, cells have access to oxygen almost instantly from ambient air through the membrane rather than through the media (Figure 1). This enables faster oxygen equilibration rates to be achieved at the cellular level. These fast rates of oxygen cycling therefore make this model particularly useful for protocols aimed at studying rapid changes in oxygenation or intermittent hypoxia, relevant to diseases such as cancer (Michiels <em>et al.</em>, 2016), obstructive sleep apnea (Minoves <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Martinez <em>et al.</em>, 2019), cardiovascular disease and ischemia (Savla <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p>

In our experience, all cell lines successfully attached onto oxygen-permeable membrane without need for an extracellular matrix protein coating.

To construct a simple customized hypoxic chamber, we purchased various sizes of preassembled Clear Acrylic Round Cylinder Display Risers (Plymor, available through Amazon, USA). The dimensions of this cylinder-shaped hypoxic chamber are: 7 cm in diameter (internal) and 3.5 cm in height, with a total volume of 140 cm<sup>3</sup> (Figure 3B). Flat pieces of acrylic (1 cm thick) can also be purchased from Plymor for use as the lid. The acrylic can be cut to a diameter slightly bigger than the diameter of the chamber. The lid of the chamber used in this protocol has a diameter of 8 cm (Figure 3A).<br/>   To ensure a tight seal, a groove can be sculpted into the underside of the lid so that it fits snugly onto the cylinder (see Figure 3C). Alternatively, the addition of ~200 Âµl-500 Âµl of silicone grease on the rim of the hypoxic chamber at the start of the experiment should be enough to hold the lid in place to ensure an airtight fit. A weight can be added on top of the lid to ensure the lid stays in place (Figure 4D).<br/>  The hypoxic chamber should have inlet and outlet holes for flowing gases (Figure 3 and 4), which can be drilled in the lid. Tubing adaptors (see Figures 4A and 4B) can be purchased from the local hardware store and placed in the holes drilled in the lid (~1 cm in diameter). The adaptors can be secured in place using epoxy or silicone glue.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917200840_2134.jpg" width="150"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.

There have been studies that have measured oxygenation in various tissues <em>in vivo</em> using an oxygen sensor (see Table 1 in [Hunyor and Cook, 2018]). Estimations can therefore be made based on these measurements. Alternatively, a good starting point is to use an oxygen concentration that represents oxygenation of cells located close to major blood vessels (~90 mmHg or 12% v/v).</li><li>Defining hypoxia<br/>Hypoxic concentrations should be set according to the type of disease being modeled. In tumors, oxygen values can range from 2 to 15 mmHg, depending on the size, location and tissue type. 4 mmHg is a good starting point to reflect severe hypoxia in tumors.</li><li>Defining intermittent hypoxia<br/>Protocols of intermittent hypoxia will also depend on the type of disease being modeled. This procedure has been used in a previous study that modeled obstructive sleep apnea in tumors (Martinez <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Oxygen concentrations for intermittent hypoxia were based on measurements taken in a mouse tumor (subcutaneous melanoma) model of obstructive sleep apnea. Oxygen fluctuations in the tumor alternated between ~5 mmHg (0.6% v/v) to ~50 mmHg (7% v/v) (Almendros <em>et al.</em>, 2013), so protocols of oxygen cycling were modified to produce fluctuations between 5 and 50 mmHg in the pericellular media (Martinez <em>et al.</em>, 2019) (see Figure 6G).<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Expose cells to the desired mixed gases<ol class="npwtwo"><li>For exposures to one oxygen condition (<em>i.e.</em>, continuous normoxia or continuous hypoxia), the inlet of the chamber can be connected to a gas canister pre-mixed to the desired gas composition (If this step was used, skip to Procedure G).</li><li>Alternatively, the inlet of the chamber can be connected to a gas blender connected to N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> gas sources.
