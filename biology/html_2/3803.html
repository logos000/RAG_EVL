            <h1><em>Candida albicans</em> Culture, Cell Harvesting, and Total RNA Extraction</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Max V. Cravener, Aaron P. Mitchell</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Transcriptional analysis has become a cornerstone of biological research, and with the advent of cheaper and more efficient sequencing technology over the last decade, there exists a need for high-yield and efficient RNA extraction techniques. Fungi such as the human pathogen <em>Candida albicans</em> present a unique obstacle to RNA purification in the form of the tough cell wall made up of many different components such as chitin that are resistant to many common mammalian or bacterial cell lysis methods. Typical <em>in vitro C. albicans</em> cell harvesting methods can be time consuming and expensive if many samples are being processed with multiple opportunities for product loss or sample variation. Harvesting cells via vacuum filtration rather than centrifugation cuts down on time before the cells are frozen and therefore the available time for the RNA expression profile to change. Vacuum filtration is preferred for <em>C. albicans</em> for two main reasons: cell lysis is faster on non-pelleted cells due to increased exposed surface area, and filamentous cells are difficult to pellet in the first place unlike yeast or bacterial cells. Using mechanical cell lysis, by way of zirconia/silica beads, cuts down on time for processing as well as overall cost compared to enzymatic treatments. Overall, this method is a fast, efficient, and high-yield way to extract total RNA from <em>in vitro</em> cultures of <em>C. albicans</em>.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>The need for fast, reproducible, and efficient RNA extraction techniques has grown significantly over the last several years due to the steady increase in use of RNA sequencing and other expression analysis techniques that have become more affordable and faster with improvements in sequencing technology. There are many different kits and protocols out there from various companies and labs that attempt to meet this need. However, methods that are built specifically for one type of fungi may not be usable for another, and kit platforms can often fall short by way of being too broad in their application. Here we describe a cell culture, harvest, and RNA extraction method for the pathogenic fungus, <em>Candida albicans</em>, that utilizes a combination of techniques to give both high yield and high-quality RNA in a consistent and efficient manner.</p><br/><p> One of the main attributes unique to this approach is the harvest of cells via vacuum filtration rather than by centrifugation. Centrifugation of a 25 ml culture of filamentous cells, as is used in this protocol, must be done over a period of 5 min in order to pellet the cells enough to aspirate the growth media. This additional time before freezing the cells and halting cellular processes opens the door for unwanted transcriptional changes. Previous studies have shown that yeast cells can alter their expression profiles well within the 5 min that is needed to spin cells down (Dikicioglu <em>et al.</em>, 2011). It is then of critical importance to shorten the time between the incubation/growth period and when the cells are frozen, and vacuum filtration serves this purpose well. It can take anywhere from 5-10 min between incubation and freezing when using centrifugation, but that time decreases to 1-2 min using vacuum filtration with the most time-consuming step being transporting the samples from the bench to the freezer. Not only does this saved time cut down on transcriptional variation, but it also allows for more samples to be processed in the same amount of time increasing overall throughput for this method.</p><br/><p> The second variation in this this approach that differs from other methods is the use of zirconia/silica beads in combination with a lysis buffer for cell disruption as opposed to enzymatic or lysis buffer only methods. Mechanical cell disruption via bead beating has been shown to significantly increase RNA yields in <em>C. albicans</em>, compared to vertical vortexing without beads in lysis buffer alone (Rodríguez and Vaneechoutte, 2019). Zirconia/silica beads have a higher density than the typical glass beads used in bacterial (3.7 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and 2.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup> respectively) which increases their efficiency at rupturing the tough fungal cell walls. An additional benefit of mechanical cell disruption is that enzymatic methods such as zymolyase digestion have been shown previously to alter RNA expression profiles of the sample being assayed by activating stress response pathways thereby confounding the downstream analysis (Suzuki and Iwahashi, 2013).</p><br/><p> Overall, by utilizing mechanical cell disruption and vacuum filtration combined with the commercially available Qiagen RNEasy MiniKit, this technique represents a fast, and efficient method for cell harvesting and RNA extraction saving time and giving more consistent and reliable transcriptional data.</p><br/></p>

It can also be adapted for whatever media conditions outside of RPMI + 10% FBS. However, with the addition of more replicates and strains it is recommended that a single large batch of media is made, if possible, ahead of time to eliminate batch effects on the transcriptional profile of the strains. For example, here we call for 200 ml of RPMI + 10% FBS for 6 samples which allows for 50ml extra. If 60 samples were needed instead, 1.5 L of RPMI + 10% FBS should be made up in one large batch then aliquoted into smaller units for use over several days.</p></li><li><p>This protocol does not include a DNase treatment. This means that the final product may have some DNA contamination. The Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit spin columns prevent most DNA carry-over by design, but residual DNA may remain. If DNA contamination must be avoided for downstream applications, DNase treatment may be done on the spin column between Steps B12 and B13 or after final elution, and a protocol for this can be found in the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit protocol.</p></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti38579">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>YPD liquid growth media</p><ol class="npwthree"><li><p>Dissolve 20 g dextrose, 20 g peptone, and 10 g yeast extract with 500 ml dH<sub>2</sub>O</p></li><li><p>Bring volume to 1 L with dH<sub>2</sub>O</p></li><li><p>Autoclave to sterilize</p></li></ol></li><li><p>10 N NaOH</p><ol class="npwthree"><li><p>Dissolve 40 g NaOH in 50 ml dH<sub>2</sub>O</p></li><li><p>Bring volume up to 100 ml with dH<sub>2</sub>O</p></li></ol></li><li><p>RPMI+10% FBS</p><ol class="npwthree"><li><p>Dissolve 3.28 g RPMI1640 powder in 180 ml dH<sub>2</sub>O</p></li><li><p>Adjust pH to 7.4 using 10 N NaOH (approximately 180 Âµl)</p></li><li><p>Sterilize RPMI solution by vacuum filtration</p></li><li><p>Thaw Fetal Bovine Serum Premium (FBS) in 37 Â°C water bath</p><p><em>Note: The FBS manufacturer recommends avoiding repeated freeze thaw cycles, so plan accordingly.</em> </p></li><li><p>Shake gently to resuspend any solids</p></li><li><p>Add 20 ml thawed FBS to 200 ml RPMI solution and mix with gentle shaking to avoid foaming</p></li><li><p>Store at 4 Â°C for up to a month</p></li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti38580">### Acknowledgments</p><p>Work on <em>C. albicans</em> RNA in this lab is supported by NIH grants 1R21AI144878-01 and 1R01AI146103 (PI: Mitchell).
