            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The brown alga <em>Ectocarpus</em> has a haploid-diploid life cycle that involves alternation between two multicellular generations, the sporophyte and the gametophyte. Life cycle generation is not determined by ploidy but by a genetic system that includes two different three amino acid loop extension homeodomain transcription factors called OUROBOROS and SAMSARA. In addition, sporophytes have been shown to secrete a diffusible factor into the medium that can induce gametophyte initial cells to switch from the gametophyte to the sporophyte developmental program. The protocol presented here describes how to produce sporophyte-conditioned medium containing the diffusible sporophyte-inducing factor and how to assay for activity of the factor using a meio-spore-based bioassay. The protocol, which describes how several steps of these procedures can be optimised, will represent a useful tool for future work aimed at characterising the diffusible factor and investigating its mode of action.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><em>Ectocarpus</em> is a small, filamentous brown alga that has been adopted as a genetic model organism for this group of seaweeds (Peters <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Coelho <em>et al.</em>, 2012a). The brown algae exhibit a broad range of different life cycles (Cock <em>et al.</em>, 2014). <em>Ectocarpus</em> has a haploid-diploid life cycle (Figure 1) that involves alternation between two multicellular generations, the gametophyte and the sporophyte (MÃ¼ller, 1967; Bothwell <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Transition from the sporophyte to the gametophyte generation involves the production of meio-spores, which are released into the surrounding environment and germinate to produce separate male and female, haploid gametophytes. To complete the life cycle, mature female and male gametophytes produce gametes, which fuse to produce a zygote, the initial cell of the diploid sporophyte generation. Life cycle generation (<em>i.e.</em>, sporophyte or gametophyte identity) is not determined by ploidy because single gametes are able to develop parthenogenetically, without fusing to produce a zygote, leading to the production of haploid partheno-sporophytes that are phenotypically indistinguishable from diploid sporophytes derived from a zygote (MÃ¼ller, 1967; Bothwell <em>et al.</em>, 2010). The gametophyte and sporophyte generations of <em>Ectocarpus</em> are free-living, exhibit distinct morphologies and functions and show spatio-temporal independence, facilitating the study of the developmental program of each generation and their relationship with the life cycle.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200917/20200917020415_4364.jpg" width="214"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. The <em>Ectocarpus</em> life cycle.</strong> The diploid sporophyte produces meio-spores via a single meiotic cell division (R! for reduction) followed by multiple mitotic divisions in each unilocular sporangium (US). The meio-spores are released and develop as gametophytes. Gametophytes are either male or female (dioicy) and produce either male or female gametes in plurilocular gametangia (PG). Pairs of male and female gametes fuse (F! for fusion) to form zygotes, which develop as diploid sporophytes to complete the sexual cycle (left). Unfused gametes can undergo parthenogenesis to produce partheno-sporophytes. Partheno-sporophytes produce spores in unilocular sporangia, which develop as gametophytes to complete the parthenogenetic cycle (right). In addition, both diploid sporophytes and partheno-sporophytes produce mito-spores in plurilocular sporangia (PS), which germinate to produce a new sporophyte generation with the same ploidy as its parent (dotted line). Treatment with sporophyte-conditioned medium (+ SCM) induces a subset of meio-spores to switch from the gametophyte to the sporophyte developmental program (grey text). Adapted from Peters <em>et al.</em> (2008).<br/> <br/>Alternation of generations in <em>Ectocarpus</em> has been shown to be controlled by two homeodomain transcription factors (HD TFs) of the three amino acid loop extension (TALE) class, OUROBOROS (ORO) and SAMSARA (SAM), which are necessary for the initiation of the sporophyte program (Coelho <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Arun <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In addition, the sporophyte has been shown to secrete a non-cell-autonomous, diffusible factor that can cause receptive cells to switch from the gametophyte to the sporophyte developmental program (Arun <em>et al.</em>, 2013 and 2019). This diffusible sporophyte-inducing factor is only effective on the single-cell stage of the gametophyte generation. Developing meio-spores became resistant to the factor at the same point in time as they synthesise a cell wall, about 24-48 h after release from unilocular sporangia (Arun <em>et al.</em>, 2013). This observation suggests that the cell wall may play a role in locking the individual into the developmental program that has been initiated. <em>oro</em> and <em>sam</em> mutants do not respond to treatment with the diffusible factor, suggesting that ORO and SAM are part of the signalling network that detects the factor.<br/> <br/>Preparations of the diffusible sporophyte-inducing factor are produced by filtering seawater medium in which <em>Ectocarpus</em> sporophytes have been cultivated, resulting in cell-free, sporophyte-conditioned medium (SCM). Procedures to produce and assay the diffusible factor were described briefly in Arun <em>et al.</em> (2013) and Arun <em>et al.</em> (2019). Activity of the diffusible factor can be assayed either by treating freshly released meio-spores or by treating gametophyte-derived protoplasts (Arun <em>et al.</em>, 2013). The protocol below describes treatment of meio-spores, which are easier to obtain than gametophyte-derived protoplasts. For information about the method using gametophyte-derived protoplasts, please refer to Arun <em>et al.</em> (2013). The meio-spore-based procedure is described in detail and some specific tips to improve both SCM production and the bioassay for the diffusible factor are provided. This detailed protocol is currently being employed in experiments aimed at biochemically characterising the diffusible factor.</p>

Depending on the strain of <em>Ectocarpus</em>, meio-spores can exhibit different levels of heteroblasty, <em>i.e.</em>, spontaneous initiation of the sporophyte program instead of the gametophyte program (MÃ¼ller, 1967). To assay the activity of the diffusible factor, it is important to use a strain that exhibits a low level of spontaneous heteroblasty, such as the strain Ec32.</li><li>Induce the release of gametes from 45 to 60 mature gametophytes by grouping the material together in a small volume of PES (to simulate low tide conditions) and incubating in the dark at 13 Â°C for four hours (follow the procedure described in Steps A2a-A2c above).</li><li>Allow the gametes to germinate parthenogenetically to produce partheno-sporophytes under standard growth conditions: light intensity of 20 ÂµM photons/m<sup>2</sup>/s, 12 h:12 h light:dark at 13 Â°C in 150-mm Petri dishes (Coelho <em>et al.</em>, 2012b).</li><li>Change the culture medium regularly (once every 2 weeks) until the partheno-sporophyte filaments produce upright filaments. When upright filaments are produced, remove individual partheno-sporophytes and culture separately. Note that cultures grown at high density will not produce unilocular sporangia. Plurilocular sporangia should develop after about 1 to 2 weeks and the unilocular sporangia appear about one week later.</li><li>Alternatively, unilocular sporangia can be produced on cultured upright filaments, for example by transferring previously dissected upright filaments with unilocular sporangia that have released meio-spores back into culture. These filaments will adhere to the bottom of a 55-mm Petri dish and produce new upright filaments in a few days under standard culture conditions. The upright filaments will produce many unilocular sporangia after about one week. Cultivation of upright filaments results in the production of fewer (or no) plurilocular sporangia than cultivation of partheno-sporophytes (reducing the risk of contaminating meio-spore preparations with mito-spores). This method of producing unilocular sporangia is more rapid than cultivation of whole partheno-sporophytes.</li></ol></li><li>Bioassay of the diffusible factor by treatment of meio-spores<ol class="npwthree"><li>Under a binocular microscope, dissect a piece of sporophyte upright filament that bears one or more unilocular sporangia using a sterile glass Pasteur pipette that has been broken to create a sharp, cutting point (Figure 3).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200917/20200917020602_7207.jpg" width="187"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.

The coverslip should be fixed to the bottom of the Petri dish by placing it on a drop of 10 Âµl of PES. Place three drops of PES around the edge of the Petri dish to keep the chamber moist and seal the Petri dish with parafilm. Note that the SCM can be replaced by any other seawater-based sample that you would like to test for diffusible factor activity.</li><li>In parallel, transfer unilocular sporangia to drops of PES, using the same set-up, as negative controls (<em>i.e.</em>, incubation in seawater that does not contain any active factors).</li><li>Place the unilocular sporangia in strong light conditions (30 ÂµM photons/m<sup>2</sup>/s) overnight to induce release of the meio-spores (100-200 meio-spores per unilocular sporangium) directly into the 300 Âµl drop of test or control solution. Release of the meio-spores from the unilocular sporangia should take less than 48 h. Discard any plates in which release has not occurred within this time frame.</li><li>After meio-spore release, remove the piece of upright filament with forceps.</li><li>After 72 h, gently add 10 ml of PES to the Petri dish. The meio-spore-derived germlings will be weakly attached to the coverslip at this stage and the added medium assures that they grow under optimal conditions.</li><li>After an additional three or four days examine the Petri dish under an inverted microscope to score the numbers of gametophyte and sporophyte individuals (Figure 4). Sporophytes can be distinguished from gametophytes based on a symmetrical pattern of initial cell division and the presence of thick walled round cells rather than wavy rhizoid cells. Note that, if meio-spores are released within 48 h but then germinate slowly, the germination process can be accelerated by adding an additional 300 Âµl of the test medium to the 300 Âµl drop. This will allow the germlings to grow and attach to the coverslip before the plate is flooded with the 10 ml of PES.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="109" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200917/20200917020633_9858.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.
