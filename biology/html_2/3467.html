            <h1>Isolation and Stimulation of Peritoneal Macrophages with  Apoptotic Jurkat Cells to Produce IL-10</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Mei Song, Xiaojing   Ma</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages is critical to ensuring cellular homeostasis and suppression of autoimmunity. Macrophage recognition of apoptotic cells triggers an anti-inflammatory response, which is mediated by the release of IL-10, TGF-Î² <em>etc</em>. with concurrent inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNFÎ±, IL-12, IL-1Î²). To characterize cytokine profile produced by macrophages during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, we developed an effective, more physiologic system using isolated murine peritoneal macrophages and T-lymphocyte cell line Jurkat as a source of apoptotic cells. Apoptosis of Jurkat cells is induced with staurosporine, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor and detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. This <em>in vitro</em> assay demonstrates that murine peritoneal macrophages produce large amounts of IL-10 following exposure to apoptotic Jurkat cells.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Production of IL-10, a major immunoregulatory cytokine, by phagocytes during clearance of apoptotic cells is critical to ensuring cellular homeostasis and suppression of autoimmunity (Chung <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Little is known about the regulatory mechanisms in this fundamental process. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of IL-10 gene expression in macrophages upon interaction with apoptotic cells, we developed this protocol to explore key regulators of IL-10 production induced by apoptotic cells.</p>
