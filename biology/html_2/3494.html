            <h1>Automated Analysis of Cell Surface Ruffling: Ruffle Quantification Macro</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas D. Condon, Jennifer L. Stow, Adam A. Wall</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cell surface protrusions include F-actin rich, wave-like ruffles that are erected transiently in response to stimuli and during cell migration. Macrophages are innate immune cells that ruffle constitutively and more dramatically in cells activated by pathogens. Dorsal ruffles and their resulting macropinosomes are key sites for environmental sampling, pathogen detection and immune signaling. Quantitative assessment of ruffling is important for assessing pathogen responses in macrophages and for analysis of growth factor responses in other cell types but automated and quantitative methods are lacking, and rely on manual and qualitative assessments. Here we present an automated ImageJ macro for quantifying dorsal cell surface protrusions from 3D microscope images. The assay presented here is suitable for high-throughput screening applications to detect drug, pathogen, or growth factor induced changes in cell ruffling by measuring ruffle area and intensity and providing normalized values in an easy to read combined spreadsheet.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Cells develop ruffles or erect veils of membrane on their surfaces during migration and in responses to growth factors or other mediators. As innate immune cells, macrophages ruffle both constitutively and upon stimulation by growth factors, pathogens or other activating stimuli. Ruffles can take on different forms. Dorsal ruffles on the upper surface of adherent cells are typically large erect. F-actin-rich veils which can be circular (hence the alternative name âcircular dorsal rufflesâ) usually rise up transiently and then collapse back onto the surface. Ruffles often form macropinosomes as described in Condon <em>et al.</em>, 2018. Macropinosomes internalise the ruffle membrane, simultaneously ingesting fluid and soluble or small particulate cargo (Kerr and Teasdale, 2009; Commisso <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Dorsal ruffles or circular dorsal ruffles have been described in depth in macrophages, epithelial cells and fibroblasts where they have gained recognition as sites for immune cell activation (Luo <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Wall <em>et al.</em>, 2017), growth factor signaling (Buccione <em>et al.</em>, 2004) and activated receptor clustering, and internalisation that play pivotal roles in cancer cell signaling (Buccione <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Orth and McNiven, 2006). Dorsal ruffles are also induced by a number of pathogens, including <em>Salmonella entericia</em> serovar typhimurium at sites of pathogen entry (Ly and Casanova, 2007).<br/><br/>The large, circular dorsal ruffles that have been observed on different cell types are dependent on the transient production of F-actin, and inhibitors of F-actin polymerisation such as cytochalasin D abolish their formation (Hedberg <em>et al.</em>, 1993; Buccione <em>et al.</em>, 2004). As dorsal ruffles are highly enriched in F-actin and contribute a much greater area than other F-actin rich projections, such as filopodia, on the dorsal surface, fluorescent markers of F-actin are relatively enriched in dorsal ruffles. Many studies utilize the presence of dorsal ruffles as a qualitative read-out of cellular responses (Gurung <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Gandhi <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Singla <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The ability to quantify ruffling or F-actin cell surface protrusions, would provide useful analysis for a wide range of biological research ranging from stimulation assays to high-throughput screening. Ruffling has been assessed in images by taking whole-cell, whole field of view F-actin measurements (Schlam <em>et al.</em>, 2016) or by performing manual selection and user-interactive regions of interest (Venter <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/><br/>Here, we have developed a robust and automated assay for dorsal ruffle quantification that requires no user input for cell selection or segmentation of both basal and dorsal regions, defined by the mid-point of the nucleus. Measurements for ruffles are also made on Sum-slices images, meaning depth information is taken into account (<em>i.e.</em>, taller ruffles contribute to higher intensity counts). This assay enables batch processing of multiple images to analyse large cell numbers and provide tabulated results for easy statistical analysis using third party software. This robust, automated assay is well suited for screening cell populations to detect changes in dorsal ruffling induced by extracellular stimuli such as pathogens, growth factors, hormones or cytokines and/or large scale screening of pharmacological inhibitors, natural products, or nutritional conditions.</p>

towel.</li><li>Remove coverslips from 24-well plate and place cell-side up onto parafilm.</li><li>Add a drop of PBS onto each coverslip.<br/><em>Note: Coverslips should be kept âwetâ at all times

Nyquist sampling with a fluorescent microscope capable of serial optical sections, <em>i.e.</em>, Apotome, Confocal or widefield system (Figures 1A-1C) to capture the full 3-dimensional image of the cells and ruffles.</li><li>Acquire multiple fields of view for each condition (collecting at least 100 cells per treatment).<br/><em>Notes:</em><ol class="npwthree"><li><em>Images here were captured using a Zeiss Axioscan fluorescence upright microscope using a 40x 1.3 NA Plan Neofluar objective with an Axiocam 506 CCD camera. Samples were illuminated with HXP 120W whitelight source and filtered with Zeiss DAPI 49/FITC 44 filter cubes. Z-stacks were captured at 0.2 Î¼m intervals <strong>beyond both the visible top and bottom of the cells</strong> with 5 apotome phase shifts for optical sectioning to identify the midpoint of the nucleus and ruffles on the dorsal surface </em><em>(Figures 1D-1F)</em>.<br/></li><li><em>Nuclei Mid-point Offset determination. In its native form the script determines the mid-point of the nucleus by finding the slice where the cross-sectional area is greatest (Figure 1G). In macrophages, this suitably allows for the selection and segmentation of dorsal ruffles which are only present above this mid-point, however for alternate use cases, or different cell lines it may be required to use a different selection cut-off point. Figure 1H shows where peripheral ruffles may not be originally selected by using the nuclei mid-point, instead by applying an offset (of a few slices) the additional peripheral ruffle is selected (Figure 1H inset, grey arrow). The nuclei mid-point offset value allows for greater flexibility and broadens the use of the script to further analysis applications.</em><br/></li></ol><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="146" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200112/20200112093615_1638.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

The mid-point is determined by progressively measuring nuclei area within each slice. The slice with the greatest area of the nuclei is stored. The number of nuclei is also counted and stored for output (Figure 3A).<br/><em>Note: The Otsu thresholding method is used here to detect nuclei, the Otsu method finds the maximum point of inter-class variance between the foreground and the background and is suited where bi-modal distributions of intensity are expected.</em> </li><li>The F-actin (phalloidin) channel (channel 1) is extracted from the image stack into two separate images stacks, (1) the bottom half of the cell is taken (slice 1 to nuclei midpoint slice (ï± offset); Figure 3B) and (2) the top, ruffle area is taken (midpoint slice slice (ï± offset) to the top most slice; Figure 3E).</li><li>The cell area is determined by maximum Z-projecting the image slices (from slice 0 to the determined nuclei midpoint slice (Â± offset) and thresholding using the Triangle algorithm (to select total cell peripheries). and measured for output (Figure 3C). The thresholded flattened bottom image is then reduced using a distance map to separate close and/or touching cells. The distance map is then thresholded using the IJ_IsoData threshold algorithm and the number of âobjectsâ (cells) is estimated and stored for output (Figure 3D).<br/><em>Note: The Triangle algorithm is used here to detect cells, the algorithm is best suited for finding objects that may only be slightly above background (e.g., the very edges of cells) and is therefore used to create accurate selections for measuring cell area. For cell counting, the distance mapped thresholded cells are subjected to a Moments IJ_IsoData threshold as it selects for high-value maximums (e.g., the very center or cells) and thus will not be influenced by touching cells, provided accurate cell number counts.</em> </li><li>The ruffles are determined by sum Z-projecting the top F-actin channel (midpoint Â± offset to total/top number of slices) and measuring the intensity of the resultant 32-bit image (multiplied by the detected area). The flattened top/ruffle image is then thresholded using the Moments algorithm and the area of the thresholded ruffles is measured (Figure 3F) and used to determine regions of interest for directly measuring summed ruffle intensity.<br/><em>Note: The Moments algorithm is used here to threshold the ruffles, the algorithm works on a series of averaging steps, and selects regions above background but of varying intensity. This facilitates an accurate selection of all ruffles from the 32-bit sum projected image and not just the brightest objects.</em> </li><li>Calculations perform normalisations of ruffle area/cell area, and the intensity of the ruffles/cell area. These values are further normalized against the number of nuclei detected.</li><li>Images at key points in the macro are saved into the output folder (nuclei detection, cell area (bottom) and ruffle area (top), and a merged (green/red) RGB image of the ruffle selection overlayed the cell area image) for verification purposes (Figures 3G-3H).</li><li>All output values are written to the log window (Figure 3I), and the output .csv file into a subdirectory called Analysis_Results_<date&time> (Figure 3J).</date&time></li><li>Quantified data from the analysis is stored as a .csv file with ratios and normalization to cell number already calculated (Figure 3K).
