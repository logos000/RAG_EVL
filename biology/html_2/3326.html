            <h1>Visualizing Hypoxia in a Murine Model of <em>Candida albicans</em> Infection Using <em>in vivo</em> Biofluorencence</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> JosÃ© Pedro Lopes, Constantin F. Urban</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><em>Candida albicans</em> is a leading human fungal pathogen that uses several metabolic adaptations to escape immune cells and causes systemic disease. Here, we describe a protocol for measuring one of these adaptations, the ability to thrive in hypoxic niches. Hypoxia was generated after successful subdermal infection with <em>C. albicans</em> in a murine infection model. Hypoxia was measured using a fluorescent dye for carbonic anhydrase 9, a host enzyme active under hypoxic conditions. Emitted fluorescence was subsequently quantified using an IVIS system. This protocol was optimized for the use in subdermal infection in mice but has the potential to be adapted to other models of fungal infection.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Fungal colonizers of humans have evolved to sense and adapt to niches available in the host (Grahl and Cramer, 2010). Oxygen is a changing environmental parameter. Levels change in different tissues and during different stages of infection and immune activation (Carreau <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Wenger <em>et al.</em>, 2015). The ability to sustain growth and to survive in low oxygen environments has been linked to virulence in several fungi (Shepardson <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Gresnigt <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Pradhan <em>et al.</em>, 2018). We have developed a protocol to follow the generation of hypoxia in a mouse infected with <em>C. albicans</em> (Lopes <em>et al.</em>, 2018). We chose subdermal infection as a local, non-disseminated model of mycosis with acute onset which allows analysis of hypoxia in a confined space, where <em>C. albicans</em> and host cells interact (Urban <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Santus <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Thereby, natural variation of oxygen levels in other tissues can be eliminated and secondary effects from distant locations arising in systemic infection can be avoided. During infection, hypoxia is created mainly by neutrophil influx to the site of infection. Neutrophil extravasation and the activation of oxygen-consuming enzymes create environments with low oxygen levels. In turn, <em>C. albicans</em> exploits this environmental shift to avoid immune recognition by changing cell wall composition leading to masking of recognized entities (Lopes <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p>
