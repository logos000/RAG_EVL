            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Our mechanistic understanding of cell function depends on imaging biological processes in cells with molecular resolution. Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy plays a crucial role by reporting cellular ultrastructure with 20-30 nm resolution. However, this resolution is insufficient to image macro-molecular machinery at work. A path to improve resolution is to image under cryogenic conditions, which substantially increases the brightness of most fluorophores and preserves native ultrastructure much better than chemical fixatives. Cryogenic conditions are, however, underutilized because of the lack of compatible high numerical aperture (NA) objectives. Here we describe a protocol for the use of super-hemispherical solid immersion lenses (<em>super</em>SILs) to achieve super-resolution imaging at cryogenic temperatures with an effective NA of 2.17 and resolution of ~10 nm.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Fluorescence microscopy has for many years been one of the most important tools for understanding how biological systems are organized and how they function. Over the last decade, fluorescence microscopy has been revolutionized by the development of âsuper-resolutionâ methods that extend the limit of optical microscopy beyond the diffraction limit, providing unprecedented levels of information on the organization of molecular networks in cells. These methods include Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) (Gustafsson, 2000), Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy (STED) (Hell and Wichmann, 1994), and techniques based on the localization of individual fluorescent molecules with much better precision than the diffraction limit. The latter includes Photo-activated Localization Microscopy (PALM) (Betzig <em>et al.</em>, 2006) and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) (Rust <em>et al.</em>, 2006), referred to collectively in this protocol as Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) techniques. Because of a requirement to stop motion within the cell when aiming for high resolution, super-resolution methods usually involve the use of chemical fixation, which has the potential to introduce artefacts that can be visible at the resolutions achieved (Whelan and Bell, 2015). This problem has long been recognized in the field of electron microscopy, where a different method is now routinely used to fix cells and preserve their structure: vitrification at cryogenic temperatures. In this method, samples are frozen using a cryogen, cooling rapidly to temperatures of -150 Â°C or below, resulting in the formation of amorphous ice, with the high rate of cooling preventing the formation of ice crystals (Dubochet and McDowall, 1981). SMLM techniques in particular should benefit from the use of cryogenic conditions. This is because the localization precision of fluorescent molecules is dependent on the number of photons emitted by the fluorophores (Thompson <em>et al.</em>, 2002), and at cryogenic temperatures significantly more photons can be collected. Conventional widefield fluorescence microscopy at cryogenic temperatures is already used in Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) (de Boer <em>et al.</em>, 2015) workflows, but the mismatch in resolution between optical microscopy and EM limits the value of the fluorescence data, which is usually restricted to locating general areas of interest. Hence, enabling cryogenic super-resolution fluorescence microscopy would be a significant advance for cryogenic CLEM workflows.<br/><br/>Given the advantages of vitrification over chemical fixation, it would be advantageous to apply it to super-resolution optical microscopy methods. However, its use has been severely limited for one major reason: super-resolution methods require the use of high numerical aperture (NA) objective lenses (NA &gt; 1), and achieving this NA typically requires the use of oil immersion objectives, incompatible with cryogenic microscopy. A number of approaches have been taken to avoid this problem, including using non-immersion objectives with extremely bright fluorophores (Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2015) and using special cryogenic immersion fluids and custom sample stages (Nahmani <em>et al.</em>, 2017). However, these approaches have not been generally applied to the imaging of biological samples.<br/><br/>We have developed a low-cost, generally applicable method for super-resolution cryo-fluorescence microscopy that uses commercially available optical components and cryo-stage (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2019). For this, we use super-hemispherical solid-immersion lenses (<em>super</em>SILs). These lenses are made of high refractive index materials, and take the form of truncated spheres. In our application, their role is to take the place of immersion oil, and fill the gap between the sample and a conventional non-immersion objective. The combination of <em>super</em>SIL and air objective gives a high numerical aperture, dependent on the refractive index of the lens material (Terris <em>et al.</em>, 1994; Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2013).<br/> <br/>We have characterized the performance of <em>super</em>SILs for cryo-SMLM, showing that we are able to achieve a point spread function (PSF) size of around 150 nm, compared with around 330 nm for a cryogenic microscope with a conventional low NA air objective. This is because the combination of <em>super</em>SIL and objective achieves a NA of 2.17, much higher than the maximum NA of ~1.4 of oil-immersion objectives. The <em>super</em>SIL microscope achieves single molecule localization precisions of &lt; 10 nm, and a lateral resolution of 12 nm (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2019). A major advantage of the <em>super</em>SIL method is that it can be achieved using readily available off-the-shelf components, with the possibility of easily adding the cryostage to microscopes commonly found in cell biology research laboratories. Moreover, <em>super</em>SIL assemblies can be cleaned and reused multiple times, making them an inexpensive resource. In this protocol, we focus on use of the <em>super</em>SIL system for super-resolution microscopy of bacteria, but also indicate how it might be applied to imaging of mammalian cells. A similar protocol could also be used to image other samples, such as purified protein complexes or vesicles. Used as described, the protocol provides a straightforward method for super-resolution imaging of biological samples at cryogenic temperatures, with the advantage of avoiding potential fixation artefacts. The resolution and localization precision achieved are significantly better than those routinely obtained in conventional room temperature SMLM microscopes. These advantages alone should make <em>super</em>SIL SMLM microscopy a valuable addition to the toolbox of cell biology researchers.<br/><br/>It is also possible to consider other potential advantages of the <em>super</em>SIL microscopy protocol. Firstly, because of the ultra-high NA, the resolution that can be achieved even at room temperature is significantly better than that obtained in conventional SMLM microscopes. The <em>super</em>SIL protocol therefore provides a simple low-cost method by which a basic fluorescence microscope could be converted to a high-performance super-resolution system. Our protocol describes use of the <em>super</em>SIL in an upright microscope, but the method could also be used in an inverted microscope by using a modified version of the <em>super</em>SIL assembly.<br/> <br/>We believe that <em>super</em>SIL microscopy could have an important role to play in CLEM, helping to bridge the resolution gap between cryo-fluorescence microscopy and EM. We do not describe any CLEM approaches in this protocol, but possible methodologies could involve the transferring and imaging of thin lamellae produced by focused ion beam (FIB) milling under both <em>super</em>SIL and transmission EM modes, or the correlation of <em>super</em>SIL SMLM images with serial block-face scanning EM. Given the small size of the lens assembly, it may also be possible to incorporate a <em>super</em>SIL into the stage of an electron microscope, potentially permitting simultaneous or near-simultaneous imaging of the same sample with both light and electrons.</p>

Finding focus under bright field illumination.</strong> The top of the <em>super</em>SIL curved surface is shown focused in (A), viewed under the 50x, 0.75 NA objective lens. Viewing through the <em>super</em>SIL, characteristic scratches on the flat surface should become visible under bright field illumination, shown in (B), indicating that the sample plane is in focus. Scale bar: 10 Âµm.<br/><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Start Micro-Manager and bring up a live view of the camera(s).</li><li>Switch on the bright field condenser LED built-in to the Linkam CMS196M.</li><li>Lower the microscope objective in to the Linkam chamber towards the <em>super</em>SIL. Monitor the green channel camera output. Pay close attention to the distance between the objective and <em>super</em>SIL; a collision will likely destroy the Linkam brass bridge leading to large repair costs and delays.<br/><em>Note: Light from the built-in LED condenser is unlikely to appear in the red channel.</em> </li><li>As the objective approaches the <em>super</em>SIL, you will notice the brightness of the green channel increase. Adjust the microscope stage laterally to ensure the brightest area remains in the center of the cameraâs field of view as you lower the objective further.</li><li>The curved surface of the <em>super</em>SIL will appear in focus. Translate the microscope stage laterally so the very top of the curved surface is in the center of the cameraâs field of view (Figure 5A) and the periphery blurs out of focus.</li><li>Now lower the objective approximately 1 mm to find the virtual imaging plane that is located below the flat surface of the <em>super</em>SIL. You will notice inherent scratches in the flat surface of the <em>super</em>SIL appearing into focus first (Figure 5B). If the ice that has been produced in the plunge-freezing procedure is relatively thin, the plane at which the sample is located should be very close to this flat surface of the <em>super</em>SIL.<br/><br/></li></ol></li><li>Imaging<br/><em>Note: You have the option to store the collected images in memory or to stream them straight to hard disk. sCMOS cameras produce large quantities of data so make sure you have enough available space before continuing otherwise the system may become unresponsive and crash. A typical dual-color STORM experiment comprising of 10,000 full-frames per channel consumes approximately 10 GB of data. Computer memory equal to or greater than 32 GB and a solid-state hard drive of capacity equal to or greater than 1 TB is recommended as a minimum requirement.</em><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Take an optional bright field image snapshot.

Wait for the sample to photo-bleach sufficiently until you see clear well-separated single molecules blinking. Increase the laser power density if necessary until you observe the desired blinking characteristics for your fluorophore of choice. The time that the molecule spends in its emitting bright state should be as low as possible compared to the time spent in the dark state.</li><li>Adjust the camera exposure time and acquire an appropriate number of frames for your experiment based on your fluorophore of choice and sample conditions.

This can be verified by selecting the reconstructed image window and navigating to âImage &gt; Propertiesâ. The pixel size should be set to that of the camera divided by the final magnification used in the visualization settings of ThunderSTORM. For instance, if you have a pixel size of 46.8 nm and chose to have a 5x final magnification, then your reconstructed pixel size is 9.36 nm.</li><li>You can now measure approximate distances between features using the ruler tool located on the main ImageJ toolbar.<br/><br/></li></ol></li><li>Advanced data analysis<br/>The .csv data table generated by ThunderSTORM can be imported into other software packages for advanced data analysis, including single-molecule clustering, stoichiometry and co-localization between channels.</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30362">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>LB medium<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Weigh out 25 g of granules</li><li>Add 1 L of MilliQ water</li><li>Adjust pH to 7.2 using HCl</li><li>Autoclave to sterilize</li></ol></li><li>Piranha Solution<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Add 900 Î¼l of concentrated sulphuric acid to a glass scintillation vial</li><li>Add 300 Î¼l of 30% hydrogen peroxide to the vial and quickly mix<br/><em>Note: The vial will heat up considerably.</em><br/></li><li>Use immediately.
