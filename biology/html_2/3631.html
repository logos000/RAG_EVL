            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>As obesity becomes a global epidemic, the metabolism research field is increasingly focusing on studying the physiological and pathological roles of adipose tissues (AT). However, extracting proteins from AT is challenging due to abundant fat content of intracellular lipid droplets. Several commercial kits for extraction of AT proteins are available, as are protocols (such as the RELi protocol as well as other protein precipitation protocols). The protocols have been introduced to improve the quality and yield of extractions, but these methods either increase the cost or involve multiple steps. Herein, we describe a detailed protocol for mouse AT protein extractions based on our daily laboratory practice. This protocol requires only very common reagents and instruments, and can be completed in 90-120 min and provides good recovery of total protein content. Thus, this protocol is an economically attractive, time-saving and efficient way to extract proteins from the AT.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Investigating adipose tissue (AT) to address issues related to the pathophysiology of obesity frequently involves analyzing AT proteins. However, lipid contamination in AT protein samples profoundly affects the accuracy of protein quantification, the quality of Western Blotting images, and the sample processing for downstream applications. To minimize lipid contamination, commercial kits have been developed, such as the Minute<sup>TM</sup> Total Protein Extraction Kit for Adipose Tissues/Cultured Adipocytes (Invent Biotechnologies Inc., 2017). More comprehensive protocols aim to reduce lipid content, such as the Removal of Excess Lipids (RELi) protocol (Diaz Marin <em>et al.</em>, 2019) and the trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-based protein precipitation method (Benabdelkamel <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Although improved extraction quality has been demonstrated utilizing the above procedures, the disadvantages of these methods are also obvious: taking advantage of commercially available kits involves considerably higher costs; comprehensive protocols involve multiple steps, consume much more time, and might compromise total yields.<br/><br/>Herein, we aim to describe a detailed mouse AT protein extraction protocol that has been widely applied in our laboratory (An <em>et al.</em>, 2017 and 2019), not only to overcome the lipid contamination problem, but also to represent an easier to handle as well as a time and cost effective way to achieve high yields of total protein extraction from mouse AT. Our protocol requires very common reagents and instruments, and is therefore budget-friendly and can be routinely performed in most laboratories, even in those new to adipose biology research. The whole process of extracting proteins from frozen adipose tissues takes approximately 90-120 min, and is therefore a time effective approach. Furthermore, this protocol ensures maximal depletion of lipid contamination by removing the lipid layer before adding detergents and repeated centrifugation after tissue lysis. Last but not least, the protocol allows to recover a total of ~2.0 mg protein from ~100 mg white adipose tissues (~4.0 mg protein from ~100 mg brown adipose tissues), which is sufficient for several rounds of Western Blot analyses as well as other applications. Thus, the protocol below is a cost effective, time-saving and efficient protocol to extract proteins from different fat pads.</p>
