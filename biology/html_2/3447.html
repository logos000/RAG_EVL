            <h1>Evoked Potential Recordings of Auditory Brainstem Activity in the Mouse: An Optimized Method for the Assessment of Hearing Function of Mice</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Neil J. Ingham</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Hearing loss is a common sensory deficiency suffered by millions worldwide. It is a heterogeneous condition and genetics plays a critical role in its etiology. Gene variants can fundamentally alter hearing function, or predispose the auditory system towards loss of function resulting from other factors. In mouse studies of hearing loss and gene function, an evoked potential electrophysiological recording, the auditory brainstem response (ABR), is now considered the optimal way to screen large numbers of individuals, either with normal hearing sensitivity or with hearing impairment. Other routinely used methods to assess hearing function (such as acoustic startle responses, or otoacoustic emissions) do not allow assessment of the same broad spectrum of dysfunction nor readily allow the threshold sensitivity of the neural output of the cochlea to be assessed and are less ideal. An optimized recording system to rapidly and reproducibly record high-quality ABRs from mutant mice as part of a high-throughput phenotyping pipeline was developed. Click-evoked ABRs and ABRs evoked by pure-tone frequencies over a range of sound levels from 0 dB to 95 dB, sound pressure levels (SPL) are recorded. This takes approximately 15-20 min per mouse (with 5 tone frequencies), allowing a large number of mutant mice to be screened. This method has been used to measure ABRs on a high-throughput mutant mouse phenotyping pipeline and in laboratory tests to follow-up the hearing loss phenotypes identified on that pipeline.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Hearing impairment is a widespread sensory deficiency suffered by millions worldwide, of all ages and gender. Effects sizes can range from mild to severe. It can be congenital or develop later in life, often in a frequency-dependent age-related progressive manner. Numerous and varied pathologies can contribute to or be responsible for hearing loss (Davis 1995; Fortnum <em>et al.</em>, 2001). Environmental conditions, such as noise exposure or drug-toxicity, can also have profound effects on hearing ability. Genetics is known to play many crucial roles in the early development of hearing and in the maintenance of hearing function into old age, as well as in predisposing the auditory system towards pathology or protecting the system against pathological decline. With the development of molecular methods to target the function of specific genes in the mouse and the emergence of phenotyping programs to investigate the systemic roles of these genes, it became necessary to develop a sensitive, rapid, robust and reproducible method to screen hearing function in these mutant animals.<br/> <br/>Measurement of the Preyer Reflex (an acoustic startle response) can be used to quickly test very high numbers of animals, but it can detect only severe hearing loss and may be affected by motor system deficiencies in mutant mice. Measurements of otoacoustic emissions can be performed quickly and non-invasively, but they do not detect as many pathological conditions as measures of the output of the cochlea as a whole. The Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), an electrophysiological response incorporating auditory nerve and auditory brainstem activity, is considered the ideal method to assess hearing function across large numbers of mice.<br/><br/><strong>Table 1.

The usefulness of a particular method to assess a particular function is indicated as a binary Yes/No choice. <strong>Yes</strong>, indicates that a test may give results to aid identification/diagnosis of a particular problem. <strong>No</strong>, indicates the test may not useful for this purpose. <strong>Middle Ear Conductive HL</strong>, is the test helpful to detect a conductive hearing loss, such as otitis media. <strong>IHC dysfunction</strong>, to detect Inner Hair Cell dysfunction. <strong>OHC dysfunction</strong>, to detect Outer Hair Cell dysfunction. <strong>SV dysfunction</strong>, to detect dysfunction of the Stria Vascularis. <strong>Inner Ear developmental problems</strong>, to detect early developmental issues affecting the inner ear. <strong>Age-Related HL</strong>, helpful to detect aspects of progressive hearing loss, if appropriate frequency stimuli are used. <strong>Involves other neural systems</strong>, can be influenced by dysfunction of other neural systems, such as descending inputs to the cochlea, motor systems, sensori-motor integration, <em>etc</em>. <strong>Assessment of cochlear sensitivity</strong>, to assess thresholds as an estimate of the sensitivity of cochlear function. <strong>Assessment of CAS function</strong>, to detect dysfunction within the Central Auditory System. <strong>High-Throughput</strong>, is the test amenable to high-throughput screening (<em>e.g.</em>, simple and quick to set-up, short recording time, able to detect a broad spectrum of auditory dysfunction, <em>etc.</em>). The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is considered the best overall method to detect the widest spectrum of hearing impairment pathologies in a high-throughput screen where very large numbers (1000âsâ10,000âs) of individual animals need to be assessed. <br/> <br/>The method described here was adopted as the standard protocol used as a screen of hearing function by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC, <a href="https://www.mousephenotype.org/" target="_blank">https://www.mousephenotype.org</a>) at numerous research centers worldwide (summarized in Bowl <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Detailed analyses of the data produced using this method at the Wellcome Sanger Institute have been published (White <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Ingham <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Whilst ABRs are commonly used to examine auditory function across a range of species, this method is optimized for rapid measurements in the mouse.<br/><br/>The ABR method, and our customized software, has been used in many secondary phenotyping studies to contribute to more detailed characterization of mutant phenotypes identified in the high-throughput screen (Ingham <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The description presented here has been updated to reflect currently available digital signal processing technology. The method can easily be modified to perform evoked potential studies tailored towards more bespoke data collection and analysis requirements of individual studies (<em>e.g.</em>, Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Buniello <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Ingham <em>et al.</em>, 2016) and can be used to assess more complex aspects of auditory function. For example, we can measure frequency tuning curves (Ebrahim <em>et al.</em>, 2016), forward masking functions (Kuhn <em>et al.</em>, 2011), and other measures of auditory temporal processing, based on assessment of ABR wave 1 amplitude (and latency). With training and experience, experimenters can use this system to generate high quality ABR recordings and produce reproducible measurements of threshold sensitivity, waveform shape and peak amplitude and latency, to give mean values with low associated variance helping to increase the statistical power of the method (<em>e.g.</em>, Ingham <em>et al.</em>, 2017).<br/></p>

Mice are anesthetized using intra-peritoneal Ketamine (100 mg/kg) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg), see Recipe 1.</li><li>After injection, mice are kept in a warm sleep cage until deeply sedated (when the righting reflex, corneal-blink reflex and pedal-withdrawal reflex are abolished; which may take from 5-10 minutes following injection) and then placed on a heating blanket located inside the sound attenuating booth where the electrophysiological recordings will take place. To speed up the procedure, the feedback probe is not inserted rectally, but instead is situated inside the blanket cover underneath the mouse. The blanket controller is set to maintain a temperature of 37 Â°C to ensure the mouse core temperature is not adversely affected during the recording. The induction anaesthetic dose is usually sufficient for the duration of the recording procedure but can be topped-up if necessary, using 30-50% doses.</li><li>Sub-cutaneous needle electrodes (bent into a hook shape; Figure 1A) are inserted through a pinch of skin on the cranial vertex (connected to the active channel 1 input of the RA4LI or Medusa4Z headstage) and overlying the ventral region of the left bulla (connected to the headstage reference input) and right bulla (connected to the headstage ground input) (see Figures 1B and 1C). This electrode arrangement does not abolish artifact potentials (such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), but does minimize them. The hook shape facilitates an accurate insertion point and ensures that the recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is picked up from a limited anatomical area. No local anesthetic needs to be applied prior to electrode insertion as the mice are already deeply sedated and areflexic.</li><li>Stimuli are presented as free-field sounds (not coupled into the ear-canal) from a loudspeaker whose leading edge is positioned 20 cm in front of the mouseâs interaural axis on the midline. This distance gives sufficient space to easily swap mice in and out of the set-up without accidently dislodging the loudspeaker position, whilst maintaining close proximity to ensure 95 dB SPL levels can be achieved at the mouse head position.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191202/20191202224031_7910.jpg" width="181"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Subcutaneous electrode shape and placement.</strong> (A) Individual needle electrodes are bent into a square hook shape using a needle holder, with each side approxiamtely 2 mm long. The hook is inserted through a pinch of skin, such that the contact with the subdermal layers lies on the remaining straight shaft of the electrode. A ground electrode is placed in the skin overlying the bulla behind the right ear (B). The active electrode for the low-impedance bio-amplifier is placed on the midline in a rostro-caudal position lined up with the leading edge of the 2 pinnae (C). The reference electrode for the bio-amplifier is inserted behind the left ear (D), in an equivalent location to the ground electrode (modified from Ingham <em>et al.</em>, 2011).<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Stimulus generation<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Stimuli are generated under the control the âAveragerâ software package.

The PCB microphone is positioned at a 20 cm distance from the leading edge of the loudspeaker (where the mouse head will subsequently be placed), pointing towards the loudspeaker. Under software control, broadband noise bursts (generated from random number sequences) are presented from the loudspeaker. The signal recorded by the microphone is amplified by 40 dB and recorded at approximately 200 kHz sampling rate on the RA6-A-P1 processor. The software calculates a Fast Fourier Transformation of the microphone signal to generate a frequency response representing the maximum output of the loudspeaker across frequency. This frequency response will be subsequently used by the software to calculate the dB attenuation level required to present each stimulus frequency at the desired dB sound pressure level (SPL). <strong>This step will need to be performed before the mouse is anesthetized and placed into the experimental setup within the sound attenuating booth.</strong> </li><li>âAveragerâ software is used to control the RZ6-A-P1 processor to deliver click (0.01 ms duration) and tone pip (variable frequencies from 3-42 kHz of 5 ms duration, 1 ms rise/fall time) stimuli over a range of intensity levels from 0-95 dB sound pressure level (SPL, re. 5 Î¼Pa) in 5 dB steps. Stimuli are generated at a sampling rate of approximately 100 kHz before being attenuated, amplified and delivered to the sound transducer to produce the desired SPL at the mouse head location.</li><li>Once triggered to begin, the âAveragerâ software and the RZ6-A-P1 processor control stimulus presentation and response recording synchronously.

This recording can easily be repeated if troubleshooting of the experimental setup is required. In addition to recording no response if the mouse is expected/known to be severely-profoundly impaired, there may be numerous other simple reasons that an evoked response is not seen; for example, the operator should check that a) the loudspeaker is properly connected, b) that the electrodes are properly connected to the mouse and headstage, c) that the electrode headstage and preamplifier are connected and switched on, d) there is no excessive electrical noise on the recording trace and e) that the mouse is still alive.</li><li>A series of click-evoked ABRs are then recorded, ranging from 0-95 dB SPL in 5 dB intervals.</li><li>Tone-evoked ABRs are recorded for a fixed set of frequencies (typically, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 kHz although the data collection can easily be expanded to capture responses to 3, 36 and 42 kHz tone-pips) over sound levels ranging from 0 to 95 dB SPL in 5 dB intervals.

Threshold (dB SPL) is estimated by visual inspection of the stacked ABR traces and defined as the lowest sound level where any component of the ABR waveform is recognizable and consistent with responses recorded at higher sound levels, taking into account the characteristic lengthening of peak latency as threshold is approached. Thresholds for each stimulus are plotted to give a profile of the hearing sensitivity of each mouse (Figure 3A). Plots of mean threshold (Â± standard deviation) in control and mutant groups are used to assess the overall hearing profile of a mutant group. It can also be informative to plot individual mutant and/or control thresholds alongside the groups means (Figure 4).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="120" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191202/20191202224122_5038.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

The threshold sensitivity of each response set, determined by visual inspection of the responses by an experienced experimenter, are indicated by a thickened line on each panel.

These data were obtained from a high-throughput phenotyping screen where it was not feasible to record from littermate control mice. These data have been published previously in Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Maguire <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Buniello <em>et al.</em>, 2016 and Ingham <em>et al.</em>, 2019.<br/><br/></li><li>Classification of mouse ABR audiograms<br/>Patterns of raised thresholds for ABRs were classified according to the following criteria: <strong>Severe-Profound</strong>, if no responses were detected (up to 95 dB SPL) for at least 2 adjacent frequency stimuli, for all mice of that genotype; <strong>High-Frequency</strong>, if thresholds were elevated at 30 kHz (by &gt; 30 dB) and thresholds were not elevated for at least one of the lower frequency stimuli; <strong>Low-Frequency</strong>, if thresholds were elevated for 6 and 12 kHz and were normal for at least one of the higher frequency stimuli (with a minimum mean threshold elevation &lt; 15 dB); <strong>Moderate</strong>, where thresholds were significantly elevated for at least 4 of the 6 stimuli tested (with a minimum mean threshold elevation &gt; 15 dB); <strong>Mild</strong>, where mean thresholds were elevated by 30 dB or less for up to 3 stimuli tested; <strong>Normal Hearing</strong>, where no stimuli produced altered thresholds. Figure 4 illustrates one example of each classification of audiogram [see Ingham <em>et al.</em> (2019) for further examples].<br/><br/></li><li>ABR waveform shape comparisons<br/>Through consistent, reproducible electrode placements and recording with good signal: noise ratio, it is possible to compare, qualitatively and quantitatively, the waveform shapes of stimulus-evoked ABRs. Wave 1 is understood to reflect auditory nerve activity, but as the responses represent a complex summation of responses detected at a single point on the scalp, there is some uncertainty in ascribing specific brain locations to specific features of the ABR waveform. The free-field binaural (<em>i.e.</em>, both ear canals open) stimulation conditions we use complicates interpretation further, as there are binaural interactions throughout the auditory brainstem, even as low down as the cochlear nucleus. The ABR represents the summed electrical vectors detected by the electrodes as synchronized action potential volleys (particularly from onset-responding neurons) traverse the central auditory pathways. As these pathways can be both excitatory and inhibitory as well as both ascending and descending, and are distributed in a 3D volume, interpretation is complex. <br/>  Waveforms recorded to clicks and tone-pips at fixed dB SPL level, or at fixed levels above threshold (sensation level, dB SL) are plotted for mutant and control mice, along with an average of the ABR amplitude across mice for each genotype. In these responses, 4 waves (positive to negative deflections; Figures 2, 3 and 5) are generally observed. Given that both the latency and amplitude of ABR waves change with changing stimulus level, it is appropriate to plot waveforms (from individual mice and mean waveforms) at a fixed dB SL. This takes account of threshold differences between individuals and gives a mean waveform with reduced variability, facilitating comparison between control and mutant groups.<br/>  Additional metrics can be derived from the ABR waveforms, such as the half width of a wave component (for an example of this methodology, see Harris <em>et al.</em>, 2018). However, such analyses are not discussed further here.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191202/20191202224251_3447.jpg" width="135"/><br/><strong>Figure 5. Waveform analyses of tone pipâevoked ABRs.</strong> [These data were described in Ingham <em>et al.</em> (2017)]. Black lines and symbols indicate data recorded from 12 wildtype littermate control mice (<em>EphA2<sup>+/+</sup></em>). Red lines and symbols indicate data recorded from 23 <em>EphA2</em> homozygous mutant mice (<em>EphA2<sup>-/-</sup></em>). A and B. ABRs recorded from individual mice evoked by 40 dB SL 18 kHz tone pips. C. Mean amplitudes of the wildtype and mutant responses shown in A and B are plotted.

Mean (Â± standard deviation) amplitude is plotted against sound level above threshold (dB SL, sensation level). E. Input/Output Functions for the peak latency of waves P1-P4 and N-N4 are plotted. Mean (Â± standard deviation) latency is plotted against sound level above threshold (dB SL). F. Input/Output Functions for 3 inter-peak intervals are plotted. Mean (Â± standard deviation) interval time is plotted against sound level above threshold (dB SL). These data illustrate that ABR responses between individual animals can be highly reproducible. In this case, there were no significant differences in the waveform response properties recorded from littermate wildtype and <em>EphA2</em> mutant mice.<br/><br/></li><li>Input-Output functions (IOFs)<br/>ABR waves are quantified to determine the amplitude and latency of positive and negative peaks of the waveform at each stimulus level recorded (Figure 3). This can be performed using software routines developed by Dr. B.N. Buran (Buran <em>et al.</em>, 2010). From these measures, we calculate the peak-peak amplitude and latencies of waves 1-4 and inter-peak intervals (for example, P1-P2, P1-P3, P1-P4). IOF curves are plotted relative to click threshold for each mouse (<em>i.e.</em>, parameter plotted against dB SL). IOFs of individual mice (mutants and littermate controls) are compiled and the mean (Â± standard deviation) for each parameter is plotted.<br/><br/></li><li>Statistical analyses<br/>It is rare that populations of the various parameters (for example, thresholds or wave amplitude) derived from ABRs follow a normal distribution. Therefore, the researcher will need to give careful consideration as to the most appropriate statistical comparisons to apply to their datasets. Many of the parameters likely to be tested cannot be considered completely independent (for example, the threshold of adjacent tone-pip stimuli cannot be considered independent due to mechanical coupling along the basilar membrane of the cochlea). Thus, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) testing is considered more appropriate to compare the range of thresholds tested across different stimuli, rather than multiple individual comparisons of the different stimuli. Non-parametric tests will need to be used for datasets that do not conform to a normal distribution. Such tests are available in many software packages (for example, SigmaPlot, SPSS, <em>etc.</em>)</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30515">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>It is crucial to use ABRs from normal hearing littermate control mice to compare responses obtained from mutant mice with abnormal/impaired hearing. This ensures that all mice have the same experiences during their development (such as noise-levels, cage-cleaning disturbance, <em>etc.</em>). This also ensures that control mice used are of the same genetic background.</li><li>The background strain can have profound differences on the responses recorded. For example, C57BL/6N mice carry a variant of the <em>Cdh23</em> gene which predisposes them to early onset high frequency hearing loss, whereas CBA/CaJ mice show very limited age-related elevations in hearing sensitivity. Differences in genetic background may also result in altered modifiers of gene function such that a hearing phenotype present in mutants of a particular strain is lost when the mutation is crossed onto a different background strain.</li><li>If researchers are comparing ABRs across different age ranges, either from repeated measurements in the same animals, or from separate cohorts of animals at different ages, it is important to limit the age-variation in each group. When testing 2-3 weeks old mice, it is advisable to perform the ABR tests at an exact age; for example, post-natal day (P) 14 Â± 0 days or P21 Â± 0 days. As the mice get older, increasing age-variation is more acceptable; for example, 4 weeks old (P28 Â± 1 day), 6 weeks old (P42 Â± 2 days), 8 weeks old (P56 Â± 3 days), 14 weeks (P98 Â± 3 days), 6 months old (P182 Â± 4 days), 1 year old (P365 Â± 7 days). It is vital to age-match control and mutant groups when comparing ABR data in mice. At younger ages, under 6-8 weeks old, the auditory system is still undergoing maturation with improving threshold sensitivity and increasing response amplitude up to 6-8 weeks old. This maturation is particularly rapid after the onset of hearing at around P12, up to around 4 weeks old and therefore it is especially important to exactly age-match younger test groups.</li><li>Researchers should give serious consideration to blind-testing their mice, such that the genotype (or other parameters) of individual animals is not known by the experimenter at the time of data collection or data analysis. It is important to remove potential sources of bias during data collection and analysis.</li><li>Consideration of gender is important and researchers may need to perform separate analyses on male and female control and mutant mice to fully expose any differences in responses caused by the many different factors present in male vs. female mice. It becoming increasing important to consider sex as a biological variable (SABV) in auditory experimentation.</li><li>Researchers should perform a series of pilot experiments to determine the variability of their responses and data and to perform appropriate power calculations to help to estimate the number of experimental animals that might be required to see a given effect size. From experience, the data obtained from these methods are rarely normally distributed (for example, as determined by the Shaprio-Wilk Normality test) and researchers will need to determine whether parametric or non-parametric statistical tests are best suited to their data. In our research, it is often the case that data from a minimum of 6 mice are required to perform statistical comparisons at a sufficient power level, although if responses are more variable, we aim for larger sample sizes.</li><li>Use a homeothermic heating blanket system to prevent loss of body temperature in the mice. Anaesthetised mice can become hypothermic very quickly and the accompanying drop in metabolic rate will seriously affect the efficiency of inner ear function and result in artifactually high thresholds across all frequencies (around 20 dB elevations), but especially above 32 kHz (&gt; 30 dB elevations) in the mouse (Henry and Chole, 1984). </li><li>Use a sound attenuating booth to reduce background (masking) acoustic noise. The booth should also be grounded (and thus act as a Faraday cage) to ensure low levels of ambient electrical noise which interferes with low-impedance recording systems. </li><li>Ensure that the needle electrodes are inserted sub-dermally to give good electrical contact with the animal (lower impedance) and reduced electrical noise on the recorded traces. The hook shape employed here ensures an accurate and reproducible insertion point across many animals and helps to give reproducible ABR waveform shapes. On insertion, the hooked portion of the electrodes is pushed through the pinch of skin, such that the skin sits on the remaining straight shaft of the electrode. Despite the limited area of the needle electrode remaining in the skin, it is still feasible to obtain low impedances of &lt; 5 kâ¦ (ideally, 1-3 kâ¦), tested via the TDT electrode headstage. To achieve better recordings, it is important that the impedance of the active input channel and the reference input channel are in a matching or similar impedance range.</li><li>Ensure that the mouse achieves a sufficient depth of anesthesia. With the Ketamine/Xylazine dose suggested here, mice will quickly lose their righting and corneal reflexes. Abolition of pedal withdrawal reflexes may take longer. From a welfare point of view, it is important that the animal does not respond to insertion of the needle electrodes. Furthermore, if the mouse remains only lightly anaesthetized, it will maintain a higher degree of muscle tone. This will introduce excessive myogenic electrical activity onto the recording and should be avoided. Such noise is easily identifiable when viewing the electrode activity on the oscilloscope (rather than the averaged response traces). Recordings can be paused, an anesthesia top-up given if required, and restarted once the myogenic noise has diminished.</li><li>It is important to minimize these sources of electrical noise to prevent low amplitude ABR waveforms from being masked. Such masking can produce an artificial elevation of the estimated ABR threshold as the peak and trough features of the waveform used to identify if an ABR is present will be obscured in the noise floor of the recording and only become visible at higher dB SPLs.</li><li>The microphone used for calibration of the stimulus system should itself be regularly calibrated (<em>e.g.</em>, quarterly/biannually) to ensure that the sound levels presented to mice are consistent over long periods of time. This can be achieved in the usersâ own laboratory if appropriate specialist equipment is available, or instead the microphone can be returned to the manufacturer for service &amp; recalibration.</li><li>The stimulus and recording parameters described provide a reliable and time-efficient method to estimate ABR thresholds in a high-throughput phenotyping screen. The relatively low number of sweep records (256) contributing to each averaged waveform is made possible by minimizing sources of acoustic and electrical noise in the recording environment. Many other studies need to use many more sweeps (often &gt; 1000) to provide satisfactory waveforms. In this protocol, the stimuli are presented at the relatively fast rate of 42.6/s. This helps to desynchronize any potential noise from the 50 Hz mains electricity supply in the UK. Many other studies use a slower rate of presentation (&lt; 30/s). However, the higher stimulus presentation rate we use has a minimal effect on the recordings and facilitates a shorter time period before the mouse can be recovered from the anesthesia, thus helping to improve the welfare of the mice.</li><li>As no artifact rejection is used in the recording system, it is possible that the averaged trace can be significantly influenced by other electrical activity in the body. ECG activity can occasionally approach synchrony with the stimulus repetition rate. Muscle activity from the animalsâ breathing rhythm can affect the short snippets of activity recorded, as can prolonged (several seconds) bursts of muscle activity in lightly sedated animals. These can all introduce non-ABR noise/interference on the recorded traces. However, these are a relatively rare occurrence and if necessary, the affected stimulus frequency/level combinations can be repeated manually once the main automated data collection is complete.</li><li>This method has been developed for use with laboratory mice. With minor modification, it should be able to be used with most mammalian species; however this has not been tested. If attempting to record ABRs from other species, the experimenter should consider the hearing frequency range of that species and use a loudspeaker with an appropriate matching frequency range. The TDT RZ6-A-P1 Multi-IO processor can drive either magnetic loudspeakers (such as the TDT MF1 speaker) or, if responses to very high frequencies need to be examined, electrostatic speakers (such as TDT EC1 or ES1). <br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30516">### Recipes</p><p class="ppzz"><br/></p><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Ketamine/Xylazine anesthetic mix<br/>1 ml Ketamine HCl (Ketaset 100 mg/ml ketamine HCl, or equivalent)<br/>0.5 ml Xylazine HCl (Rompun, 20 mg/ml xylazine HCl)<br/>8.5 ml H<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>Atipamezole mix<br/>0.2 ml antisedan (Atipamezole hydrochloride 5 mg/ml, Pfizer)<br/>9.8 ml H<sub>2</sub>O</li></ol><p class="ppzz"><em>Note: Mixtures are stable at room temperature for long period.
