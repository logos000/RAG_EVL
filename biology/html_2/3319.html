            <h1>Image-based Quantification of Direct Cell-to-cell Transmission of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Fernando Merwaiss, Diego E. Alvarez</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Different viruses rely on direct cell-to-cell transmission to propagate infection within the infected host. Measuring this mode of transmission in cultured cells is often complicated by the contribution of cell free viruses to spread, and the difficulty to distinguish between primary infected cells that produce the virus and neighboring cells that are the target of spreading. Here, we present a protocol to quantify cell-to-cell transmission of the model pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus that is based on the co-culture of producer cells that are infected with a reporter virus expressing mCherry and target cells that stably express GFP. Spread of cell-free viruses is blocked by the presence of a neutralizing antibody in the cell culture medium, and cell-associated transmission is unequivocally quantified by numbering cells that are positive for both GFP and mCherry using automated analysis of fluorescence microscopy images. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The spread of virus infections relies both on the dissemination of free virus particles and direct cell-to-cell transmission. In an infected host, cell-associated transmission overcomes multiple barriers imposed to diffusion of free viruses, such as epithelial and mucosal barriers, or antibody neutralization (Sattentau, 2008; Mothes <em>et al.</em>, 2010). <em>In vitro</em>, spread of infection in the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies serves as a model to study direct cell-to-cell transmission. Virus spread from a producer cell to a target cell is usually studied in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Different protocols have been previously devised that measure foci size in non-dividing cell cultures (Barretto and Uprichard, 2014), that use a viral infection-activated split-intein-mediated reporter system to light the expression of fluorescent reporters of contrasting colors in co-cultured producer and target cells (Zhao <em>et al.</em>, 2018), or that require immunofluorescence staining of viral antigens in co-cultures where target cells express a fluorescent protein (Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2015). In addition, luciferase-based assays have been developed to measure cell-associated spread of HIV in co-cultures of cells expressing an HIV reporter genome and target CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Zhong <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Agosto <em>et al.</em>, 2014). We have recently shown that bovine viral diarrhea virus (a pestivirus in the family <em>Flaviviridae</em>) spreads by cell-to-cell transmission in cell culture using an approach that relies on the use of a co-culture of producer cells infected with a reporter bovine viral diarrhea virus expressing mCherry fluorescent protein, and target cells expressing GFP (Merwaiss <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In this setup, numbering cells positive for both mCherry and GFP scores virus transmission from producer to target cells. Quantification is performed by automated image analysis of fluorescence microscopy images, and spreading is expressed as the percentage of (mCherry and GFP positive cells)/(GFP positive cells). The protocol provides an unambiguous method to quantify virus spread and has the main advantages of not requiring immunofluorescence staining, and of relying only on the use of any susceptible cell line. In addition, it can be adapted to fully automated image acquisition and analysis, live cell imaging or flow cytometry setups.</p>

To establish cells persistently infected with the ncp virus, we prepare a 1:5 dilution of the stock in Infection medium. Spinoculation (see Supplemental Protocol Procedure A) can be used to favor infection. The establishment of persistently infected cells is independent of the multiplicity of infection, since cells are passaged until infection is detected in 80-100% of the cell monolayer.</em> </li><li>Add the 1 ml virus inoculum to MDBK cell culture and incubate for 2 h at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator to allow entry.</li><li>Remove the inoculum and add 2 ml of complete medium.</li><li>Incubate at 37 Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator until cells reach 100% confluency (usually 2-3 days).</li><li>Lift cells with trypsin and plate into a 100 mm tissue culture dish. </li><li>Split cells every 3-4 days and check the proportion of infected cells by scoring expression of mCherry through direct visualization of the plate under an inverted fluorescence microscope.

We usually use 10-fold above the 50% neutralizing dose to completely block the spread of cell free viruses.

For example, we generated in our study MDBK cells expressing dominant negative Eps15 fused to GFP to evaluate the dependence on clathrin-mediated endocytosis for BVDV spread into target cells (Merwaiss <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Factors with bona fide loss of function mutations such as Caveolin, Dynamin, Rab5, and Rab7 can be evaluated using this setup. This protocol is also compatible with target cells depleted of host factors. <br/><br/></li></ol><p class="ppzz"><strong><span style="font-size:20px;">Supplemental protocol: Quantification of cell-to-cell spread using cytopathic BVDV/mCherry-E2</span></strong> </p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti_no">##  Materials and Reagents </p><p class="ppzz">The same as in the Main Protocol with the following addition: cpBVDV/mCherry-E2 generated using a reverse genetic system as previously described (Merwaiss <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28624">### Equipment</p><p class="ppzz">The same as in the Main Protocol with the following addition: Thermo Scientific SL 16 benchtop centrifuge with M-20 microplate swinging bucket rotor.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28625">### Software</p><p class="ppzz">The same as in the Main Protocol.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28626">### Procedure</p><ol class="npwone"><li>Infection of MDBK cells with cytopathic BVDV (Figure 2)<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Seed 3 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well on 12 mm glass coverslips in 500 Î¼l of complete medium in 24-well plates and allow to grow overnight in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator. </li><li>On the following day, prepare a dilution of cpBVDV/mCherry-E2 to 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml in infection medium.</li><li>Wash cells and add 200 Î¼l of virus dilution per well.<br/></li><li>Spinoculate the cells by centrifuging the plate at 500 <em>x g</em> for 10 min.</li><li>Move the plate to 37 Â°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator for 4 h.

False positive cells (target cells that are not infected) should not exceed 10% of the double positive cells in a given image. A non-spreading phenotype is usually an excellent control to test if threshold settings are adequate. We allow a maximum of 3% double positive cells (false positive) for non-spreading phenotypes.
