            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>T follicular helper (Tfh) cells regulate B cell selection for entry into the germinal center (GC) reaction or for differentiation into antibody forming cells. This process takes place at the border between the T and B zones in lymphoid organs and involves physical contacts between T and B cells. During these interactions, T cells endow the B cells with selection signals that promote GC seeding or plasmablast differentiation based on their B cell receptor affinity. In Peyerâs patches (PPs), T cells promote B cell colonization of the subepithelial dome (SED) without effective affinity-based clonal selection. To specifically characterize the T cell population that resides within the SED niche, we performed <em>ex vivo</em> photoactivation of the SED compartment followed by flow cytometry analysis of the labeled cells, as described in this protocol. This technique integrates both spatial and cellular information in studies of immunological niches and can be adapted to various experimental systems.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Affinity maturation, the process wherein the affinity of serum antibodies towards a specific antigen increases over time, is achieved by selection of B cells bearing high affinity BCRs within germinal centers (GCs). Increase in antibody affinity is mediated through iterative cycles of somatic hyper mutation and affinity-based selection, a process which is orchestrated by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (Kepler and Perelson, 1993; Oprea and Perelson, 1997; Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012). The GC is comprised of two microanatomical sites; the dark zone, where B cells proliferate and acquire somatic hypermutations, and the light zone, where B cells interact with cognate antigen and T cells. Although intravital imaging techniques were able to define immune cell dynamics in GCs (Allen <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Hauser <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Schwickert <em>et al.</em>, 2007), transition between the GC zones remained in question. This problem was later solved by the generation of mice expressing photoactivatable GFP (PA-GFP) (Victora <em>et al.</em>, 2010).<br/> <br/>PA-GFP is a GFP variant whose peak excitation wavelength shifts from 415 nm (inactive PA-GFP) to 495 nm (active PA-GFP) upon two-photon irradiation at 830 nm. The non-activated PA-GFP is fluorescent as well, and this property can be used to distinguish between the photoactivated area and the total cells (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002).<br/> <br/>The use of mice expressing PA-GFP provided direct evidence for interzonal migration in the GC and for the definition of the major GC exit zone (Victora <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Stoler-Barak <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Combination of intravital two-photon laser scanning microscopy with in situ photoactivation, allowed the microanatomical labeling of distinct niches within the germinal center, and led to the discovery that T cell help controls the movement between the two GC zones (Victora <em>et al.</em>, 2010).<br/> <br/>Cell-surface markers are commonly used to define a cell population in a specific niche; however, distinctive markers are not always available, generating a gap between the cellular and spatial information in the studied tissue. Furthermore, unknown cell populations that reside within a specific niche are usually hard to detect and characterize by conventional techniques. To overcome these limitations, photoactivation-based approaches have been used for unbiased identification of tissue-resident immune cells with minimal a priori knowledge of unique cell-surface marker expression. Niche-specific landmarks are often introduced into mice prior to labeling by photoactivation to define the area of interest. For example, adoptive cell transfer of fluorescently labeled B cells mark the B cell area within a tissue and can guide the selection of the region of interest for photoactivation (Medaglia <em>et al.</em>, 2017). In the study associated with this protocol and as described here, we specifically photoactivated the subepithelial dome niche within the Peyerâs patch (Biram <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This protocol can be adapted to other niches and additional tissues of interest.</p>

Longer delay in tissue processing might increase the frequency of dead cells and therefore will not contribute to pool of analyzed cells. In the case of the SED photoactivation, ~30 SED regions were photoactivated in each mouse and up to two mice were analyzed a day. In addition, photoactivation can be held on the full PA-GFP mouse, on transferred cells or in chimeras prepared with PA-GFP bone marrow. Heterozygous PA-GFP mice can also be used in this protocol, but homozygous PA-GFP mice generate a stronger GFP signal. In the study associated with this protocol, we generated chimeric mice composed of 90% homozygous PA-GFP bone marrow and 10% AID-GFP bone marrow. AID is expressed by SED and GC B cells, thus AID-GFP was used as a landmark for these compartment.<br/><br/></em> </p><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Euthanize a mouse by cervical dislocation or by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation (the technique does not affect the following steps).</li><li>Open the abdominal cavity and remove the small intestine from the cecum to stomach into a PBS containing petri dish (~15 ml of PBS).</li><li>Flush the intestine with 40 ml PBS using a 30 ml syringe with an 18 G Monoject<sup>TM</sup> blunted cannula.
