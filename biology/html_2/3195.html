            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Microfluidic devices have become an integral method of cardiovascular research as they enable the study of shear force in biological processes, such as platelet function and thrombus formation. Furthermore, microfluidic chips offer the benefits of <em>ex vivo</em> testing of platelet adhesion using small amounts of blood or purified platelets. Microfluidic chips comprise flow channels of varying dimensions and geometries which are connected to a syringe pump. The pump draws blood or platelet suspensions through the channel(s) allowing for imaging of platelet adhesion and thrombus formation by fluorescence microscopy. The chips can be fabricated from various blood-compatible materials. The current protocol uses commercial plastic or in-house polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chips. Commercial biochips offer the advantage of standardization whereas in-house chips offer the advantage of decreased cost and flexibility in design. Microfluidic devices are a powerful tool to study the biorheology of platelets and other cell types with the potential of a diagnostic and monitoring tool for cardiovascular diseases.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Platelets primary function is to maintain blood in circulation by sealing off any breach of vessel integrity which would otherwise lead to exsanguination. For this function, platelets have evolved specialized cell surface receptors to allow adhesion to the endothelium and subendothelium at varying shear rates, ranging from 200 s<sup>-1</sup> in venous circulation to &gt; 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> in stenotic arteries (Chatzizisis <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Shear stress is implicated in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (Chatzizisis <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Shear rate and stress impact protein expression (Morigi <em>et al.</em>, 1995) and function (Yago <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Ju <em>et al.</em>, 2013 and 2015). Hence, the effect of flow on cell function must be included in vascular research.<br/><br/>Flow chambers, introduced in 1973 by Baumgartner (Baumgartner, 1973), incorporate the parameters of shear rate, which is the velocity gradient throughout a moving fluid, and shear stress, which is the force experienced by the wall of a conductance vessel due to the friction force of a moving fluid. The application of microfluidics has enabled significant discoveries in platelet biology. For example, by perfusing blood under controlled shear rates over adhesive proteins, it was found that platelets utilize their receptor glycoprotein Ib alpha (GPIbÎ±) to adhere to von Willebrand factor (vWF), whereas, they use their receptor integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (Î±<sub>IIb</sub>Î²<sub>3</sub>) to adhere to fibrinogen (Ruggeri, 2009; Ju <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Passam <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Under low-intermediate shear rates (&lt; 1 x 10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), typically found in veins and large arteries, platelet adhesion is predominately mediated by integrin Î±<sub>IIb</sub>Î²<sub>3</sub>. Under high shear rates (1 x 10<sup>3</sup>-1 x 10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), typically found in arterial microcirculation and in arterial stenosis, platelet adhesion is predominantly vWF-dependent (Reininger <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Ruggeri <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Jackson, 2007). Because of the effect of fluid dynamics on cell function and protein expression, microfluidics is a powerful tool to study cells in circulation.<br/><br/>Commercial microfluidic devices have been developed. The rheology of biological fluids passing through these devices has been well characterized (Lane <em>et al.</em>, 2012). However, these devices are limited by high cost and inflexible geometry designs. Recent studies in the field have utilized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers to fabricate microfluidic flow chambers, or âbiochipsâ, with typical channel geometries of 10-1,000 Î¼m in x and y-axes and 10-200 Î¼m in the z-axis. PDMS is a transparent and elastic material which has been widely used to create microfluidic channels with various geometries such as stenosis (Nesbitt <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Tovar-Lopez <em>et al.</em>, 2013), bifurcation (Tsai <em>et al.</em>, 2012), aneurysm (Mannino <em>et al.</em>, 2015), and spiral channels for two-dimensional cell sorting (Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2016). In contrast to the conventional flow chamber that usually requires milli-liter sample volumes, the microfluidic biochip only requires micro-liter samples, making it a perfect analytical tool for small volumes (<em>e.g.</em>, pediatric or rare samples and mouse studies). In addition, the biochips described in this protocol are reusable, making them an economic and versatile choice for microfluidic studies. <br/><br/>Using microfluidics, we have recently shown that a member of the thiol isomerase family, endoplasmic reticulum protein 5 (ERp5) regulates platelet adhesion to fibrinogen in a shear-dependent manner (Passam <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The current protocol describes the fabrication and assembly of an in-house straight-channel biochip. The protocol also describes the application of straight-channel commercial and in-house chips for the study of platelet adhesion under controlled shear conditions.<br/></p>

Most universities and institutes have photolithography and clean room facilities for the fabrication of the master mould. In this protocol, the photolithography is conducted at <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/research-and-prototype-foundry.html" target="_blank">the Research and Prototype Foundry at University of Sydney Nano Institute</a>. It is possible to perform photolithography without a foundry. The equipment required would include: 1. Air plasma system, 2. Oven for PDMS curing, 3. Desiccator for PDMS degassing, 4. Programmable spin coater, 5. UV lampâLED exposure, 6. Programmable hot plate.

The ramping profile is achieved by proximity, plus vacuum contact bake steps, for a total duration of 805 s.</li><li>Allow the film to cool on the hotplate to room temperature. <br/><em>Note: Keep the film on the hotplate to avoid thermal stress.</em> </li><li>Develop unexposed SU-8 photoresist using fresh developer solution for 3.5 min in a rocker.</li><li>Rinse the wafer with IPA. </li><li>Dry the wafer using pressurized nitrogen. </li><li>Hard-bake the wafer at 150 Â°C for 30 min. <br/><em>Note: Alternatively, follow </em><a href="http://microchem.com/pdf/SU-82000DataSheet2025thru2075Ver4.pdf." target="_blank"><em>the Permanent Epoxy Negative Photoresist Processing Guidline</em></a><em> from MicroChem.</em><br/><br/></li></ol><em>Note: The following Steps (A11-A17) can be performed in the research lab (these steps do not require a clean room).</em> <em>(Figure 1)</em> <ol class="npwtwo" start="11"><li>Transfer the silicon wafer into a 150 mm Petri dish, SU-8 side facing upwards, and secure with scotch tape.</li><li>Mix the Sylgard 184 kit PDMS base with the kit curing agent at a ratio of 10:1 by weight. For example, to prepare 198 g of PDMS, mix 180 g of the PDMS base with 18 g of the curing agent.<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>Due to the viscosity of the base and curing agent, it is easier to prepare the kit by weight. It is important that the base and curing agent are mixed completely to prevent inconsistencies in the curing of the final product. Mix thoroughly until no visible streaks can be seen. This process will create a large amount of small bubbles that need to be removed by degassing.</em> </li><li><em>Once the curing agent is added to the PDMS base, the PDMS will slowly begin to cure and harden at room temperature. This will be noticeable after 4 h. After 16 h, the PDMS will become too viscous to practically work with.</em> </li></ol></li><li>Pour the PDMS mixture over the pre-made mold, creating a 4-5 mm thick film.</li><li>Place the PDMS and mold in a Nalgene<sup>Â®</sup> vacuum desiccator and degas for 30 min.<br/><em>Note: The amount of time required to degas the mixture is dependent on the volume and surface area of PDMS. The mixture must be degassed completely, otherwise bubbles will form during the curing process which will change the morphology of the device. For 200 g of PDMS placed in a 100 mm diameter Petri dish, 2 h is sufficient to completely degas the mixture.</em> </li><li>Bake (cure) the PDMS mixture and mold in the oven at 80 Â°C for 4 h.</li><li>Cut out the cured PDMS chips from the mold gently and carefully.<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>For the design used in this protocol, the biochip can be cut from the mold and the remaining PDMS can be left on the mold to reduce the amount of PDMS required for fabrication in the future.</em> </li><li><em>The typical PDMS cut-out block has a length of 4 cm, width of 2 cm and height of 5 mm. Avoid larger PDMS cut-outs as these can bend the coverslip and obscure the plane of focus during image acquisition.</em> </li><li><em>Take care not to damage or crack the mold whilst cutting out the biochip. Gradually cut out the PDMS by making consecutive, linear cuts into the PDMS and gently lift the PDMS off from the silicon wafer.</em> </li></ol></li><li>With the channel side facing upward, use a 6 mm diameter biopsy punch to cut out a hole at one end of the channel. Punch another hole at the opposite end of the channel using a 1 mm diameter biopsy punch.<br/><em>Note: The 6 mm hole is used as a well to hold the sample for the microfluidics experiment once the biochip is placed on a coverslip. The 1 mm hole is used to connect the channel to the syringe pump.</em><br/></li></ol><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="107" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190314/20190314010444_6689.jpg" width="145"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Fabrication of PDMS biochips.</strong> The PDMS biochip produced in this protocol features a 6 mm diameter inlet (well) which can hold up to 100 Î¼l of sample, and a 1 mm diameter outlet which connects the channel to the pump. The channel has a length of 12 mm, width of 0.4 mm and a height of 0.05 mm (A, B, and C). The manufactured silicon wafer mask contains indentations which form the shape of the channel (D).<br/><br/></li><li>Cleaning the biochip<br/>Dust and other impurities can affect the coating of coverslips with fibrinogen and obstruct the field of view under the microscope. Dust may also interfere with the adhesion of PDMS to the coverslip and the adhesion of platelets to the coated coverslip. The following is a gentle cleaning procedure to remove dust and impurities from the surface of PDMS and coverslips.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Place the biochip in 400 ml of 10% extran and sonicate for 15 min.</li><li>Blow dry the biochip completely using compressed air.<br/><em>Note: Make sure the biochip is completely dry before proceeding. Remnants from small droplets can compromise the contact between the biochip and the coverslip leading to leakage during a microfluidics experiment.</em> </li><li>Place the biochip in 100% Butan-1-ol and sonicate for 30 min.<br/><em>Note: The PDMS will swell slightly and show indentations after the Butan-1-ol treatment. This is normal and the PDMS will return to its original shape and size once sonicated in dH</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>O.</em> </li><li>Blow dry the biochip completely using compressed air. Place the biochip in 10% extran and sonicate for 10 min.</li><li>Blow dry the device using compressed air. Place the biochip in dH<sub>2</sub>O and sonicate for 10 min.</li><li>Blow dry the device using compressed air.</li><li>With the channel side facing down, place the biochip on a #1 coverslip. Press the PDMS down on the coverslip with the palm of your hand and smooth out any bubbles with your finger.<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>A good seal needs to be made between the PDMS and the coverslip to prevent leakage of cells from the sides of the channel.</em> </li><li><em>The coverslip should be cleaned to remove any dust and smudges that may interfere with contact between the PDMS and the coverslip. The coverslip can be cleaned using Steps B1 and B5.</em> </li><li><em>The PDMS can be reused after the microfluidics experiment. Clean the PDMS again by following Procedure B. Store the PDMS in a sealed container away from light. The PDMS can be reused until it is permanently bent and does not stick properly to a coverslip. In our experience, the PDMS can be reused at least 10 times.</em> </li><li><em>The size of the coverslip used depends on the size of the biochip. Choose a coverslip size that is closest to the area of the biochip.</em><br/><br/></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Coating the channel of the biochip <br/>The steps involved in the coating of the biochip (Section C) can be found in Video 1.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Place 100 Î¼l of fibrinogen (40 Î¼g/ml final fibrinogen concentration in PBS, pH 7.4) in the 6 mm inlet of the biochip.</li><li>Using a 1.5 ml transfer pipette, draw the fibrinogen through the channel and into the pipette.<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>A good seal between the transfer pipette and the 1 mm outlet must be made, otherwise the fibrinogen will not transverse the channel properly. Bubbles in the pipette indicate that good suction was not achieved.</em> </li><li><em>Do not drain the inlet or the channel completely. Draw up enough of the fibrinogen solution until you are certain that the channel has been filled with the fibrinogen solution. To remove the pipette from the outlet, apply positive pressure on the transfer pipette until the fluid stops drawing into the pipette, then remove the pipette.</em> </li><li><em>To check that the channel has been filled with the coating substrate (fibrinogen), rotate the biochip back and forth under light. Due to the refractive index mismatch between air and PDMS, an empty channel will be slightly less transparent than a channel filled with fluid, leading to a shimmering of the channel under light.</em> </li></ol></li><li>Incubate the biochip for 2 h at 25 Â°C.<br/><em>Note: The incubation period and temperature will depend on the coating substrate used to coat the channel. However, the longer the channel is left incubating, the greater the risk of the channel leaking.</em> </li><li>Remove the fibrinogen in the inlet well, replace with 100 Î¼l of Tyrodeâs buffer or PBS and repeat Step D2 to wash the channel.</li><li>Remove the Tyrodeâs buffer or PBS from the inlet well and replace with 100 Î¼l of blocking buffer. Repeat Step D2 to block the channel with blocking buffer. Incubate for 30 min at 25 Â°C.</li><li>Remove the blocking buffer from the inlet well, replace with 100 Î¼l of Tyrodeâs buffer or PBS and repeat Step D2 to wash the channel.<br/><em>Note: Once washed, keep the Tyrodeâs buffer or PBS in the channel until image acquisition. This will prevent the formation of air bubbles in the channel while flowing cells through the biochip.</em><br/><br/><!--video3195-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3195-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3195-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3195/3195-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.
