            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Using animal models in addiction and pain research is pivotal to unravel new pathways and mechanisms for the treatment of these disorders. Reward devaluation through a consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC) task has shown the ability to reduce physical pain sensitivity (hypoalgesia) and increase oral ethanol consumption in rats. The procedure is based on exposing the experimental animals to a 32% sucrose solution during several sessions (preshift sessions) followed by a devaluation to 4% sucrose during the next few sessions (postshift sessions). The cSNC effect can be monitored by comparing the experimental group to an unshifted control that had access to 4% sucrose throughout the entire experiment (preshift and postshift sessions). The cSNC phenomenon is defined by lower consumption of sucrose in the downshifted group than in the unshifted group during postshfit sessions.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>There is experimental evidence that emotional states (<em>e.g.</em>, anxiety or frustration) influence sensitivity to physical pain and correlate with the consumption of psychoactive substances like alcohol (Wiech and Tracey, 2008; Xie <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Manzo <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Reward devaluation is a viable strategy to induce a negative emotion such as anxiety (see Flaherty, 1996; Papini <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Reward devaluation can be implemented in different procedures, including appetitive extinction, partial reinforcement, and successive negative contrast (SNC). All of them imply unexpected changes in reward magnitude or quality. In appetitive extinction, the reward is withheld altogether, while for partial reinforcement the reward is withheld on some random number of trials. SNC implies not the elimination, but a devaluation of the magnitude or quality of the reward. In the consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC) task, one type of SNC procedure, animals receive free access for 5 min to a high-value sucrose solution (usually 32% sucrose) during several daily sessions, followed by several sessions of access to a low-value sucrose solution (usually 4% sucrose) (JimÃ©nez-GarcÃ­a <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Performance of downshifted animals is compared to the consummatory behavior of animals that have always received access to 4% sucrose (unshifted controls). The cSNC effect involves a suppression of consummatory behavior after the 32%-4% sucrose downshift followed by a recovery to the level of unshifted controls. The initial suppression (typically observed during the first devaluation session) and the recovery that follows (normally starting during the second devaluation session) are dissociable stages of the cSNC effect (Flaherty, 1996). <br/><br/>Several sources of evidence suggest that cSNC modulates and is also modulated by physical pain (JimÃ©nez-GarcÃ­a <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Papini <em>et al.</em> (2015) suggested a connection between physical pain (tissue damage) and psychological pain (reward loss) that invites further comparisons between these two sets of phenomena. For example, opioid ligands known to modulate physical pain also modulate cSNC, either during the first downshift session ([D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin, a selective delta-receptor agonist; Wood <em>et al.</em>, 2005), during the second downshift session (U50,488H, a selective kappa-receptor agonist; Wood <em>et al.</em>, 2008), or during both sessions (morphine; Rowan and Flaherty, 1987). Two opioid-receptor antagonists enhance the cSNC effect either selectively during the first downshift session (naltrindole, a selective delta receptor antagonist) or during both the first and second downshift sessions (naloxone, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist; Pellegrini <em>et al.</em>, 2005). Similarly, lesions of brain areas involved in pain processing, such as the anterior cingulate cortex, also affect recovery from reward downshift from the second downshift session onward (Ortega <em>et al.</em>, 2011).<br/><br/>Likewise, ethanol consumption is increased by cSNC. Reward devaluation produces an anxious state (frustration) that can be mitigated by the anxiolytic effects of ethanol. Manzo <em>et al.</em> (2015) showed an increase in ethanol consumption after reward devaluation (post-shift sessions).<br/></p>

Deprive animals of food to 82%-85% of their ad lib weights throughout the experiment. Once animals reach the required weight, feed daily with 9 g (Â±1.5 g) of rat chow to maintain body weight. All manipulations must be carried out at the same time every day and preferably by the same person. Efforts must be made to minimize suffering and reduce the number of animals used in the experiments. To maintain the animalâs body weight as assessed before the start of the experiment, it is important to weigh each specimen every day and provide supplementary food no less than 30 min after the end of each session. Moreover, sucrose solution must be prepared fresh daily to avoid contamination. </li><li>cSNC training lasts 19 daily sessions: 16 preshift sessions followed by 3 postshift sessions. </li><li>In the cSNC task, at least two experimental groups are required. During the preshift sessions, one of them has access to a large reward (<em>e.g.</em>, 32% sucrose solution) and the other to a small reward (<em>e.g.</em>, 4% sucrose solution).

Itâs necessary to cover the boxesâ floor with standard home cage sawdust. No access to food or water should be allowed.</li><li>For the sucrose presentation, a graduated cylinder (in 0.01 ml units) with a metallic sipper tube can be used.</li><li>cSNC training can be reduced to 15 daily sessions: 10 preshift sessions followed by 5 postshift sessions. This procedure is the typical protocol in cSNC experiments and, for that reason, it is advantageous too. Some experiments have reported a cSNC effect with minimal preshift experience (one session: Flaherty <em>et al.</em>, 1983), but less than 10 preshift sessions is infrequently used. The final protocol chosen will depend on other requirements associated with the problem of interest.</li><li>A recording system (<em>i.e.</em>, camera) could be used optionally. Thus, place the recording system on the side of the chamber. Ensure that the oral region of the animal is clearly visible.</li><li>A magnetic stirrer may be useful to properly dissolve sucrose.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27408">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>32% sucrose solution<br/>32 g sucrose (commercial white sugar)<br/>68 g distilled water</li><li>4% sucrose solution<br/>4 g sucrose (commercial white sugar)<br/>96 g distilled water<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27409">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This paper was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (grant PSI-2013-44945-P), the Junta de AndalucÃ­a (grant CTS109), FEDER funds and the Masterâs program in Basic and Applied Neuroscience and Pain, University of Granada, Spain.
