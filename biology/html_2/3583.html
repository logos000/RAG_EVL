            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Asthma is a global problem that affects millions of individuals. An increased risk of respiratory viral and bacterial infections is one of the complications of asthma. We recently reported that mice with ovalbumin-induced allergic airway disease (AAD) are protected against influenza-<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>co-infection. Here, we describe in detail a protocol on how to induce AAD and influenza-<em>S. pneumoniae</em> co-infection in mice and to evaluate the specific roles of asthma on immunity to viral and bacterial pathogens in the hope of translating findings to benefit asthmatic individuals.</p>
            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Asthma, Allergic airway disease, Influenza, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, Co-infection</p>
            <h2>Background</h2><p>The global prevalence of individuals with asthma is increasing, with 300 million presently suffering and an additional 100 million new incidences predicted by 2025 (Nunes<em> et al.</em>, 2017). Because of the altered immune system, asthmatic individuals are believed to have an increased risk of susceptibility to influenza infection. Seasonal and pandemic influenza infection can result in concurrent bacterial infection which can lead to airway respiratory distress syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition (Gilca <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Whether or not asthmatics are more susceptible and have reduced protective anti-influenza immune responses, is controversial. During the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic, asthmatics were more likely to be hospitalized due to influenza. However, clinical data also suggest that asthmatics were less likely to die or require ICU admission than those without asthma. The majority of deaths during influenza pandemics are not caused by the viral infection per se, but instead, are due to complications from secondary bacterial infections (Morens <em>et al.</em>, 2008; MacIntyre <em>et al.</em>, 2018). We previously reported that mice with AAD are resistant to a single infection with influenza virus or<em> S. pneumoniae</em> (Furuya<em> et al.</em>, 2015; Sanfilippo <em>et al.</em>, 2015). However, there was no murine model that addressed the influence of allergic airway disease (AAD) on immunity to influenza virus and bacterial co-infection. Thus, we have developed a triple challenge model in mice to test the hypothesis that asthmatics are protected from severe influenza because they are less likely to develop severe secondary bacterial pneumonia (Roberts<em> et al.</em>, 2019).</p>
