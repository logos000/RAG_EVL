            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p> Cleavable Affinity Purification (Cl-AP) uses a tripartite system of Protein-A-Streptavidin beads and nanobodies, coupled with a biotinylated, thiol-cleavable linker, providing one-step affinity purification from lysates of tissues expressing tagged proteins. This technique allows fluorescent versions of mitotic protein complexes to be isolated intact from cells, for use in biophysical and microscopy-based assays, overcoming the traditional limitations of reductionist approaches. We have used this technique successfully to purify both GFP-tagged and mCherry-tagged proteins, and their interacting partners, expressed in <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> embryos. Although we demonstrate the efficacy of the GFP-binding protein and RFP-binding protein nanobodies from Chromotek, in theory any antibody could be coupled to the beads and used as a Cl-AP reagent.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Many proteins elicit their cellular function as part of multi-protein complexes. In order to gain full understanding of the role of a protein complex, <em>in vivo</em> approaches such as perturbation of protein levels/activity or monitoring dynamic localization need to be combined with <em>in vitro</em> biochemical assays and functional reconstitution. This holistic approach is currently severely limited. <em>In vitro</em> studies generally use proteins that have been individually expressed and purified in non-autogenous systems such as bacteria and insect cells, where folding and post translational modifications crucial to function may be dissimilar to that found in the original cell. Conversely, purification of specific proteins or complexes from cells/tissues generally relies on either co-immuno-precipitation or purification of a tagged version of the protein of interest which has been introduced into cells, for example using haemagglutinin (HA), FLAG<sup>3</sup> or tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagging. There are two main issues with these <em>in vivo</em> approaches: (i) the beads themselves bind to non-specific proteins leading to contamination problems, (ii) the strong antibody-antigen or tag-matrix interaction cannot be disrupted without disrupting the interactions between protein complex subunits. Modified protocols, in which the antibody-antigen interactions are disrupted using peptide competition or in which the tag is cleaved using proteases can potentially result in the purification of soluble, intact protein complex from cells. However, the former requires extensive knowledge of the antibody-antigen interface while both procedures are undertaken in non-physiological conditions and result in protein complex that requires further purification (separating the excess peptide or the protease respectively), complicating this type of approach.<br/><br/>We sought to develop a quick, easy and widely applicable technique that would solve these problemsâallowing the isolation of a protein complex of interest in soluble form, in the buffer of choice. We chose GFP as our affinity tag, given the added advantage of being able to assess the dynamic localization and functionality of the fusion protein within a cell or tissue, prior to isolation. We term this technique Cleavable Affinity Purification (Cl-AP).<br/></p>
