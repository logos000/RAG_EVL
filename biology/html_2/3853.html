            <h1>Preparation of Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles for Characterisation of Periplasmic Proteins in Their Native Environment</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johannes Thoma, BjÃ¶rn M. Burmann</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are naturally formed by budding from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. OMVs consist of a lipid bilayer identical in composition to the original outer membrane and contain periplasmic content within their lumen. Enriched with specific envelope proteins, OMVs make for an excellent native-like platform to study these proteins <em>in-situ</em> using biophysical methods. Here, we describe in detail the preparation of OMVs from <em>Escherichia coli</em>, which are luminally enriched with periplasmic proteins and uniformly labeled with stable isotopes (<sup>2</sup>H and <sup>15</sup>N), suitable for the subsequent characterisation of proteins at atomic resolution in their native environment by solution-state NMR spectroscopy. The ability to perform structural studies of periplasmic components <em>in-situ</em> clears the way to reaching an in-depth understanding of the functional and mechanistic details of this unique cellular compartment.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>The periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria is a quite remarkable cellular compartment. This space, incarcerated between the inner and outer bacterial membrane, contains proteins at an extraordinarily high concentration exceeding 300 mg ml<sup>−1 </sup>(Oliver, 1996) and, in the absence of cellular sources such as ATP, functions almost energetically independent from its cytosolic counterpart. So far, structural knowledge about periplasmic proteins has been exclusively obtained using purified proteins isolated from their native environment. Thus, any structural and functional influence this special environment might impose on a protein are lost during purification. Efforts to study periplasmic proteins <em>in-situ</em> using biophysical methods such as <em>in-cell</em> NMR spectroscopy have been hampered by the low volume ratio of the periplasm, which contributes only 5-10% to the total bacterial volume (Brass <em>et al.</em>, 1986).<br/></p><p> <br/>We recently described a new method to characterize proteins within bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) using solution-state NMR spectroscopy (Thoma and Burmann, 2020). OMVs, which are naturally released by Gram-negative bacteria, contain periplasmic content in their lumen and can be non-destructively purified from bacterial growth cultures (Chutkan <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Schwechheimer and Kuehn, 2015). Thus, OMVs represent an excellent platform to study periplasmic proteins, enriched in the luminal space, together with their natural environment. To be amendable for NMR studies, OMVs are uniformly labeled with stable isotopes (<sup>2</sup>H and <sup>15</sup>N) and prepared in large quantities. Our approach proved particularly useful for the study of soluble periplasmic proteins within this environment, as the membrane components of OMVs remain largely invisible to solution-state NMR, due to slower molecular tumbling rates.<br/></p><p><br/>One key factor for obtaining large amounts of luminally enriched OMVs is the use of a suitable expression strain. Widely used expression hosts such as <em>E. coli</em> BL21(DE3) do not produce sufficient amounts of OMVs to be feasible for these types of experiments (Thoma <em>et al.</em>, 2018). In contrast, strains lacking the major outer membrane protein OmpA have been shown to have a 26-fold increased OMV production (Schwechheimer <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Moreover, deletion of OmpA omits possible background signals originating from its soluble peptidoglycan binding domain in NMR experiments (Thoma and Burmann, 2020). In our experimental set-up we relied on the strain BL21(DE3)ompA, which was kindly provided by Guido Grandi (Fantappiè <em>et al.</em>, 2014) and which reproducibly yielded high amounts of luminally enriched OMVs. However, other alternatives such as BL21A are available (Meuskens <em>et al.</em>, 2017) or could easily be tailor-made by deletion of the <em>ompA</em> gene in the expression strain of choice.<br/></p><p> <br/>Another critical factor for obtaining large amounts of suitable OMVs is the time point, at which the bacteria are removed from the growth media. Bacterial growth should be maintained as long as possible, since the amount of OMVs present in the culture supernatant correlates directly with the cell density and consequentially with the length of the growth period. However, OMVs should be collected before bacterial growth ceases and cultures enter the stationary phase, because this will substantially increase contaminations with cytoplasmic proteins, inner membranes, and cell debris resulting from stress-induced explosive cell lysis (Turnbull <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Thoma <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Depending on whether cells are grown in H<sub>2</sub>O or D<sub>2</sub>O based media this stage is typically achieved after 3 to 5 h, respectively. Since bacterial growth is not only retarded by the use of D<sub>2</sub>O but also underlies various influences such as the strain and plasmid used for expression, it is advisable to determine the growth behavior of the bacterial cultures prior to OMV preparation. Whereas deuteration is not strictly necessary for small to medium sized proteins (&lt; 25 kDa), luminally enriched OMVs prepared from cells grown in D<sub>2</sub>O based media typically yield NMR spectra of higher quality due to a decrease in background signals and a smaller NMR line-width (Thoma and Burmann, 2020).</p><br/></p>

However, UV-Vis spectra recorded of OMVs contain a strong light-scattering component. In order to estimate the protein concentration within an OMV sampleï¼ light-scattering due to the vesicles needs to be corrected. A light-scattering corrected UV-Vis spectrum can be obtained using the following equation, originally used to estimate the nucleic acid content of viruses (Porterfield and Zlotnick, 2010):</p><br/><p><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201215/20201215190604_5529.jpg" width="550"/> </p><br/><p>The total protein concentration in the OMV sample can be estimated from the corrected value of A<sub>280</sub>, assuming 1 Abs = 1 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> for the mixture of proteins present in OMVs. Due to the presence of nucleic acids in OMVs (Brown <em>et al.</em>, 2015), which strongly influences the absorbance at 280 nm, it is useful to estimate the amount of nucleic acids in the sample from the A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> ratio of the light-scattering corrected spectrum, which can be done using the following empirical equation (Glasel, 1995):</p><br/><p><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201215/20201215190759_4809.jpg" width="200"/> </p><br/><p>Typically, protein-enriched OMVs contain â¤ 3% nucleic acids. If nucleic acids are detected ([%N] &gt; 0)ï¼ the total protein concentration in the OMV sample can be estimated from the corrected values of A<sub>280</sub> and A<sub>260</sub>, using the following equation (Layne, 1957):</p><br/><p><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201215/20201215190900_3234.jpg" width="200"/> </p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti39227">### Notes</p><p>Typically a sufficient amount of enriched OMVs can be obtained from a growth culture volume of one liter using the culture conditions described above. Nevertheless, it should be noted that bacterial growth in D<sub>2</sub>O based media can be less reproducible than in H<sub>2</sub>O based media, occasionally resulting in irregular growth behavior and/or lower yields. Moreover, it should be noted that the overexpression of proteins in the periplasmic space can result in cytotoxicity (Schlegel <em>et al.</em>, 2013), which might require specific adaption of the induction levels to the expression system used.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti39228">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>LB-medium (Lennox)</p><p>10 g/L Tryptone</p><p>5 g/L Yeast extract</p><p>5 g/L NaCl</p><p>Dissolve in H<sub>2</sub>O and sterilize by autoclaving</p></li><li><p>M9 medium</p><p>6 g/L Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> </p><p>3 g/L KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> </p><p>1 g/L <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl</p><p>0.5 g/L NaCl</p><p>2 g/L D-Glucose</p><p>1 ml/L CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.1 M) solution*</p><p>1 ml/L MgSO<sub>4</sub> (1 M) solution*</p><p>0.1 ml/L Thiamine (10 mg/ml) solution*</p><p>Dissolve solid components in H<sub>2</sub>O/D<sub>2</sub>O, add salt/Thiamine solutions and sterilize by filtration using 0.22 Âµm vacuum filtration units.</p><p>*<em>Note: Prepare stock solutions in H<sub>2</sub>O/D<sub>2</sub>O, respectively.</em> </p></li><li><p>Dulbeccos phosphate buffered saline with added salts (DPBSS)/NMR sample buffer:</p><p>1.15 g/L Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> </p><p>0.2 g/L KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> </p><p>8 g/L NaCl</p><p>0.2 g/L KCl</p><p>0.45 ml/L CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1 M) solution</p><p>0.25 ml/L MgCl<sub>2</sub> (1 M) solution</p><p>Dissolve solid components in H<sub>2</sub>O*, add salt solutions and sterilize by filtration using 0.22 Âµm vacuum filtration units.</p><p>*<em>Note: For NMR sample buffer, dissolve in H<sub>2</sub>O to 90% final volume, then add 10% D<sub>2</sub>O.</em> </p></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti39229">### Acknowledgments</p><p>We thank G.
