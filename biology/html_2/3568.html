            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Despite the great number of test batteries already known to assess the behavior of genetically modified and inbred strains of mice, only a few of them focus on basic neurological parameters. The purpose of the battery test proposed is to settle a specific methodology to characterize the phenotype of neurological disease models in mutant or genetically modified mice. This methodology is simple and efficient in order to analyze several parameters, including general activity, sensory nervous system, sensorimotor system, central nervous system and autonomous nervous system. This can aid the choice of specific additional tests as well as the determination of an interrelationship among phenotypic alterations observed. Although being efficient for a first analysis of a mouse model, interpretation of the results must be carefully made because phenotype manifestation may vary due to many parameters, including mouse strain, environmental and housing condition, animal-experimenter interaction, sample size and tests order. It is important to consider as a critical point if handling procedures are aversive. The results acquired with the analysis of 18 parameters together provide preliminary data to characterize mouse phenotype and helps selecting more specific tests.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Laboratory mice have been used as models for biomedical studies, offering a variety of genetic models such as isogenic strains, spontaneous mutants and genetically modified animals. After the implementation of genetic modification, mice became an essential tool in neuroscience research, allowing researchers to investigate the role of individual genes on development and behavior. Furthermore, mice have been the main mammalian models and genetic organisms due to their 85% homology when compared to humans (Pritchett-Corning <em>et al.</em>, 2015), including similarities with the functionality of the human brain such as anxiety-like behavior and other emotional responses (Van Meer and Raber, 2005). Thus mice became an essential part of efforts in prevention and treatment of many diseases, but also to test toxicity and adverse effects of biological and chemical substances and in researching the efficacy and safety of new drugs (McLeod and Hartley, 2017).<br/> <br/>Mice behavior can be evaluated in several ways, including direct observation and a wide variety of behavioral tests comprising a single task or multiple tests, using or not automated behavioral response assessment (Wahlsten, 2011). The choice of tests applied in the course of an experiment is directly related to the question to be answered. A battery of tests is proposed to evaluate the basic motor and sensory functions. Some of the tests described in our protocol have been grounded on SHIRPA procedure (Rogers <em>et al.</em>, 1997) The open field test (OFT) can be used to evaluate general activity, but also parameters related to sensorimotor, autonomous and sensory nervous systems (Yamamoto <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Sensory information provided by the vestibular system is essential in spatial memory process (Manes <em>et al.</em>, 2019), sensorimotor activity can be defined as the relationship among sensory perception, movement, emotion and cognition (Iliadi <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Also, autonomic nervous system is responsible to maintain homeostasis in the organism (McCorry, 2007).<br/> <br/>Here, we aim to develop a specific methodology to evaluate behavioral parameters of laboratory mice in order to characterize the phenotype of neurological disease models in mutant or genetically modified mice and to evaluate the effects and toxicity of substances.</p>

Multifactorial interference should be taken in account, such as environmental and housing condition, animal-experimenter interaction, sample size and the order tests are conducted (HÃ¥nell and Marklund, 2014).</li><li>General activity can be remotely recorded, which enables automated analysis, but the other parameters require in spot evaluation.</li><li>Tests must be applied in the open field arena, rather than home cages, for two major reasons: first all animals are supposed to be exposed to the same unfamiliar environment (Whishaw <em>et al.</em>, 1999); second, several tests require handling and intervention, which is facilitated in an open field setup.</li><li>Normal exploratory behavior is measured by calculating horizontal locomotion and vertical activities, which is applied to assess basic motor information that along with other parameters, may provide a more accurate data about mouse phenotype.</li><li>Sensory nervous system evaluation is an important step to characterize genetically modiï¬ed or spontaneous mutant mice strains. Thus, the observation of sensory deficits might help to elucidate its development (HÃ¥nell and Marklund, 2014). Sensory parameters can be measured by animal reflexes and responses to specific stimuli related to body and proprioceptive senses, that evince evoked brain potentials (Sousa and Almeida, 2006).</li><li>In this protocol, sensory function is assessed by direct measurement of reflexes, such as response to auditory (auricular reflex), visual (corneal reflex) and somatosensory (response to touch and tail flick) stimuli. Sensorimotor system parametersâmuscle tone, hindquarter angulation, surface righting-reflex and grasp strengthâcan provide information about cerebellar function or asymmetrical brain function. However, grasp strength can also be influenced by body weight (Sousa and Almeida, 2006).<br/>Detecting sensory or sensorimotor deficits in a preliminary screen might support the choice of specific behavior tests, as animal physical disabilities are considered.</li><li>In general, more than one task can be selected to test a type of behavior relevant to a hypothesized function of a gene product (Crawley, 1999). An example of our approach is represented in the behavioral analyses of <em>crup</em> mutant mice, which presents remarkable reduction in general activity when compared to BALB/cJ mice. Sensorimotor impairment is indicated by lower scores in surface righting-reflex and grasp strength, and higher scores in hindquarter angulation compared to BALB/cJ. Regarding sensory function, <em>crup</em> showed decreased corneal reflex besides a reduction in urination and defecation, parameters linked to autonomic nervous system. This protocol allows an accurate and comprehensive behavioral analysis suggesting a degenerative process from a preliminary study in the recessive mutant strain <em>crup</em>. The current representative results show behavior genetics analyses that focus on the role of a mutant gene. The appropriate behavior response depends on reflex and sensory capabilities. The initial analysis can suggest indications for other tests that lead to true cognitive deficits (Sousa and Almeida, 2006) and can be expanded for further investigation.<br/>  A critical point when applying behavioral test batteries is the interference that the animal suffers if handling procedures are aversive. The testing sequence can attenuate such interference if those are taken following an increasing stress ladder. For example, first general activity is observed in the open field arena for environment habituation followed by observational parameters. Being the most stressful, interventional parameters must be the last to be observed, thus stress from one test will not interfere on the following test response.<br/>  This protocol addresses the analysis of 18 parameters together that provides preliminary data to characterize mouse phenotype and helps in choosing more specific tests. Although some of these tasks have already been described separately, here they were presented as a test battery. The following advantages are highlighted: inexpensive; quick and easy-to-perform protocols; combined parameters designed to cover a large number of behaviors displayed by animals; leads to a behavioral fingerprint for a vast range of disabilities.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32524">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This protocol is based upon work supported by FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo (FAPESP) under grant number 2017/21103-3, and CoordenaÃ§Ã£o de AperfeiÃ§oamento de Pessoal de NÃ­vel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001.
