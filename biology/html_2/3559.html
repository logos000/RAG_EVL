            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In diseases such as glaucoma, the failure of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons to survive or regenerate their optic nerve axons underlies partial and, in some cases, complete vision loss. Optic nerve crush (ONC) serves as a useful model not only of traumatic optic neuropathy but also of glaucomatous injury, as it similarly induces RGC cell death and degeneration. Intravitreal injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) has been shown to specifically and efficiently transduce RGCs <em>in vivo</em> and has thus been proposed as an effective means of gene delivery for the treatment of glaucoma. Indeed, we and others routinely use AAV2 to study the mechanisms that promote neuroprotection and axon regeneration in RGCs following ONC. Herein, we describe a step-by-step protocol to assay RGC survival and regeneration in mice following AAV2-mediated transduction and ONC injury including 1) intravitreal injection of AAV2 viral vectors, 2) optic nerve crush, 3) cholera-toxin B (CTB) labeling of regenerating axons, 4) optic nerve clearing, 5) flat mount retina immunostaining, and 6) quantification of RGC survival and regeneration. In addition to providing all the materials and procedural details necessary to execute this protocol, we highlight its advantages over other similar published approaches and include useful tips to ensure its faithful reproduction in any modern laboratory.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide characterized by the progressive degeneration and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the central projecting neurons that form the optic nerve connecting the retina to the brain (Quigley, 2011; Tham <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Glaucomatous RGC cell death is thought to be induced, in part, by an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) and concomitant compression of RGC axons as they exit the retina through the optic nerve head (Quigley, 2011; Chang and Goldberg, 2012). Several models of glaucoma in rodents have been developed to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie RGC degeneration including optic nerve crush (ONC), intracameral injection of microbeads, and intravitreal injection of silicon oil (Sappington <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Tang <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Templeton and Geisert, 2012; Ito <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2019). While both the microbead and silicon injection models recapitulate the increase in IOP and induce progressive RGC cell death associated with glaucoma, they are not conducive to study axon regeneration due to variability of the insult and incomplete degeneration of RGC axons. Alternatively, ONC has served as a useful preclinical model to study both neuronal survival and regeneration as it induces significant RGC death with little variability and severs all axons allowing confidence that any fibers found past the site of injury are regenerating, rather than spared. Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) specifically and efficiently transduces RGCs following intravitreal injection, making it the principal means to deliver genes (recombinant DNA, shRNA, <em>etc.</em>) into RGCs (Martin <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Nickells <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Indeed, weâve reported the use of AAV2 to deliver therapeutic peptides and shRNA to promote RGC survival and axon regeneration following ONC injury (Moore <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Apara <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Galvao <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Boczek <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Here, we describe a comprehensive protocol detailing the use of AAV2 in combination with ONC as a means to study the mechanisms that promote neuroprotection and regeneration, and to identify and characterize candidate molecules with therapeutic potential for the treatment of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.</p>
