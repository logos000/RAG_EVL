            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Habituation is the process whereby perceptual changes alter the value of environmental stimuli, enabling salience filtering. This behavioral response decrement is a form of non-associative learning, where the subject learns about the stimulus and does not involve sensory adaptation, sensory or motor fatigue. The range of behavioral responses in <em>D. melanogaster</em> led to the development of a number of habituation paradigms addressing various sensory modalities. Habituation of osmotactic responses has previously been measured with the Y-maze test and required 30 min of odor exposure. Here, we describe an olfactory habituation assay utilizing the widely used in associative learning paradigms T-maze. Continuous or repetitive odor exposure for 4 min is adequate to attenuate osmotactic responses both to attractive and aversive odors. Importantly, the decreased response conforms to habitation parameters, presenting dishabituation and spontaneous recovery. This assay allows the study of habituation after brief odor exposure, but also discriminates between the two distinct phases of the response, an initial habituation latency period followed by habituation. In addition, the characterization of the neuronal circuits implicated in each phase facilitates further study of the molecular components underlying this process.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Habituation, the behavioral modification whereby responses to repeated inconsequential stimuli are attenuated, is highly conserved and has been studied in a wide range of species, from Aplysia to humans. In <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, various paradigms have been developed to study habituation to visual, mechanical, gustatory, and olfactory stimuli. The variety of fly responses to odor stimulation led to development of different habituation paradigms, including olfactory jump response habituation (Mihalek <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Asztalos <em>et al.</em>, 2007a and 2007b; Joiner <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Sharma <em>et al.</em>, 2009), olfactory startle response habituation (Cho <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Wolf <em>et al.</em>, 2007), unconditioned leg movement habituation (Chandra and Singh, 2005), and olfactory avoidance habituation (Das <em>et al.</em>, 2011).<br/> <br/>Previous studies on olfactory avoidance habituation demonstrated that exposure to a continuous odor for 30 min attenuates the response, evidenced by subsequent testing in a Y-maze. Independently and in parallel with these studies, we developed an olfactory habituation paradigm using the T-maze, which is widely used in olfactory associative learning experiments and had already been in use for such experiments in the lab. Short repetitive or continuous odor exposure for a total of 4 min results in decreased responses both to aversive and to attractive odors. Importantly, this attenuated response complies with the parameters of habituation, as it recovers spontaneously and can be dishabituated (Thompson and Spencer, 1966; Rankin <em>et al.</em>, 2009). In addition, this paradigm facilitates the investigation of habituation latency, the initial process that precedes habituation, which may be linked to associative learning. In fact, because the equipment and mechanics of this olfactory habituation assay are similar to those used for classical odor discrimination-dependent associative learning, the paradigm is conducive to investigations of possible interdependence of these two processes. Lastly, this habituation paradigm has enabled identification of the neuronal subsets implicated in this process (Semelidou <em>et al.</em>, 2018), allowing the further study of the molecular pathways underlying habituation, in a neuronal-specific manner.</p>

When all four screws are in place, tighten them crosswise to the point that they are tight without forcing them further. If forced too tight it may damage the plexiglass screw threads. Once the sides are fastened on the base, attach the vacuum adaptors onto the vacuum ports. Make sure that the elevator is snug, but it can move up and down without difficulty.<br/><br/></li><li>Fly preparation<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Backcross control flies carrying the <em>w1118</em> mutation to the Canton-S for at least 10 generations to obtain the Cantonised-<em>w1118</em>. Outcross all the <em>Drosophila</em> lines with Cantonised-<em>w1118</em> for six generations to obtain the same genetic background for all animals used in the behavioral experiments.</li><li>Raise the flies in standard wheat-flour-sugar food supplemented with soy flour and CaCl<sub>2</sub> under a 14:10 h light-dark cycle, 60% relative humidity, at 25 Â°C, unless you use the TARGET system. In that case, raise the flies at 18 Â°C until hatching.</li><li>To collect flies for the experiment, anesthetize them under CO<sub>2</sub> at least one day before the experiment and separate them in groups of 50-60 flies. Place each group of flies in food vials at 25 Â°C, 14:10 h light-dark conditions and 60% humidity, if no transgene will be expressed during the experiment (for control experiments or mutants). For experiments with Gal4 lines, place the flies at 30 Â°C overnight to enhance transgene expression. For experiments using the TARGET system, place the flies at 30 Â°C for 2 or 3 days prior to testing. The days of transgene induction depend on the transgene used in each experiment. For neuronal silencing experiments with Shibire<sup>ts</sup>, place the flies at 32-33 Â°C for 30 min before the experiment, while for experiments with TRPA1 for neuronal activation, transfer the flies at 30-31 Â°C for the time period you want to keep the neurons activated.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Preparation before the experiment<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Transfer the flies in new food vials approximately 1 h before the experiment. Place the vials in a dark box and keep it at the temperature flies were kept before. For experiments with Shibire<sup>ts</sup>, transfer the flies in new pre-warmed vials, kept at 32-33 Â°C, 30 min before the experiment. To ensure that neuronal transmission is blocked for the same time interval for all groups of flies, transfer the flies at 32-33 Â°C sequentially during the experiment.</li><li>Prepare the behavior room. Clean the T-mazes and arms with soft cloth. Ensure that the arms fit tightly on the maze and the air flow is stable at 500 ppm (0.5 ml/min). If you use the T-maze for the first time, run a control experiment without odors to verify that there is no bias towards one arm of the maze. Check that humidity in the room ranges from 60% to 70% and the temperature from 23 to 24 Â°C. Experiments are performed under dim red light (photography dark room grade, Figure 7).</li><li>Prepare the odor and connect it to the T-maze set up. Let the odor flow for 30 min, to prime the system for the experiment. For Octanol add 1 ml 3-Octanol in a glass vial. For experiments conducted with Benzaldehyde, add 100 Î¼l of Benzaldehyde in a 14 ml Falcon. Similarly, for experiments with ethyl acetate or 2,3-butanedione prepare priming in a 14 ml Falcon with 10 Î¼l of a 0.1% dilution of ethyl acetate in water and for 2,3-butanedione with 10 Î¼l of a 0.5% dilution. The concentration of each compound and the surface area of the container (odorant meniscus) were determined empirically to produce the optimal response. Previous studies have demonstrated that the same odor compound can be either aversive or attractive, depending on the concentration employed (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2003). For odorants different than the ones described herein, avoidance experiments are required prior to habituation to standardize the odor concentrations. These odorants can be diluted either in water (ethyl acetate and 2,3-butanedione) or isopropyl myristate (Octanol, Benzaldehyde [Gouzi <em>et al.</em>, 2018])<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190531/20190531013954_2668.jpg" width="146"/><br/><strong>Figure 7.
