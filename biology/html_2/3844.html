            <h1>Bacterial Adhesion Kinetics in a High Throughput Setting in Seconds-minutes Time Resolution</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nimrod Shteindel, Yoram  Gerchman</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Bacterial surface adhesion, the first step in many important processes including biofilm formation and tissue invasion, is a fast process that occurs on a time scale of seconds. Adhesion patterns tend to be stochastic and spatially heterogeneous, especially when bacteria are present in low population densities and at early stages of adhesion to the surface. Thus, in order to observe this process, a high degree of temporal resolution is needed across a large surface area in a way that allows several replicates to be monitored. Some of the current methods used to measure bacterial adhesion include microscopy, staining-based microtiter assays, spectroscopy, and PCR. Each of these methods has advantages in assaying aspects of bacterial surface adhesion, but none can capture all features of the process. In the protocol presented here, adapted from Shteindel <em>et al.</em>, 2019, fluorescently-labeled bacteria are monitored in a multi-titer setting using a standard plate fluorimeter and a dye that absorbs light in the fluorophore excitation and emission wavelengths. The advantage of using this dye is that it restricts the depth of the optic layer to the few microns adjacent to the bottom of the microtiter well, eliminating fluorescence originating from unattached bacteria. Another advantage of this method is that this setting does not require any preparatory steps, which enables reading of the sample to be repeated or continuous. The use of a standard multi-titer well allows easy manipulation and provides flexibility in experimental design.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Bacterial adhesion is the first step of many important processes such as pathogen tissue invasion, symbiont recruitment and biofilm formation. Adhesion is a dynamic process, changing on a time scale of seconds (Fletcher, 1977; Vadillo-RodrÃ­guez <em>et al.</em>, 2004), therefore continuous, kinetic measurements are needed to study these events. Sampling a large surface area is also helpful, as adhesion tends to be heterogeneous and stochastic at a microscopic scale. In addition to having an assay that can make kinetic measurements, it is desirable to have an assay that is simple, cost-effective, and high throughput because it makes it possible to have multiple replicates and to test a wide range of experimental parameters.<br/><br/>While many methods for the measurement of adhesion have been reported - each one with advantages and disadvantages - none of the methods capture every aspect of this dynamic process. Microscopy allows detailed and direct measurement of adhesion but the main drawback of microscopy is a small field size. As a result, sampling of many different fields is needed to obtain statistical validity but sampling in this way makes it difficult to get high resolution kinetic data. This contradiction is highlighted in early time points of adhesion kinetics, when the number of cells per surface unit is low, causing a large stochastic effect due to small sample sizes (Vadillo-RodrÃ­guez <em>et al.</em>, 2004). Another popular method for bacterial attachment measurement is using crystal violet dye in microtiter plates (O'Toole, 2011). While this method is high throughput and inexpensive, it does not allow repeated measurements, making kinetics complicated and unreliable. Furthermore, sample preparation is not fast which makes this assay inadequate for monitoring events that occur at seconds-minutes timescales. Nano plasmonics is an effective way to make real time, kinetic measurements without the need for fluorescent labeling, but this method is expensive and requires highly specialized equipment, fabrication capabilities and expertise (Funari <em>et al.</em>, 2018, Abadian and Goluch, 2015). The protocol presented here uses fluorescent labeling and is able to provide real time, kinetic measurements of bacterial adhesion in different culture densities, salt concentrations and different surfaces, using a variety of bacterial species (Shteindel <em>et al.</em>, 2019), as well as changes in bacterial adhesion behavior under the effect of quorum sensing signals and in the different bacterivores (in preparation). All graphics in this protocol are adapted from Shteindel <em>et al.</em>, 2019.</p>

Sixty measurements points over six treatments carry a heavy significance penalty due to reuse of data over multiple tests, making it unusable. Normalization of this dataset allowing the use of parametric tests is also not trivial. The curves representing different treatments are separated by several standard deviations over most of the kineticsâi.e., between groups differences are larger than within group differences, making them statistically significant. <br/><br/></em> </p><p>Bacterial adhesion is often described by the DELVO model, predicting low adhesion at low and high salt concentrations, and high adhesion in median concentrations (Hermansson, 1999). Adhesion at the last time point in different salt concentrations agree with this description, but the kinetic data reveal details which are not captured in a single measurement. While 100 and 200 mM salt concentrations produce similar adhesion outcomes after one hour, adhesion kinetics at 100 mM is higher than at 200mM. Similarly, 400 and 0 mM salt concentrations produce comparable adhesion at the end of experiment, but a higher kinetics is seen at the 400 mM treatment.</p><p>  In order to verify that the test measures adhering bacteria, and not unattached bacteria near the bottom of the plate, or sedimented bacteria, we introduced a post kinetics measurement. In this measurement we remove the liquid in each well and replace it with sterile buffer, removing the vast majority of un-attached bacteria and diluting any remaining un-attached cells. Preforming a second bottom fluorescence reading allow us to evaluate the fraction of fluorescence originating from attached bacteria at the last kinetic time point. Post kinetics values are practically identical, suggesting all fluorescence read at the last time point originated from attached bacteria (Figure 2). The only statistics used is Pearson correlation calculated using the Excel automatic function.</p><p><br/><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3844/bioprotoc-10-23-3844-g002.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.
