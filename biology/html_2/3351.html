            <h1><em>In vitro</em> Intestinal Epithelial Wound-healing Assays Using Electric  Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing Instrument</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Here, we describe an <em>in vitro</em> epithelial wound-healing assay using Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) technology. The ECIS technology is a real time cell growth assay based on a small (250 Î¼m diameter) active gold electrode which resistance is measured continuously. When intestinal epithelial cells reach confluency on the gold electrode, resistances reach a plateau. For the wound-healing assays, confluent intestinal epithelial monolayers are subjected to a current of 40 kHz frequency, 1,400 Î¼A amplitude, and 30-second duration. This kills the cells around the small active gold electrode, causing detachment and generating a wound that is healed by surrounding cells that have not been submitted to the current pulse. Wound healing is then assessed by continuous resistance measurements for approximately 30 h after wound. Both cell wounding and measurements of the subsequent healing process are carried out under computer control that takes online measurements each 30 s and stores the data. ECIS technology can be used to study the underlying causes for impaired mucosal healing and to test the efficacy of drugs in mucosal healing.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Damage and impairment of the intestinal surface barrier are observed in the course of various diseases including Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Such characteristics may result in an increased penetration and absorption of toxic and immunogenic factors into the body leading to inflammation, uncontrolled immune response, and disequilibrium of the homeostasis of the host. Wound-healing assays in tissue culture have been used for many years to estimate the migration and proliferation rates of different cells under various culture conditions. These assays involve using instruments such as razor blades to âwoundâ a confluent monolayer of cells. The main disadvantages of these assays include a lack of reproducibility and an inability to precisely quantify wound healing. Here, we describe the ECIS technology, a non-invasive technique which monitors live cells <em>in situ</em> and in real time, which is an ideal cell-based system for the screening of potential drugs capable of achieving higher mucosal healing rates that provide significant clinical benefit for Ulcerative Colitis patients.</p>

These results clearly demonstrate that IL-22 can enhance the healing of a wounded colonic epithelial layer. In another study (Figure 6 in Charrier <em>et al</em>., 2005), we have demonstrated that after the wound, the resistance of Caco2-BBE/ADAM-15 cells (Caco2-BBE over-expressing ADAM-15) did not increase to reach the resistance values of the non-wounded cells (Figure 6A in Charrier <em>et al</em>., 2005). By contrast, the resistance of Caco2-BBE/Vect cells (endogenous ADAM-15 expression in Caco2-BBE) increased over time and reached the resistance values of the non-wounded cells (Figure 6A in Charrier <em>et al</em>., 2005). These results are in correlation with the observations made at the end of the experiments where the wounds were completely healed in Caco2-BBE/Vect cells but were unable to heal in Caco2-BBE/ADAM-15 cells (Figure 6B in Charrier <em>et al</em>., 2005).</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29202">### Data analysis</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Go to âFileâ (Figure 7), click on âExport dataâ (Figure 7), select âAll dataâ or âSelected wells/timeâ (Figure 6), select âTo excelâ or âGraph dataâ (Figure 7).</li><li>Use the data in excel for statistical analysis and create the experiment graph.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29203">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Cell culture medium<br/>Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium containing 10% Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin </li><li>IL22 stock solution<br/>10 Î¼g/ml in cell culture medium<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29204">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">EV is a recipient of the Career Development Award from the Crohnâs and Colitis Foundation.
