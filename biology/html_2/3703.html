            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cell signalling, cell secretion, and plasma membrane repair are processes that critically rely on intracellular vesicles, important components of the endocytic and secretory pathways. More specifically, the strategic distribution of intracellular vesicles is important for diverse cellular processes. The method presented here is a simple, affordable, and efficient tool to analyze the distribution of intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes, endosomes, Golgi vesicles or secretory granules under different experimental conditions. The method is an accessible way to analyze the density and dispersion of intracellular vesicles by combining immunofluorescence with pixel-based quantification software (<em>e.g.</em>, ImageJ/FIJI). This protocol can be used widely within the scientific community because it utilizes ImageJ/FIJI, an open source software that is free. By tracking fluorescent vesicles based on their position relative to cell nuclei we are able to quantify and analyze their distribution throughout the cell.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Intracellular vesicles are important components of the endocytic and secretory pathways, which are responsible for maintaining several critical cellular functions. For this reason, many studies have focused on the pathways that regulate the distribution of vesicles in both physiological and pathological conditions, while others have examined the consequences of aberrant vesicle distribution in many important cellular processes.<br/><br/>In 1988, Aunis and Bader showed that two pools of secretory vesicles exist in secretory cells (Aunis and Bader, 1988). The first pool was located just below the plasma membrane and the secretion of this pool was not regulated by the cytoskeleton, but attached to the plasma membrane as a result of being bound to elements of the cytoskeleton; the second pool was attached to actin filaments, slightly away from the membrane, which could be mobilized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane after the depletion of the first pool. This was achieved by depolarization of the membrane, rearrangement of the actin filaments and dissolution of the cytoskeleton barrier, leading to its detachment from the cytoskeleton to reach the exocytic sites.<br/><br/>Koseoglu <em>et al.</em> (2011) also provided evidence for the existence of different pools of secretory vesicles and that membrane cholesterol content is important for exocytosis of these pools. The authors observed that membrane cholesterol sequestration from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla did not alter either the kinetics or the amount of release of the first pool of vesicles, which was already pre-anchored to the plasma membrane. However, the subsequent release of the remaining vesicles, belonging to the second slow-releasing pool, also called the reserve pool, was compromised by changes in membrane cholesterol levels. The authors further suggested that the change in the polymerization of actin filaments induced by cholesterol depletion could be compromising the mobilization of the slow releasing or reserve vesicles.<br/><br/>Mobilization of lysosome pools is described in several situations (Brito <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Lawrence and Zoncu, 2019). One example is plasma membrane repair (PMR), a mechanism widely used by nucleated cells to maintain plasma membrane integrity. Briefly, when a cell suffers a micro-injury, its membrane must be sealed to avoid depolarization, cytoplasm leakage and cell death. Upon injury, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> flows through the lesions into the cytoplasm, increasing cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which in turn induces lysosomal exocytosis. Lysosomal exocytosis is then followed by a massive endocytosis, which reseals the plasma membrane by carrying wounded portions in endosomes into the cell. The whole process involves the participation of lysosomal hydrolases, which act on the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane and facilitates the endocytic process by inducing plasma membrane invagination and its inward budding (Idone <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Tam <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Castro-Gomes <em>et al.</em>, 2016).<br/><br/>Some parasites, such as <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> and <em>Leishmania amazonensis</em>, can subvert PMR to invade different host cells (Horta <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Tardieux <em>et al.</em> (1992) verified that the mobilization of lysosomes is a key event for effective cell infection by <em>T. cruzi</em>, which subverts PMR mechanism to invade cells. Hissa <em>et al.</em> (2012), studying how the protozoan parasite <em>T. cruzi </em>enters cardiomyocytes, showed that depletion of membrane cholesterol led to a decrease in host cell invasion by interfering with lysosome recruitment and fusion during parasite-host cell interaction. More recently, Cavalcante-Costa <em>et al.</em> (2019) showed that lysosomal positioning is also crucial for <em>L. amazonensis</em> invasion to non-phagocytic cells, using basically the same mechanism previously described for <em>T. cruzi</em>.<br/><br/>Therefore, lysosomal positioning is crucial for PMR and cell invasion by some pathogens, as well as many other cellular mechanisms. These vesicles can be found around cell nuclei or spread throughout the cell, moving fast along cell microtubules towards the cell periphery in a stop-and-go manner (Cabukusta and Neefjes, 2018), depending on cell type or special conditions, such as the presence of certain drugs or plasma membrane injury by cytotoxins. Since lysosomes function as Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive vesicles (Rodriguez <em>et al.</em>, 1997), their positioning and exocytosis are finely regulated by the presence of this ion in the cytosol.<br/><br/>The examples above show that the distribution of intracellular vesicles can be disturbed by several conditions and that their correct positioning is pivotal for physiological cellular functions. Thus, it is critical to have a reliable method to measure the distribution and movement of intracellular vesicles. Here we describe a method to quantify lysosomes in cells that takes advantage of immunofluorescence, a commonly-used technique, and open source software ImageJ/FIJI (Schneider <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Schindelin <em>et al.</em>, 2012). This protocol provides a way for researchers to compare changes in the distribution of lysosomes in diverse processes and it can be adapted to studies involving different types of intracellular vesicles such as endosomes, Golgi vesicles or secretory granules.</p>

The first region surrounds the nucleus, and will be referred to as the perinuclear region, which can be defined as having 0.5 of the nuclei radius. Since it is common for the nucleus to be an irregular size, or oval, a short (r) and a long (R) radius have to be defined to define the perinuclear region accordingly (adapted from Nabavi <em>et al.</em>, 2008 and as illustrated in Figure 1). Measurements will be made throughout the whole area defined by the perimeter traced around the nucleus considering the starting point from the center of the nuclei to r + 0.5r or R + 0.5R, removing the DAPI channel. The second region (pericellular) is determined as the cell periphery ranging from the end of the perinuclear region to the border of the cell. These measurements can be made using ImageJ/FIJI software or similar. Just remember to calibrate the software to provide measurements in Î¼m instead of pixels. To calibrate, open an image that has been taken using the same microscope (with the same objective) of an element of a well-known size, for instance a scale bar or a ruler with a micrometric scale. Using the line selection tool, draw a line with the same measures of the known element, press analyze &gt; set scale. ImageJ/FIJI will provide the distance in pixels. Complete blank fields with the known distance and the unit (Î¼m). The calibration can be applied to the open image or it can be applied to other images by checking the "Global" option.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200730/20200730060824_1875.jpg" width="145"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.
