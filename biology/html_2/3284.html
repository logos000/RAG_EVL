            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Despite transcriptional silencing in mature sperm and cytoplasmic expulsion of RNA during the final sperm maturation process, thousands of RNAs have been successfully identified in ejaculated sperm. Although most of RNAsâ function is still unknown, it is suggested that sperm RNAs have a vital biological role in fertilization and post-fertilization events. Nevertheless, the lack of accurate RNA isolation techniques and the resultant good quality sperm RNA has hampered the exploration of sperm RNAs function. Additionally, small non-coding RNAs are found in extracellular fluids including seminal plasma. These small RNAs may participate in cell to cell communication or intracellular and extracellular message transmission. Developing precise protocols to extract RNA from sperm and seminal plasma is critical to elucidate sperm physiology and paternal contributions to fertilization and post-fertilization events. A detailed procedure consisting of semen collection, separation of sperm and seminal plasma, extracting RNA from sperm and seminal plasma, and determining the quantity and quality of RNA for boar semen is presented here. This efficient protocol can be extrapolated to isolate RNAs from sperm and seminal plasma across mammalian species.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Transcriptionally inactive mature sperm contains a complex population of RNAs including non-coding small RNAs (Ostermeier <em>et al.</em>, 2002). These RNAs can participate in fertilization and post-fertilization events including zygotic gene activation. Recently, it was suggested that sperm also can pick up small RNAs on their way during the epididymal transit and these small RNAs can influence the gene regulation in developing embryos for efficient implantation (Kasimanickam <em>et al.</em>, 2019b). It is important to study the RNA profiles in immature and mature sperm harvested from various locations such as caput epididymis, cauda epididymis, ejaculated sperm and seminal plasma to know how these RNAs are shuttled between sperm cells and seminal plasma. Better understanding of coding and non-coding RNAs in sperm and seminal plasma by gene expression arrays and microarrays allows investigating the problems associated with infertility. Nevertheless, success of microarray and gene expression analyses is extremely dependent on the quality and quantity of the RNA obtained from sperm and seminal plasma. Therefore, the development of methods that isolate highly purified and intact RNA from sperm and seminal plasma is of utmost importance. Purification of sperm and seminal plasma, RNA extraction from sperm and seminal plasma and evaluation of RNA quality are the critical steps to be considered to achieve these goals. Since sperm and seminal plasma contain a very small amount of RNA, a method consisting capture of RNA by silica membrane and elution using nuclease-free water (column-based approach) is more advantageous to perform rather than a method involving precipitation of RNA. Hence, detailed protocols for semen collection, semen processing to purify sperm and seminal plasma, RNA isolation from sperm and seminal plasma adopting a column-based approach and determining the quantity and quality of RNA for boars are described here.</p>

When haploid spermatids undergo morphological modifications and transition into elongated sperm, transition proteins, protamines and histones play a unique role in condensing spermatid chromatin (Miller <em>et al</em>., 2005). Sperm, in addition to the main contribution of paternal genome, deliver a large range of RNA molecules to the oocyte during fertilization and these RNAs may have a functional role in fertilization and early embryonic development (Boerke <em>et al</em>., 2007; GÃ²dia <em>et al</em>., 2018). Non-coding RNAs also contributes to fertilization, embryogenesis and offspring health and participate in transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (Champroux <em>et al</em>., 2018). Transcriptional activity is found to be higher in primary spermatocytes and spermatids compared to secondary spermatocytes and then the transcription is almost arrested during the nuclear elongation phase of the final maturation step in spermatogenesis (Dadoune <em>et a</em>l., 2004). Presence of coding and non-coding RNAs in sperm has been revealed by a variety of techniques, microarray (Liu, T. <em>et al</em>., 2012; Bansal et al., 2015), qRT-PCR (Kasimanickam and Kastelic, 2016; Kasimanickam <em>et al</em>., 2019a and 2019b) and RNA sequencing (Du <em>et al</em>., 2014; Mao <em>et al</em>., 2014) and these RNAs may originate from germ and somatic cells and partake in a variety of functions.<br/>  Sperm transcripts can be used as candidate markers for male fertility. High fertility bulls had higher levels of sperm transcripts and their proteins were correlated to important cellular processes such as metabolism, signal transduction, translation, glycosylation, and protein degradation (Lalancette <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Kasimanickam <em>et al.</em>, 2019a). Five genes, RPL31, PRKCE, PAPSS2, PLP1, and R1G7 were differentially seen between fresh and frozen-thawed sperm in Holstein bulls (Chen <em>et al</em>., 2015). Sperm-borne miRNAs were found to be needed for normal fertilization and preimplantation embryo development in mice (Yuan <em>et al</em>., 2016). Sperm transcripts were associated with in-vitro motility and field fertility in bulls using stringent RNA isolation protocols (Bissonnette <em>et al</em>., 2009; Kasimanickam et al., 2012). A total of 7721 long non-coding RNAs and 6097 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in sperm between diabetic and normal group of mice (Jiang et al., 2016). Sperm-borne microRNA-34c was determined to be important for the first cleavage division in mice (Liu, W. M. <em>et al</em>., 2012). A complex population of male-derived small non-coding RNAs were seen in the zygote after fertilization (Krawetz <em>et al</em>., 2011). Since the role of these sperm transcripts is suggested in fertilization as well as zygotic and early embryonic development, a better understanding of these RNAs is imperative. However, the study of sperm RNAs has been challenging because of the difficulty accompanying with sperm RNA isolation. Several sperm RNA isolation protocols have been shown extremely variable sperm RNA yield due not only to the different approaches used but also to the heterogeneity of RNA within an individual sperm (Lalancette <em>et al</em>., 2009; Mao <em>et al</em>., 2013, Mao et al., 2014; Barragan <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/>  Purification of sperm, RNA extraction and evaluation of RNA quality are the critical steps that need to be focused to obtain quality RNA. Besides sperm, an ejaculate also contains somatic cells, including immature germ cells, leucocytes and epithelial cells. Consequently, somatic cell removal is performed to avoid contamination of somatic cell RNAs and to derive only sperm transcripts. However, superior quality semen does not contain either immature germ cells or somatic cells (leucocytes or epithelial cells). Several methods such as swim-up procedure, density gradient centrifugation and lysis protocol are used to remove somatic cells from the ejaculate. Since seminal plasma also contains RNA, complete removal of seminal plasma is furthermore imperative.<br/>  To extract RNA from purified sperm, there are two methods primarily being used. One method is based on phase separation and precipitation whereas the other method is dependent on phase separation and column capture of RNAs. Since sperm contains a very small amount of RNA, capturing RNAs by a spin column and then eluting in a small volume of nuclease-free water yield reproducible results in specific to RNAâs quantity and quality. Sperm should be devoid of contaminant of somatic cells such as leukocytes and epithelial cells. Semen collected from mature and healthy domestic animals does not generally contain somatic cells. Presence of somatic cells can be evaluated by microscopic examination. RNAâs quantity and quality can be determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Fisher Thermo Scientific, Bothell, WA, USA) or an Agilent BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Sperm does not contain ribosomal RNAs, 18S and 28S ribosomal subunits (Goodrich <em>et al.</em>, 2013) in contrast to other types of cells. The absence of these ribosomal RNAs in the elute can validate the purity of sperm RNAs.<br/>  Messenger RNAs have been found in mature sperm in different animal species. Transcriptome analysis of ejaculated sperm has been performed in pigs, many mRNAs have been identified in sperm, and these mRNAs have been associated with biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components of spermatogenesis and other testicular functions (Yang <em>et al</em>., 2009). Various sperm transcripts at different expression levels have been noticed between capacitated and non-capacitated sperm and variation in mRNAs level in sperm caused different cleavage rate in pigs (Hwang <em>et a</em><em>l</em>., 2013). Sperm containing abundant levels of MYC, CYP19, ADAM2, PRM1 and PRM2 instigated the increased cleavage rate. Often physical stress, environmental stress and infections affect the boar semen quality. In addition to the conventional semen parameters, sperm transcriptomics could serve as a reliable biomarker to evaluate sperm quality and fertility. Sperm delivers not only DNA to the oocyte but also bring thousands of RNAs to the oocyte, and these coding and non-coding RNA species greatly influence gene regulation in developing embryos for efficient implantation and placental development. Although small quantity of RNA is detected in seminal plasma when compared to sperm RNA in each semen sample (Kasimanickam <em>et al.</em>, 2019b), comparative analysis of expression levels will be crucial to elucidate their functional significance and mechanistic interpretation of cell to cell communication and shuttling between endogenous and exogenous environment.<br/>  Therefore, efficient methods of sperm purification, RNA extraction from sperm and characterizing RNAâs quality are essential to elucidate their clinical significance. In this protocol, details procedures for the separation of pure sperm population and seminal plasma from high-quality semen via washing steps, extraction of measurable quantities of sperm and seminal plasma RNAs using membrane column capturing and determining the quantity and quality are presented. The outcome of these procedures appears to be reproducible for different boars. In summary, these techniques can be repeated for superior quality semen to obtain a detectable amount of good quality sperm and seminal plasma RNAs to utilize for downstream applications (Figure 3).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="127" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190701/20190701071727_4634.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 3. Flow charts showing the use of sperm and seminal plasma RNA in downstream experiments</strong><br/><br/><strong>Critical parameter and troubleshooting:</strong><br/>Although high quality ejaculated semen from superior genetics mature boars are devoid of somatic cells such as leukocytes and epithelial cells, many semen samples including samples with the history of infertility have a significant number of immature germ cells, somatic cells and bacteria. Removal of somatic and immature cells is critical to prevent the contamination of RNA from these  immature, epithelial, inflammatory and bacterial cells. In those circumstances, density gradient separation technique, somatic cell lysis strategy, and swim-up protocol can be performed to purify mature sperm. For instance, discontinuous Percoll (90% and 45% Percoll layers) gradient separation of pure sperm can be employed and selection of these procedures is based on the subsequent application of the study. Swim-up protocol is better for the <em>in-vitro</em> fertilization and the follow-up transcriptome analysis whereas Percoll gradient separation is appropriate for a transcriptome study to determine the sperm quality. Since sperm contains very scanty amount of RNA, total sperm RNA can be captured by a membranous column and subsequently the RNA can be eluted in a small volume of nuclease-free water. When the small volume elution is difficult, a larger volume of nuclease-free water can be used to elute the RNA and subsequently the diluted samples can be concentrated using an RNA concentration protocol. RNAs dissociate into the aqueous phase and hence phase separation is critical. The phase separation should be carefully performed not touching the interphase. When the quantity and purity of the RNA are evaluated using NanoDrop spectrophotometer, the ratio of absorbance at 260 and 280 nm wavelength should be close to 2.0. A small change in pH can overestimate/underestimate the ratio. If the results are not reproducible, another type of spectrophotometer can be used to evaluate the quality. The absorbance spectral graph should be ideal and should indicate the perfect 260/280 ratio.<br/>  Superior genetics mature boars produce 100-250 ml of sperm-rich fraction. Semen can be collected thrice weekly for an optimal quantity and quality. Concentration can range from 0.7 to 2 billion sperm/ml based on the secretions of accessory glands. Sperm motility varies from 80% to 90%. A total of 500 million sperm yield RNA ranging from 3,000 ng to 4,500 ng. The ratio of absorbance at 260/280 nm wavelength ranges from 1.92 to 2.08. RNA yield from 150 Î¼l of seminal plasma varies from 720 ng to 960 ng whereas the purity ranges from 1.92 to 2.08.<br/>  Semen collection, separation and purification of sperm and seminal plasma, total RNA extraction and characterization can be performed in two weeks for ten boars, provided trained mature boars for semen collection, other supplies, equipment for laboratory work and personnel are available.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28246">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This detailed protocol presented here is expanded from our publications, Kasimanickam and Kastelic (2016) and Kasimanickam <em>et al</em>.
