            <h1>Serial Cryomicrotomy of <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> for Serial Electron Cryotomography</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Cai Tong Ng, Mark S. Ladinsky, Lu  Gan</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Electron cryotomography (cryo-ET) is an increasingly popular technique to study cellular structures and macromolecules <em>in situ</em>. Due to poor penetration of electrons through thick biological samples, the vitreously frozen samples for cryo-ET need to be thin. For frozen-hydrated cells, such samples can be produced either by cryomicrotomy or cryo-FIB-milling. As a result, a tomogram of such a sample contains information of a small fraction of the entire cell volume, making it challenging to image rare structures in the cell or to determine the distribution of scattered structures. Here, we describe the tools and workflow that we designed to facilitate serial cryomicrotomy, which makes possible the exploration of a larger volume of individual cells at molecular resolution. We successfully used serial cryomicrotomy to locate and image the Dam1/DASH complex located at microtubule plus ends inside mitotic <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> cells.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Chromosomes have to be coupled to kinetochore microtubules for successful segregation during cell division. The kinetochore is the macromolecular complex responsible for coupling the chromosomes to the kinetochore microtubulesâ dynamic plus ends. In the budding yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, the Dam1/DASH complex is a part of the kinetochore that interfaces with kinetochore microtubules. There have been many studies to reconstitute kinetochore subcomplexes <em>in vitro</em> to understand its structure and function (Musacchio and Desai, 2017; Hinshaw and Harrison, 2018). These attempts have led to multiple models that suggest how the kinetochore functions. To test some of these outer-kinetochore models in <em>S. cerevisiae</em>, we use electron cryotomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the <em>S. cerevisiae</em> outer kinetochore at molecular resolution (4-6 nm) <em>in situ</em>.<br/><br/>Cryo-ET is an increasingly popular technique used to study cellular structures and macromolecules <em>in situ</em> at molecular resolution (Ng and Gan, 2020). Many of the earlier cryo-ET studies involve using biological samples that are thick (&gt; 500 nm), resulting in reconstructions with low contrast. To increase the contrast of the reconstructions while preserving cellular context of the samples, the samples have to be much thinner, but not too thin. Therefore, a reasonable compromise is ~100 nm thickness. The two main techniques used to obtain thin samples for cryo-ET are cryo-FIB-milling and cryomicrotomy. Cryo-FIB-milling involves using gallium ions to sputter away biological material until a thin plank-like cryo-lamella of biological sample remains (Marko <em>et al</em>., 2006; Hayles <em>et al</em>., 2007; Rigort <em>et al</em>., 2010; Villa <em>et al</em>., 2013; Mahamid <em>et al</em>., 2015; Medeiros <em>et al</em>., 2018). Cryomicrotomy involves cutting a frozen-hydrated sample, such as a cell paste, into thin cryosections using a diamond knife (Al-Amoudi <em>et al</em>., 2004a and 2004b). Each cryo-lamella or cryosection contains only a small fraction of a cell volume. It is worth noting, however, that serial cryomicrotomy would allow us to explore a larger fraction of a cell at molecular resolution compared to cryo-FIB-milling. This can be done by imaging multiple consecutive cryosections of the same cell. Here, we describe both the tools and workflow that we designed to facilitate serial cryomicrotomy and data collection. We successfully used serial cryomicrotomy and serial cryo-ET to locate and image the Dam1/DASH complex in <em>S. cerevisiae</em>. We also explore the cryomicrotomy parameters that minimize artefacts in yeast cryosections. This approach has also been used to study mitotic fission yeast and meiotic budding yeast (Cai <em>et al</em>., 2018; Ma <em>et al</em>., 2019).<br/></p>

Crevassing artefacts are diminished when cutting is done at -140 Â°C instead of at -150 Â°C. The difference is especially prominent when comparing crevassing effects on extracellular buffer (white rectangles). B. The depth of crevasses over biological material also decreases from approximately 34 nm to 19 nm as a result of cutting at -140 Â°C instead of -150 Â°C. C. The magnitude of compression of the cryosection decreases when cutting with a 25Â° knife, resulting in a thinner cryosection. All cryosections shown here were produced with a 100 nm feed. <p class="pptt" id="biaoti38953">### Notes</p><p><strong>General tips:</strong> </p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>To avoid injury, do not touch the knife blades.
