            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Granulomas are organized multicellular structures that constitute the hallmark of an infection by the human pathogen <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb</em>). A better understanding of the complex host-<em>Mtb</em> interactions within the granulomaâs environment may lead to new therapeutic or preventive tools to improve the control of the tuberculosis pandemic. To date, several <em>in vitro</em> models that are able to mimic human nascent granulomas have been reported. Here we describe a protocol in which <em>Mtb</em>-infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are embedded within a collagen matrix leading to the formation of three-dimensional micro-granulomas. Subsequently, PBMCs and <em>Mtb</em> can be retrieved allowing multiparametric readouts from both the host and the pathogen. In addition to the incorporation of a physiological extracellular matrix, this model has the singular advantage of recapitulating dormant-like <em>Mtb</em> features, as well as reproducing <em>Mtb</em> resuscitation observed under immunomodulatory treatments, which have not been reported in other published protocols to generate <em>in vitro</em> granulomas.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an air-borne disease that encompasses pulmonary and extra-pulmonary infections by the human pathogen <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb</em>). Causing an estimated 1.5 million deaths in 2019 (WHO, 2019), TB remains the world’s deadliest infectious disease. The hallmark of the immunopathogenesis of TB is the formation of structurally organized, multicellular clusters called granulomas (Gengenbacher and Kaufmann, 2012). These structures mainly consist of a core of infected and non-infected macrophages surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes. The hostile environment within granulomas pushes <em>Mtb</em> to enter a slow- or non-replicating dormant state likely associated with a latent form of the disease. Consequently, <em>Mtb</em> dormancy leads to increased tolerance to antibiotics targeting metabolic pathways active during mycobacterial replication.<br/><br/>New strategies are urgently needed in order to lessen the TB death toll. Such strategies may arise from a better understanding of the infection within the granuloma’s environment. However, the complex pathophysiology of <em>Mtb</em> infection makes the development of relevant preclinical models particularly challenging. Despite the widespread use of animal models in the TB field, the establishment of latency and granulomatous lesions comparable to the ones seen in humans can only be observed in non-human primates. Yet, drawbacks inherent to this animal model, such as its high cost or ethical concerns, have favored the development of <em>in vitro</em> models (Guirado and Schlesinger, 2013). In that context, several independent groups have reported <em>in vitro</em> models based on the infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with virulent <em>Mtb</em> (Kapoor <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Guirado <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Agrawal <em>et al.</em>, 2016; ArbuÃ©s <em>et al.</em>, 2020; Tezera <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Despite lacking some relevant cell types (<em>e.g.</em>, neutrophils) and the full tissue conditions (such as lung structure or vascularization), such models are able to mimic the organization of human nascent granulomas, orchestrated by relevant cytokines.<br/><br/>The protocol described here notably incorporates two major advantageous features. On the one hand, <em>Mtb</em>-infected PBMCs are embedded in a three-dimensional (3D) matrix of collagen and fibronectin, main components of the lung extracellular matrix (Stek <em>et al.</em>, 2018). On the other hand, <em>Mtb</em> displays features associated with dormancy such as accumulation of intracellular triacylglycerides into lipid inclusions, loss of acid-fastness, transcriptional changes leading to a shift in carbon and energy metabolisms, and increase in antibiotic tolerance (Kapoor <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Remarkably, this model was also able to reproduce the differential rate of latent TB reactivation observed in the clinic upon treatment with different TNF-α-neutralizing biologics (ArbuÃ©s <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Some particular limitations of this model to take into account are the difficulty of adding new immune cells for dynamic studies or its relatively low throughput.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the <em>in vitro</em> granuloma model described hereunder is particularly relevant for studies focusing on mycobacterial dormancy as well as further understanding the mechanisms involved in <em>Mtb</em> resuscitation.<br/></p></p>

RNA analysis from both host and <em>Mtb</em> can be performed following standard procedures subsequently to TRI-reagent<sup>Â®</sup> treatment. <em>Mtb</em> load can be quantified by determination of colony forming units (CFU) on Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with 10% OADC (0.05% oleic acid, 5% bovine albumin fraction V, 2% dextrose and 0.004% catalase). Importantly, dual auramine/Nile red staining can be used as a proxy of the metabolically active or dormant-like status of the recovered bacilli, respectively.
