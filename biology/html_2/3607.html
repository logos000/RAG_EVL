            <h1>Assessing <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> Trogocytosis By Murine CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jim Reed, Scott A. Wetzel</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Recognition of antigens by lymphocytes (B, T, and NK) on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC) leads to lymphocyte activation and the formation of an immunological synapse between the lymphocyte and the APC. At the immunological synapse APC membrane and associated membrane proteins can be transferred to the lymphocyte in a process called trogocytosis. The detection of trogocytosed molecules provides insights to the activation state, antigen specificity, and effector functions and differentiation of the lymphocytes. Here we outline our protocol for identifying trogocytosis-positive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>. <em>In vitro</em>, antigen presenting cells are surface biotinylated and pre-loaded with magnetic polystyrene beads before incubating for a short time with <em>in vitro</em> activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell blasts (90 min) or naÃ¯ve T cells (3-24 h). After T cell recovery and APC depletion by magnetic separation trogocytosis positive (trog<sup>+</sup>) cells are identified by streptavidin staining of trogocytosed, biotinylated APC membrane proteins. Their activation phenotype, effector function, and effector differentiation are subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry immediately or after subsequent incubation. Similarly, trogocytosis-positive cells can be identified and similarly analyzed by flow cytometry. Previous studies have described methods for analyzing T cell trogocytosis to identify antigen-specific cells or the antigenic epitopes recognized by the cells. With the current protocol, the effects of trogocytosis on the individual T cell or the ability of trog<sup>+</sup> T cells to modulate the activation and function of other immune cells can be assessed over an extended period of time.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Trogocytosis is the intercellular transfer of plasma membrane and membrane-associated molecules. This phenomenon has been widely studied in the analysis of immune cell interactions and has been observed to include transfer to CD4<sup>+</sup> (Wetzel <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Shi <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Adamopoulou <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Hudrisier <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Umeshappa and Xiang, 2010; Baba <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Osborne and Wetzel, 2012; Reed and Wetzel, 2019), CD8<sup>+</sup> (Hudrisier <em>et al.</em>, 2007 and 2011; Riond <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Gary <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Uzana <em>et al.</em>, 2012) and Î³Î´ T cells (Espinosa <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Gertner <em>et al.</em>, 2007). This phenomenon is not limited to T lymphocytes as B cells (Aucher <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Gardell and Parker, 2017), NK cells (Carlin <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Poupot <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Nakayama <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Miner <em>et al.</em>, 2015), basophils (Miyake <em>et al.</em>, 2017), macrophages (Daubeuf <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Sarvari <em>et al.</em>, 2015), neutrophils (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Valgardsdottir <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Mercer <em>et al.</em>, 2018), and dendritic cells (Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Bonaccorsi <em>et al.</em>, 2014) all perform trogocytosis (Ambudkar <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Lis <em>et al.</em>, 2010; LeMaoult <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/> <br/>For adaptive lymphocytes, trogocytosis leads to the presence antigen-presenting cell derived molecules on the cells. This raises the possibility that these molecules may impact the biological functions of those cells. Trogocytosis-positive (trog<sup>+</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can themselves act as antigen presenting cells (Xiang <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Shi <em>et al.</em>, 2006; LeMaoult <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Helft <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Ford McIntyre <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Umeshappa and Xiang, 2010) and we have also shown that these molecules (such as peptide-loaded MHC molecules) can interact with receptors on the cell surface (such as the T cell antigen receptor) and trigger intracellular signaling (Wetzel <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Osborne and Wetzel, 2012; Reed and Wetzel, 2019). For T cells, acquisition of APC membrane has been used as an indicator of activation (Hudrisier <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Puaux <em>et al.</em>, 2006) and has been used to identify peptide-specific T cells (Puaux <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Dhainaut and Moser, 2014) and identify T cell epitopes (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Previous methods have been published to analyze trogocytosis (Puaux <em>et al.</em>, 2006), but with the <em>in vitro</em> protocol outlined here (Wetzel <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Osborne and Wetzel, 2012; Reed and Wetzel, 2019) investigators can analyze the impact that trogocytosis has on cells for up to 7 days after recovery of APC. The <em>in vivo</em> protocol outlined here also makes it possible to examine how trogocytosis modulates immune responses <em>in vivo</em> (Kennedy <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Adamopoulou <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Zhou <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Romagnoli <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Dhainaut and Moser, 2014).</p>

We predominantly use peptide-pulsed primary bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) or transfected murine fibroblasts expressing CD80, ICAM-1 and an MHC Class II molecule covalently attached to antigenic peptide via a flexible linker (Wetzel </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2002). BMDC are grown in cRPMI and fibroblast APC are grown in cDMEM.</em> <ol class="npwtwo"><li>To generate the BMDC, culture bone marrow cells isolated from mouse femurs and for 6 days in sterile 100 mm diameter non-tissue culture Petri dishes at 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in cRPMI medium containing 30 ng/ml recombinant murine granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) at 37 Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Add fresh culture media and GM-CSF on day 3 and harvest non-adherent cells on day 6. Activate these non-adherent cells by plating on tissue culture-coated 6-well plates with addition of Sigma adjuvant system at 125 ng/ml 18 h prior to use (Inaba <em>et al.</em>, 1992 and 2009). Resulting adherent cells were surface biotinylated (as described in A4-A6) and exogenously loaded with antigenic peptide by addition of peptide solution (to a final concentration 2.5 ÂµM) to BMDC culture for at least 2 h before use. Resulting adherent cell population is &gt; 90% CD11c<sup>+</sup> (Reed and Wetzel, 2019).</li><li>Grow APC to 70-80% confluence in tissue-culture grade flasks or Petri dishes. Following surface biotinylation, typical recovery of live APC is ~70%.</li><li>Remove APC from flasks/plates with 0.2% EDTA in PBS, or a cell scraper. Trypsin-EDTA can be used, but ensure that molecules of interest are not targets of enzymatic cleavage.</li><li>Remove protein from culture media by washing cells ~1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml, wash 3 times in PBS pH 7.4. Centrifuge cells at 500 <em>x g</em> for 5 min in 15 ml conical tubes, decant supernatant, resuspend cell pellet and repeat for each wash. The last wash may be performed in PBS pH 8.0, or 0.1 M carbonate buffer depending on recommended buffer for labeling the specific substrate.</li><li>Resuspend cells according to protocol provided with the NHS-LC-Biotin manufacturer (typically between 0.5 and 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml) in PBS pH 8.0 containing 0.1 mg/ml NHS-LC-Biotin reagent. Incubate at room temperature for 15-20 min.<br/><em>Note: Alternatively cells may be labeled at 4 Â°C to minimize internalization of biotinylated proteins, but this is generally not necessary.</em> </li><li>Quench the reaction with 10x volume of PBS pH 7.4 containing 100 mM glycine. Centrifuge cells at 500 <em>x g</em> for 5 min in 15 ml conical tubes. Wash again in the same 100 mM glycine buffer for 5 min before centrifuging.</li><li>Resuspend cells in cell culture media containing 10% FBS, and count live cells using trypan blue exclusion.</li><li>At this point, cells can be plated and incubated overnight for use the following day, or may be used on the same day, providing enough time (~2 h) is allowed for APC to strongly adhere to surfaces. If B cells are to be used as APC, this incubation time is not necessary. We have found that a 2.5:1 T cell:APC ratio to be effective in stimulating T cells during the trogocytosis assay (4), though this number may be titrated out, and ratios between 10:1 and 1:10 T:APC may be used, if desired.</li><li>Plating of APC: Resuspend cells at 0.25 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and plate 2 ml/well in 6-well plates (assuming doubling time of cells is ~12 h for cell line). If primary bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) are used, or the trogocytosis assay is to be performed the same day, double the concentration to 0.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml for a final count of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well at the time of the trogocytosis-assay. Primary BMDC are cultured in cRPMI and transfected fibroblasts are cultured in cDMEM.</li><li>If loading cells with peptide, peptide can be added at desired concentration at the time of APC plating, or 1-2 h prior to use in the trogocytosis assay.</li><li>To activate APC, plate BMDC on tissue-culture treated plates or Petri-dishes and add Sigma Adjuvant System or pattern recognition receptor (PRR) agonists, such as LPS, at the time of APC plating.</li><li>Incubate cells at 37 Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until use in the trogocytosis assay.</li><li>(Optional) If magnetic separation of phagocytic APC following the trogocytosis assay is desired, 2.22 Âµm magnetic polystyrene beads can be added to cultures immediately prior to plating of APC (Step A1 above) at a final concentration of ~0.01% w/v. If using Spherotech beads as listed in the materials section, a recommended volume is 5 Âµl/well. The concentration needed will vary between APC type, and titrations should be performed to establish optimal concentrations prior to performing trogocytosis assays. If the number is too high, it may result in APC death due to over internalization. Visualize APC using a 10x objective on an inverted phase contrast microscope prior to the trogocytosis-assay, generally 4-10 beads/APC results in efficient magnetic separation. Bead diameter is between 1/10<sup>th</sup> and 1/4<sup>th</sup> the diameter of the cells and are very easily visualized. Alternatively, magnetic beads can be added 2-6 h prior to the trogocytosis assay, however overnight incubation typically yields in better results. Mix thoroughly before plating each well, as the magnetic beads rapidly settle to the bottom of tubes.<br/><br/></li></ol></li><li>Preparation of T cell blasts<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Pre-coat 6-well plates with 1 ml/well of PBS pH 7.4 containing 1 or 2 Âµg/ml of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Insure the entire surface of each well is covered with buffer by gently rotating the plate. We generally use red blood cell depleted splenic cultures as T cell source, but if using cultures of purified T cells, CD28 can be added at the time of T cell plating. For optimal coating of wells, seal plates with parafilm to minimize evaporation and incubate plates at 4 Â°C overnight. Coating can also be done by incubating plates at 37 Â°C for a minimum of 2 h, if preferred.<br/><em>Note: As an alternative to antibody coated wells, antibody-coated beads may be used, but we do not have experience with this technique. Soluble anti-CD3 is not recommended as it may result in anergy induction rather than activation (Smith </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 1997).</em> </li><li>Prior to addition of T cells to anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 coated wells, in a biosafety cabinet (tissue culture hood) remove the coating buffer and allow wells to completely dry.</li><li>Collect spleen(s) from donor animals and generate single cell suspensions via rupturing the capsule by gently grinding between the ground glass (labeling) section of sterile microscope slides. This is done in a sterile Petri dish and cells are liberated into approximately 10 ml cRPMI. The techniques necessary to collect spleens and prepare single cell spleen cell suspensions are described in Wetzel <em>et al.</em>, 2002 and 2005; Doherty <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Osborne and Wetzel, 2012; Thueson <em>et al.</em>, 2015.</li><li>Mix splenocytes thoroughly and filter debris through a 60 Âµm sterile Nitex screen or filter-top tube, or allow debris to settle to the bottom of the conical tube before transferring cell suspension to a new 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. If debris is not removed, cells in culture will stick to them, which may significantly reduce activation and/or cell recovery.</li><li>Lyse red blood cells (RBC) using Geyâs buffer. Resuspend cell pellet in 5 ml of Geyâs solution and incubate 5-10 min at room temperature or 5 min at 37 Â°C. Add an equal volume of cRPMI and centrifuge for 5 min at 500 <em>x g</em>. The resulting cell pellet should be an off-white color and may have a thin layer of red blood cells on the top. If the pellet is uniformly brick red (indicating insufficient RBC lysis), repeat this step.</li><li>If desired, purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can be generated by negative selection of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and other unwanted cell types at this time using your desired method. This is not necessary as with whole splenocyte cultures, typically &gt; 90% of the recovered viable cells after the Ab-stimulation period are T cells.</li><li>Adjust cell concentration to at 1.25 x 10<sup>6</sup> T cells, or 1.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> total splenocytes/ml in cRPMI.</li><li>Add 2 ml of cell suspension to each well of the pre-coated plates.</li><li>Incubate cells at 37 Â°C for 36-48 h. Check cells at 24 h and ensure the T cells are adhering to the bottom of the wells, which is consistent with activation. If T cells are floating and their cytoplasm are optically dense or crenated when viewed at 10x using an inverted microscope, the cells have not been activated and the experiment must terminated and subsequently restarted.</li><li>At 36-48 h, gently rinse the wells with the media in the well to remove cells from 6-well plates and place into new un-coated 6-well plates, or tissue culture flask in cRPMI.<br/><em>Note: If the media becomes acidic (i.e., phenol-red containing media turns yellow), add between 1/3 volume and an equal volume of fresh cRPMI to cultures. Do not add more than an equal volume of fresh media as critical cytokines such as IL-2 will be diluted out and cells will not continue to proliferate. Check media every 12-24 h until use in the trogocytosis-assay.</em> </li><li>Ab-generated blasts can be used 2-4 days after removal from antibody containing plates. Use prior to 2 days may result in higher levels of non-antigen specific trogocytosis due to a heightened state of activation in the T cells.</li><li>Immediately prior to use in the trogocytosis assay, remove dead cells from T cell cultures via density centrifugation using <u>room temperature</u> Lympholyte-M (which is optimal for mouse lymphocytes). </li><li>Resuspend the T cells at 0.5 x 10<sup>7</sup>-1 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in room temperature RPMI. To avoid cell clumping, serum-free media is recommended for this step. If cultures contain &lt; 2.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells, resuspend in 5 ml. Add 5 ml of the T cell culture into a 15 ml conical tube. Using a pipette gently underlay 5 ml of Lymphocyte-M below the T cells, being careful to avoid large bubbles, which can disrupt the T cell-Lympholyte interface.</li><li>Spin tubes containing cells underlayed with Lympholyte for 15 min at 1,000 <em>x g</em>. Approximately 85% of the viable lymphocytes are found at the mediaâLympholyte interface (the remainder are suspended in the media layer).

If non-adherent/dead APC are present at the time of T cell addition, T cells will stick to these clumps to form large aggregates. To remove non-adherent APC, gently wash wells containing APC 2x by running pre-warmed PBS pH 7.4 from top-to-bottom of wells held at a ~45 degree angle. Carefully aspirate buffer at bottom of wells. Vigorous washing may lead to dislodging of APC.<br/><em>Note: This step should be done carefully, but quickly as wells should not be allowed to fully dry.</em> </li><li>Gently add 2 ml of resuspended T cells (1.25 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) to APC, and place immediately in a 37 Â°C incubator containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Incubate <em>in vitro</em> T cell blasts with APC for 90 min. With T cell blasts we have observed T cell killing of APC by 120 min. For naÃ¯ve T cells, measurable trogocytosis was first observed at 3 h and after 24 h debris from dying APC can lead to false positive trogocytosis results, so it is recommended that the T be incubated with APC between 3-24 h, depending on desired experimental design.</li><li>Following the co-incubation, gently rinse the surface of the dish to remove non-adherent cells and collect in conical tubes. Wash cells in 10 ml cold PBS pH 7.4 for 5 min before centrifugation at 500 <em>x g</em> for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and pulse-vortex the cell pellet, and proceed with cell staining if cells are to be analyzed immediately.

If there are visible bead-containing APC present in the T cell suspension after the first magnetic separation, Step E2 must be repeated.

This can be tested by adding neutralizing antibodies to APC 30 min prior to, and during an </em><em>in vitro</em><em> trogocytosis-assay, with a 1:5 APC:T cell ratio.
