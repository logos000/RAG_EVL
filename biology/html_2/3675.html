            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have the potential to provide homogeneous cell populations of T cells that can be grown at a clinical scale and genetically engineered to meet specific clinical needs. OP9-DLL4, a stromal line ectopically expressing the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (DLL4) is used to support differentiation of PSCs to T-lymphocytes. This article outlines several protocols related to generation of T cells from human and non-human primate (NHP) PSCs, including initial hematopoietic differentiation of PSC on OP9 feeders or defined conditions, followed by coculture of the OP9-DLL4 cells with the PSC-derived hematopoietic progenitors (HPs), leading to efficient differentiation to T lymphocytes. In addition, we describe a protocol for robust T cell generation from hPSCs conditionally expressing ETS1. The presented protocols provide a platform for T cell production for disease modeling and evaluating their use for immunotherapy in large animal models.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>T lymphocyte (T cells) play a key role in cell-mediated immune responses and are involved in monitoring and killing tumor cells. Throughout the last decades, several strategies have been developed to redirect, culture and/or enhance T lymphocytes against cancer (Houot <em>et al.</em>, 2015; June <em>et al.</em>, 2018) and utilize them for T cell-based adoptive immunotherapies. Recent clinical trials have shown outstanding outcomes in relapsed and refractory lymphoma patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells (Riviere and Sadelain, 2017).<br/> <br/>Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic (hESCs) and induced (hiPSCs), provide a promising resource to produce T cells for adoptive cellular immunotherapies, which can be coupled with genetic engineering technologies to generate off-the-shelf supplies of CAR T cells. In addition, generating hPSCs from antigen (Ag)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and redifferentiating them into functional CTLs could enable the scalable production of rejuvenated CTLs (Minagawa and Kaneko, 2014; Kaneko, 2016). Several reports have demonstrated T cell generation from hPSCs (Nishimura <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Vizcardo <em>et al.</em>, 2013) and the feasibility of hiPSC based CAR T cell therapies (Themeli <em>et al.</em>, 2013). However, there is still a need to improve the efficacy of T cell generation and expansion from hPSCs. In addition, further advances in hPSC-based T cell therapies will require their preclinical evaluation in large animal models. Since macaques are physiologically and immunologically similar to humans, including possessing orthologous MHC genes (Adams <em>et al.</em>, 2001), and similarities in killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) with humans (Bimber <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Parham <em>et al.</em>, 2010), nonhuman primates (NHPs) will be the most appropriate model to address the therapeutic efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of PSC-derived T cells.<br/> <br/>Here, we describe an improved method for the derivation of T cells from human and NHP-PSCs with a higher efficiency and shorter time (as soon as 3 weeks) than existing protocols. Differentiation of T cells from hPSCs involves two major steps: induction of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPs) from hPSCs and their subsequent differentiation into T cells. Our lab previously reported well-established protocols on the induction of hematopoietic lineages from hPSCs on OP9 feeders and in defined feeder- and serum-free conditions (Vodyanik <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Vodyanik and Slukvin, 2007; Uenishi <em>et al.</em>, 2014). We showed that hemogenic progenitors from different stages of differentiation or different sources were cocultured on OP9-DLL4 to differentiate into T cells (Kumar <em>et al.</em>, 2019b). We have also reported a protocol for the induction of hematopoietic lineages from NHP-PSCs (D'Souza <em>et al.</em>, 2016). T cells differentiation from both hPSCs or NHP-PSCs proceeds through a CD5<sup>+</sup>CD7<sup>+</sup> progenitor stage that eventually transitions into CD8<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells. Altogether, the protocol used for the PSC-derived T cells presents a platform for T cell production to evaluate their utility for adoptive immunotherapies and preclinical testing in large animal models.<br/><br/><strong><u>Related Information</u></strong><br/><strong><em>Hematopoietic differentiation from human PSCs in an OP9 co-culture system</em></strong><br/>Hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs on mouse stromal OP9 feeders is performed in serum-containing medium without addition of any cytokines (Vodyanik <em>et al.</em>, 2005). In this system, hPSCs undergo stepwise progression toward APLNR<sup>+</sup>PDGFRÎ±<sup>+</sup> primitive posterior mesoderm with hemangioblast colony forming cells (HB-CFCs) that reflects primitive hematopoiesis, KDR<sup>hi</sup>PDGFRÎ±<sup>lo/-</sup>VEC<sup>-</sup> hematovascular mesodermal progenitors with definitive hematopoietic potential, immature VE-cadherin (VEC)<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup>CD73<sup>-</sup> HE, which specify into DLL4<sup>+</sup> arterial hemogenic endothelium (HE) with definitive hematopoietic potential, and DLL4<sup>-</sup> non-arterial-type HE with mostly primitive hematopoietic potential; and CD34<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors (HPs) that include CD43<sup>+</sup>CD235a<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>+/-</sup> HPs, enriched in erythromegakryocytic progenitors and CD43<sup>+</sup>CD235a/41a<sup>-</sup> multipotent HPs with a lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD90<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup> hematopoietic stem progenitor cells phenotype, and lymphomyeloid potential (Vodyanik <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Choi <em>et al.</em>, 2009a and 2009b; Choi <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Kumar <em>et al.</em>, 2019a and 2019b; Uenishi <em>et al.</em>, 2018) (Figure 1). CD43<sup>+</sup> HPs generated in this coculture can be collected on days 8-9 of differentiation and subsequently cultured on OP9-DLL4 in lymphoid conditions to generate T cells (Kumar <em>et al.</em>, 2019b). We also demonstrated that T cells can be generated directly from definitive hemogenic progenitors collected from earlier stages of development (hematovascular mesoderm or HE stage) and cultured in lymphoid conditions on OP9-DLL4 (Kumar <em>et al.</em>, 2019b).<br/>â<br/><em><strong>Hematopoietic differentiation from human PSCs in a chemically defined system</strong></em><br/>We have reported defined feeder- and serum-free conditions for generation of blood from hPSCs in chemically defined conditions. In this differentiation system, hPSCs follow stages of development similar to those described in hPSCs cocultured on OP9 feeders, including the formation of VE-Cadherin<sup>+</sup>CD73<sup>-</sup>CD235a/CD43<sup>-</sup> HE and CD34<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> HPs with myeloid and T lymphoid potential (Uenishi <em>et al.</em>, 2014) (Figure 1). We typically use collagen IV coated plates for differentiation in defined conditions to reduce cost. However, more expensive matrix Tenascin C can be used instead of collagen IV to improve hematopoietic differentiation and promote development of HPs with T cell potential in defined conditions (Uenishi <em>et al.</em>, 2014).<br/><br/><em><strong>Genetic engineering of Doxycycline-inducible iETS1 hPSCs</strong></em><br/>We have recently reported a protocol for the generation of conditional gene expression of ETS1 under tetracycline responsive element (TRE) promoter along with M2rtTA (reverse tetracycline transactivator) introduced into hPSCs using PiggyBac transposons (Jung <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Park <em>et al.</em>, 2018a and 2018b). In one vector ETS1 is downstream from the TREtight promoter, along with the zeocin resistance gene driven by the EF1Î± promoter, subcloned between the ends of 2 ITRs of the transposon vector. For easy detection of transgene expression upon addition of doxycycline to the culture, ETS1 is linked with Venus through a 2A self-cleaving peptide sequence. The second vector has the M2rtTA promoter linked with a puromycin resistance gene through a 2A peptide sequence subcloned between the ends of 2 ITRs. Using 2 different antibiotic genes facilitates the selection of clones that incorporate both vectors in a single step. The use of a two-vector system allows flexibility to adjust the TRE/M2rtTA ratio to achieve robust doxycycline dependent gene expression in hPSCs while limiting transgene leakage. hPSCs are cultured and then transfected on matrigel plates in mTeSR1 medium. Single hPSC colonies can be picked up from low-density cultures of cell populations (Park <em>et al.</em>, 2018a and 2018b).<br/><br/><em><strong>T cell production from iETS1 hPSCs</strong></em><br/>We have demonstrated that T cell production from hESCs can be increased through activation of the arterial program at the mesodermal stage of development by overexpression of the transcription factor ETS1. Hemogenic progenitors generated following induction of ETS1 were more than 100-fold enriched in T cell precursors as compared to control (Park <em>et al.</em>, 2018b). Doxycycline treatment of differentiation cultures from days 2 to 6, enhances the generation of CD34<sup>+</sup> HPs with lymphoid potential. HPs collected from day 9 of differentiation cultures in the presence of doxycycline can subsequently be differentiated into T cells in coculture with OP9-DLL4. Although T cell cultures from DOX- and DOX+ conditions generate a similar percentage of CD5<sup>+</sup>CD7<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, total numbers of T lymphocytes produced per 104 CD43<sup>+</sup> cells from DOX-treated cultures are dramatically (&gt; 8-fold) greater. <br/><br/><em><strong>Hematopoietic differentiation of NHP-PSCs on OP9 coculture</strong></em><br/>Although the defined serum and feeder-free differentiation system described above works well with hPSCs, it does not support efficient generation of CD34<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> HPs with T cell potential from NHP-PSCs. That is why we recommend to culture on OP9 feeders to induce efficient production of lymphoid progenitors from NHP-PSCs. OP9 coculture supports blood production from different NHP species, including ESCs and iPSCs derived from rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. However, in contrast to human PSCs, NHP-PCS/OP9 cocultures require addition of GSK3Î² inhibitor and VEGF to promote hemogenic mesoderm development and human hematopoietic cytokines to support blood development (D'Souza <em>et al.</em>, 2016) (Figure 2). Similar to human, NHP-PSC-derived HPs can be differentiated into T cells in coculture with OP9-DLL4 (D'Souza <em>et al.</em>, 2016).</p>

For hPSCs grown on vitronectin use E8, while for those grown on Matrigel use mTeSR1. For hPSCs gown on MEFs use PSC growth medium, while for NHP-PSCs grown on MEFs use NHP-PSC medium.</li><li>After collagenase treatment, hPSCs/NHP-PSCs colonies are loosely attached and can be collected by gentle pipetting. Do not use excessive mechanical force or scraping, which can provoke spontaneous differentiation.</li><li>If spontaneous differentiation of hPSCs/ NHP iPSCs occurs, differentiated colonies should be elimiÂ¬nated during the maintenance; observe PSCs every day before changing the medium. Mark differentiated colonies with an objective marker under the inverted microscope and aspirate marked areas using a glass Pasteur pipette while feeding PSCs with fresh medium.</li><li>Matrigel is temperature sensitive and should be kept on ice during handling. It is recommended to avoid freeze/thaw cycles by preparing 200 Î¼l aliquots for four 6-well plates and storing at -20 Â°C. Specific aliquot volumes vary by lot. Quickly dissolve each aliquot in 48 ml cold PBS and subsequently add 2 ml to each well of a 6-well plate. Incubate at least 1 h at room temperature or store overnight at 4 Â°C until ready to use. Matrigel-coated plates can be kept for several weeks at 4 Â°C.</li><li>Vitronectin is not temperature sensitive and can be thawed at room temperature. Dilute Vitronectin in 1x PBS to reach a final concentration of 10 Î¼g/ml (2 ml Vitronectin/50 ml 1x PBS) and gently mix by pipetting. Coat 1 ml/well of 6-well tissue-culture plate with diluted Vitronectin. Incubate for at least 1 h at room temperature before use. If it is not used immediately, the coated culture plate must be sealed and can be stored up to 1 week at 4 Â°C. Stored, coated culture plates must be brought to room temperature 30 min before cells are passaged.</li><li>hPSCs can be maintained under feeder-free conditions. For the OP9 coculture system, we always prefer to use hPSCs or NHP-iPSCs maintained on MEFs. hPSCs maintained under feeder-free conditions are used for hematopoietic differentiation under chemically defined feeder-free conditions. We observe substantial differences in the efficiency of hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs/NHP iPSCs maintained on MEFs or in feeder-free cultures in the OP9 coculture system.</li><li>We found that engineered iETS1 hPSCs retain undifferentiated morphology and efficient hematopoietic differentiation potential when maintained on Matrigel-coated plates. In contrast, cultures on vitronectin-coated plates, iETS1 cells do not exhibit uniform morphology and fail to differentiate efficiently.</li><li>It is essential to culture OP9/OP9-DLL4 on gelatin-coated plates to prevent spontaneous adipogenesis.</li><li>Human hematopoietic differentiation on OP9 coculture system prefers over-confluent OP9 (8-9 days) whereas NHP iPSCs hematopoietic differentiation on OP9 coculture system prefers 6-7 day old OP9 cultures.</li><li>Human hematopoietic differentiation in chemically defined conditions requires specific plating densities for optimal hematoendothelial differentiation. Human ESCs need to be plated around 7,500 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Harvesting, counting, and seeding of hPSCs on the Ten-C or CollV plate should be performed quickly as singularized hPSCs do not survive well until mixed with rock inhibitor and plated.</li><li>OP9-DLL4 cells should be split every 3-4 days for maintenance/expansion. Proper maintenance of OP9-DLL4 is most critical step for T cell differentiation. Our lab strictly uses the defined FBS without heat inactivation. Heat inactivation does not benefit culture but rather results in a higher adipogenic effect on OP9/OP9-DLL4.</li><li>We have found that different lots of HyClone-defined FBS provide relatively consistent effects on OP9-DLL4 maintenance and T cell differentiation without substantial adipogenesis. Results from other suppliers are more variable.</li><li>OP9-DLL4 cells should not get overconfluent as it reduces the T cell differentiation ability. Hence, it is always important to perform passages the cells before they get confluent, which is typically 3-4 days when cultured in an appropriate serum.</li><li>Cell density in initial HPs/OP9-DLL4 coculture may affect downstream differentiation. A very high number of HPs can cause rapid development of NK cells which could lead to rapid killing of OP9-DLL4 feeders and compromise T cell development.</li><li>Differentiating HPs on OP9-DLL4 may reach high density by the second week or earlier. If this occurs, split the cells onto fresh OP9-DLL4 plates. Around 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> T cells progenitors/well of 6-well plates are ideal for differentiation during the second or subsequent weeks. High density cultures may result in reduced T cell differentiation efficiency.</li><li>There is no strict rule of weekly passaging during T cell differentiation.
