            <h1>Immunohistochemical Staining of CD8Î± in Diabetic Mouse Kidney</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Immune cell infiltration, particularly cytotoxic CD8Î± lymphocyte infiltration, plays an important role in development of diabetic nephropathy. Although CD8Î± infiltration can be evaluated by its production of cytokines, its localization in the kidney is of particular importance. The current protocol describes CD8Î± immunostaining using a Vectastain ABC kit. This protocol works well with most commercially available antibodies, including CD8Î± antibodies in kidneys of diabetic mice.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a complication of diabetes, is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease. Pathological changes in DN are closely correlated with the degree of renal immune cell infiltration, particularly toxic CD8Î± lymphocyte infiltration. Therefore, a sensitive and reliable method to localize CD8Î± lymphocytes in the kidney will facilitate the research in diabetic nephropathy as well as other fields relating inflammation (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p>

With this protocol, CD8Î±-positive cells are primarily found in the interstitium of the kidney. The potential backgrounds and no-specific bindings are minimal. eNOS-/- <em>db/db</em> mice spontaneously develop diabetic nephropathy at 8 weeks of age. These mice were treated with erlotinib (an epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor) or vehicle (water) from 8 to 20 weeks of age. Six photos from each mouse are taken, and the average is used as CD8Î±-positive cell density form one mouse. The number of CD8a-positive cells in the kidneys is quantitated from 4 mice from vehicle treated eNOS-/- <em>db/db</em> mice and erlotinib treated eNOS-/- <em>db/db</em> mice (Figure 1).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="132" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190914/20190914015916_9913.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.
