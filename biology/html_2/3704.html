            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) is a member of the GPCR family that is important for various neurological functions and whose dysregulation causes many mental health disorders. Structural investigations of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R require the production of functionally active receptors expressed from eukaryotic cell cultures. In this protocol, we describe a step-by-step method to express and purify serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R using a baculoviral expression vector system in Sf9 cell cultures, derived from our work with the rat (matching Uniprot ID P14842) and human (matching Uniprot ID P28223) 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs. A unique feature of this method is the utilization of cell culture additives to infect cells at low multiplicity of infection, thereby using several fold less quantity of viral titer compared to prior methods without the additive. This protocol can be tweaked to selectively over-express glycosylated or non-glycosylated forms of the receptor by varying the post-infection harvest times.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Over the last decade structural investigations on GPCRs have surged due to development of methods for high yield expression of functionally active receptors (Granier and Kobilka, 2012). Among those, the serotonin GPCRs are a small but diverse set of receptors that play important roles in neuromodulation and their dysfunction is linked to a number of mental health disorders (Berger <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Of the many methods available employing eukaryotic hosts for protein expression, including yeast, insect and mammalian cells, the use of Sf9 cells to express GPCRs in conjunction with baculoviral expression system has emerged as a prominent one due to its high yield along with reliability (Saarenpaa <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Wiseman <em>et al.</em>, 2020). However, various methods continue to be developed to overcome the various drawbacks of existing methods. There is no uniform, single method to express all types of GPCRs with sufficiently high yield to enable structural studies. This is partly due to the diversity of these receptors as well as modifications needed in their sequences to enable crystallographic studies. The advent of high-resolution single particle cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) circumvents some of the stringent requirements for crystallization and is more amenable towards studies on native receptors. One critical requirement for existing methods using baculoviral expression in insect cells is to obtain a high titer viral stock, which is non-trivial in many cases. Moreover for protein production, infecting cells typically at multiplicities of infection ~1-5 requires the use of significant volumes of viral titer, which gets depleted over time. Using multiple batches of viral titers can increase batch-to-batch variability. Hence, methods that consume much smaller quantities of viral titer are strongly desired. In addition, the native forms of many GPCRs, including serotonin receptors, have extensive glycosylation which is not desirable in all situations. Thus, any method that can provide either predominantly glycosylated or non-glycosylated form of receptor, preferably by a simple change of protocol, is also desirable. Here, we describe a method to express and purify 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R using baculoviral expression system in Sf9 cells that requires minimal quantities of viral titers compared to existing methods and can select the extent of glycosylation by varying the post-infection harvest times. This protocol, based on prior work (Wacker <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Mahesh <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Mozumder <em>et al.</em>, 2020), has been standardized to prepare samples for high-resolution CryoEM structure determination and it is applicable to other GPCRs, membrane proteins and other soluble proteins employing a similar expression and purification strategy.</p>

5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs. The rat receptor (matching Uniprot ID P14842), sub-cloned from an earlier plasmid (Bhattacharyya <em>et al.</em>, 2006), was over-expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag. The human receptor (matching Uniprot ID P28223) was sub-cloned from a codon-optimized sequence, having a stabilizing mutation M182<sup>3.41</sup> W and expressed with FLAG and histidine tags in the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively. The procedure to express and purify functionally active 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R consists of the following steps: (A) Bacmid preparation, (B) Preparation of high-titer viral stock, (C) Expression of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R in Sf9 cell culture, (D) Purification of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R, and, (E) Radioligand binding assay.</p><ol class="npwone"><li>Bacmid preparation<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Add 2 Âµl of plasmid (50 ng/Âµl), containing the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R cloned into a pFastBac1 or pFastHT vector (containing a FLAG or histidine tag at the 5â² or 3â² end of the receptor) to 100 Âµl of <em>E. coli</em> DH10Bac cells on ice.</li><li>Mix gently, incubate for 30 min on ice and transfer to chilled electroporation cuvettes.

Manufacturer of the baculoviral titer kit (Expression Systems Inc) provides the control virus as well as an excel sheet for calculating the titers.</li><li>For radioligand binding assay, normalized data points should be fitted to one-site Specific binding model or one-siteâFit K<sub>i</sub> for saturation binding or competition binding assays, respectively using GraphPad Prism, v5.01.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti35012">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>The use of a control plasmid, expressing a different protein but using the same baculoviral vector expression system, is recommended as a positive control to detect expression of the target protein on a comparative basis. Cells without infection serve as negative control. Plasmids, expressing proteins GUS and CAT, are provided along with pFastBac1 and pFastBac-HT cloning vectors kits, respectively, and can be used in exactly the same way as the plasmid containing the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R.</li><li>Use of healthy Sf9 cells is critically important to the yield and reproducibility of the work. Typically, fast growing Sf9 cells with densities of 2-3 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml, doubling times of ~24 h and viability &gt; 95% were maintained strictly at 27 Â± 0.5 Â°C and shaking at 130 rpm. 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 Âµg/ml of streptomycin in ESF921 medium were used for all cultures, unless otherwise mentioned. For suspension cultures, infection can be verified by observing cells on a hemocytometer at regular intervals under an inverted microscope. Cells show enlargement during the initial 24 h, followed by lowering of growth (<em>i.e.</em>, increase of doubling time) and increased granularity in the 24-72 h time followed by progression to cell lysis and reduced cell viability after 72 h. Cell viability can be measured by Trypan blue assay. For plate cultures, cell detachment from plate surface would be increasingly observed in 24-72 h.</li><li>Even though smaller volume of baculovirus is needed with PBA additive, the use of high-titer (&gt; 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml) is recommended in absence of PBA. The transfection efficiency may be optimized, by varying the ratio of bacmid:cellfectin, to obtain higher titers of initial stocks, which may enable increasing the titer concentration upon subsequent passages.</li><li>Preparation of high-titer viral stock is usually an iterative process, and may require passaging the P0 and P1 stocks at various multiplicities-of-infections (MOI), ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 to increase viral titers, as well as selecting the optimal harvest times. The MOI is the ratio of plaque forming units (pfu) of virus particles/number of cells in culture. Typically, P2 stock will provide sufficient volume for protein production; however, if necessary, another passage may be done to obtain P3 stock. Higher passages are not recommended. Longer harvest times may lead to lowering of viral titer, possibly due to cell lysis; nonetheless, the harvest time may be optimized to select for the highest baculoviral titer.</li><li>For baculoviral titer estimation, the process has to be first calibrated using a control virus of <em>known</em> titer, provided in the Baculoviral titer kit. Volumes of P0 stock may be insufficient for titer estimation, hence titers of P1 and P2 should be measured, although an estimate of P0 stockâs titer is necessary to start the process (which can be taken as 10<sup>6</sup> pfu/ml). In addition to titer estimation using Baculoviral titer kit and flow cytometric method, it is also feasible to obtain viral titers using plaque assays, quantitative real-time PCR and observations of infected viable cell size (Janakiraman <em>et al.</em>, 2006).</li><li>The yield of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R is interdependent on the volume of PBA (up to ~10%), time of addition of PBA (18-30 h), the MOI of virus addition (0.001-20) and the post-infection harvest time (up to 2 weeks), in addition to various other factors like the culture volume and quality of Sf9 cells. Hence, it may be prudent to optimize these factors, especially if it is more economical to expend baculoviral stock and save PBA, or vice versa. Moreover, as noted previously (Mozumder <em>et al.</em>, 2020), the extent of glycosylation in cultures grown with PBA can be modulated by varying the post-infection harvest time. Hence the time of harvest may also be optimized to select the desirable amount of glycosylation, by running Western blot analysis of cell lysate from cultures grown over a range of post-infection harvest times (see Recipes 13-18 for suitable buffers for Western blotting).</li><li>Î±-iodoacetamide is added to block any free thiol groups with the goal to prevent protein aggregation by non-specific disulfide bonds (Milic and Veprintsev, 2015). The effect of Î±-iodoacetamide treatment may be optimized by varying the amount and duration of treatment, and may be avoided (or substituted with a suitable alternative reducing agent) if desired, especially for other proteins.</li><li>The amount of membrane protein for saturation binding assay is to be chosen to avoid ligand depletion effects, <em>i.e.</em>, the drop in ligand concentration after binding should be minimal (less than ~10% of total ligand concentration). Theoretical estimates of <em>B</em><sub>max</sub> , which provide the maximum number of binding sites (fmol) per mg of total protein (obtained by BCA assay), may be used to estimate the bound ligand, and hence ligand depleted, per reaction. Increase the reaction volume or reduce the protein used per reaction if ligand depletion is observed.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti35013">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>LB agar plate (for blue-white colony selection)<br/>25 g/L Luria Bertani Broth powder<br/>15 g/L Agar<br/>50 Âµg/ml kanamycin<br/>10 Âµg/ml tetracycline<br/>7 Âµg/ml gentamycin<br/>100 Âµg/ml of Bluo-gal<br/>40 Âµg/ml of IPTG</li><li>Sf9 cell culture medium<br/>ESF921 medium<br/>50 U/ml penicillin<br/>50 Âµg/ml of streptomycin</li><li>Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) pH 7.4<br/>10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub><br/>1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><br/>137 mM NaCl<br/>2.7 mM KCl</li><li>Hypotonic buffer<br/>10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)<br/>10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>20 mM KCl<br/>SIGMAFAST Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tabletâadd immediately before use</li><li>Hypertonic buffer<br/>10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)<br/>10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>20 mM KCl<br/>1 M NaCl<br/>SIGMAFAST Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tabletâadd immediately before use</li><li>Resuspension buffer<br/>10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)<br/>10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>20 mM KCl<br/>150 mM NaCl<br/>SIGMAFAST Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tabletâadd immediately before use</li><li>Solubilization buffer (to be used for 1:1 dilution)<br/><em>Note: For other dilutions, adjust concentrations of n-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltopyranoside and cholesteryl hemisuccinate to achieve final concentrations of 0.5% (w/v) and 0.2% (w/v), respectively.</em><br/>50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)<br/>150 mM NaCl<br/>1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltopyranoside<br/>0.4% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate<br/>SIGMAFAST Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet</li><li>Equilibration buffer (or binding buffer, matching the loading of protein into resin)<br/>30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)<br/>10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>20 mM KCl<br/>400 mM NaCl<br/>0.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltopyranoside<br/>0.2% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate</li><li>Wash buffer I<br/>50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)<br/>800 mM NaCl<br/>0.1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltopyranoside<br/>0.02% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate<br/>20 mM imidazole<br/>10% (v/v) glycerol</li><li>Wash buffer II<br/>50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)<br/>150 mM NaCl<br/>0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltopyranoside<br/>0.01% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate<br/>50 mM imidazole<br/>10% (v/v) glycerol</li><li>Elution buffer<br/>50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)<br/>150 mM NaCl<br/>0.05% (w/v) n-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltopyranoside<br/>0.01% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate<br/>250 mM imidazole<br/>10% (v/v) glycerol</li><li>Radioligand binding buffer<br/>50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)<br/>10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>0.1 mM EDTA</li><li>SDS-PAGE Running buffer<br/>25 mM Tris<br/>192 mM glycine<br/>0.1% SDS</li><li>Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining solution<br/>40% (v/v) Methanol<br/>10% (v/v) Glacial Acetic Acid<br/>1 g of Comassie Brilliant Blue</li><li>SDS-PAGE destaining solution<br/>40% (v/v) Methanol<br/>10% (v/v) Glacial Acetic Acid</li><li>Transfer buffer for Western blotting<br/>25 mM Tris<br/>192 mM glycine<br/>20% methanol</li><li>TBST buffer (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20)<br/>20 mM Tris, pH 7.5<br/>150 mM NaCl<br/>0.1% Tween 20</li><li>Blocking buffer<br/>5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in TBST buffer<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti35014">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">The authors thank Prof Amitabha Chattopadhyay and his group members for stimulating discussions on the project, Dr Mita Chatterjee Debnath for access to radioactive facility and Mr Tanmoy Dalui for flow cytometry data acquisition and analysis.
