            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Lipid rafts are distinct liquid-ordered domains of plasma membranes of most eukaryotic cells providing platform for signaling pathways. Lipid composition of rafts is critical for their structural integrity and for regulation of signaling pathways originating from rafts. Here we provide a protocol to isolate lipid rafts from cultured human and animal cells and comprehensively analyse their lipid composition.</p>
            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Lipid rafts, Lipids, Lipidomics, Cholesterol, Membrane</p>
            <h2>Background</h2><p>Lipid rafts are distinct cholesterol- and sphingomyelin-rich structures in cell membranes, immersed into liquid-disordered surrounding membrane (Lingwood and Simons, 2010). They provide a âsolidâ platform to spatially organize elements of various signaling pathways as well as exo- and endocytosis machineries. The functional properties of lipid rafts are determined by interaction between raft lipids and proteins. Changes in raft lipid composition, both physiological and pathological, have striking consequences for the activity of the pathways originating from rafts and represent an important and underappreciated layer of their regulation. Isolation of lipid rafts is complicated by their dynamic nature and heterogeneity. Methods of raft isolation based on their resistance to detergents have been consistently criticized (Gaus <em>et al.</em>, 2005). Here we describe a detergent-free method for isolating lipid rafts and establishing their lipid composition using comprehensive lipidomics analysis. One example of using this protocol has been recently published (Mukhamedova <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</p>

Several online resources by vendors are available as a introductory guide to the concepts and techniques (view <a href="https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/support/documents/a05296.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).<br/><br/>In lipidomics, liquid chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry is commonly used to screen hundreds of compounds in a single run. In particular, a technique using multiple reaction monitoring is widely used owing to their benefits to selectivity and sensitivity. However, the mass spectrometer can only perform a finite number of scans per given moment. Our lipidomics methodology uses liquid chorography to separate and elute lipids over a 15 min timeframe. By combining the known elution times of each lipid we can assign specific regions where a particular multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scan would take place. Together this would reduce the amount of time spent scanning unnecessary transitions and maximize the breadth of our methodology. A figure describing this is shown in Figure 2. A brief schematic of the described approach (Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry) is presented in Figures 3 and 4.<br/>The protocol in Section D describes an approach that identifies the specific elution time of lipids without prior knowledge.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="127" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701015810_7521.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 2. Utilizing scheduled MRMs to improve dwell time and reduce cycle time with reverse phase chromatography.</strong> Lipids elute at certain periods of the gradient prior to its ionization on the mass spectrometer (Figure 3). By capitalizing on this, certain scans only need to be carried out in particular time points when using schedule multiple reactions (Figure 4). This allows minimization of wasted scans where the lipid of interest does not elute. An example here is that at 15 min, only 2 scans are required (bottom) vs. 11 that is normally performed if unscheduled (top).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701015845_9087.jpg" width="116"/><br/><strong>Figure 3. Separation of lipid species by reverse phase chromatography.</strong> Under reverse phase conditions, lipids are separated predominately based on its polarity. More polar compounds such as acylcarnitines elute into the mass spectrometer first with the more water insoluble compounds (cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols) eluting last as the proportion of solvent B increases (up to 100%).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701015922_7998.jpg" width="259"/><br/><strong>Figure 4. Examining lipids using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.</strong> This particular workflow utilizes a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with MRMâs. MRMâs enable several experiments to take place at a given time. Each experiment has conditions that enable isolation of a particular mass at the first stage (precursor ion), followed by fragmentation (at a defined collision energy) and isolation and measurement of the fragment (product ion). Together, this enables some level of specificity when examining lipids of various sizes and classes and is the core of this particular protocol.<br/><br/><strong>Principle of Scheduled multiple reaction monitoring:</strong> <ol class="npwtwo"><li>Scheduled multiple reaction monitoring<br/>Multiple reaction monitoring settings:<ol class="npwthree"><li>Precursor (Q1) and product ions (Q3) are systematically generated based on the lipid classes. A summary of the conditions used is provided in Table 1.</li><li>The precursor transition for each lipid is developed by adding the mass of each lipid with its adduct mass, <em>i.e.</em>, PC (34:1) is generated by adding its exact mass (759.5778) with its adduct (+H, so 1.0073).</li><li>Targeted lipidomics analysis requires multiple reaction monitoring to maximize dwell time (the time allowed for the instrument to examine the precursor/product combination) while minimizing cycle time (the time it takes to perform all scans at a given time).</li><li>A high dwell time is necessary for good signal reproducibility and sensitivity. In general, a minimum of 2 milliseconds is required per transition on the Agilent 6490. To achieve this, relatively small scan windows (20-60 s) are provided for each transition depending on peak shape (narrow peaks require smaller windows). However, with small scan windows, there is a risk of not scanning the compound of interest due to retention time shift (usually from column ageing or solvent composition changes with evaporation <em>etc.</em>) thus it is essential that accurate and appropriate scan windows are set for each lipid of interest.</li><li>After column and solvent changeovers, a retention time-check is conducted, where the analysis is run with larger scan windows (thus reducing dwelling time but allowing visual alignment of each peak) and each transition is centered towards the MS peak of interest.</li></ol></li><li>Setting up correction factors<ol class="npwthree"><li>In instances where an appropriate internal standard is not available for a lipid or lipid class, an estimation of lipid concentration can be determined by generating an appropriate response factor.

Identification of compounds to determine retention time for method generation.</strong> Example of the retention differences between PC(34:1) and PC(34:2). Due the prevalence of <sup>13</sup>C in nature, approximately 1% of the signal will carry over to higher masses (<em>i.e.</em>, 758.6 into 759.6) and eventually overlap with the monoisotopic transition of other species. Isotopes need to be accounted for and avoided (names in red) when integrating and assigning retention times for each compound. PCâPhosphatidylcholine, SMâSphingomyelin.<br/><br/></li><li>Run the eluents of quality control sample as unscheduled (no retention time windows) on the mass spectrometer under the described chromatographic conditions. This will be used to determine the retention time (the time where a particular lipid elutes) for each lipid species. This retention time is used to assign a period where the mass spec performs a MRM experiment for the lipid of interest in conjunction with the known individual transitions (set of conditions with precursor ion mass, product ion mass and collision energy which are given in Table 1). The procedure is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. This will help in scheduling lipid-specific transitions in the mass spec in the final method for the sample run (Section E of the procedure).</li><li>Combine retention time data from the unscheduled runs of control quality sample for different lipid classes of interest into a single method. Assign retention windows dependent on peak width (as a rough guide, a 0.2 min chromatogram peak should have a window of about 0.7 min). This converts the unscheduled (time unrestricted) scans into scheduled (time dependent) scans. Figure 3 depicts an example of this.</li><li>Run each unscheduled method using the same gradient conditions. This is then used to assign a scan window for every given lipid of interest. For example, in Figure 5, PC(34:2) (top panel) would be assigned the retention time of 6.36. The final method would then have the transitions for PC(34:2) and a retention time specified. This is a separate run for each lipid class of interest. If everything was performed in into a single unscheduled run, we would be limited to 200 measurements. We opt here to run each class unscheduled, assign retention times and scan windows, and then merge them into a single method in the end for the true samples. This requires multiple injections of a single sample in the first instance.<br/><em>Note: Ensure that isotopic peaks are avoided. Isotopic peaks arise due to the existence of carbon-13 in nature at approximately 1.1% abundance. Lipids comprise of mostly carbon-12 with different species differing in masses of 1 to 2 Da. In certain situations, an extremely abundant lipid can appear over several mass ranges that overlap with the monoisotopic mass of other species. An example of PC(34:2) overlapping with PC(34:1) is shown in Figure 5. Chromatography allows for the separation of overlapping isotopic compounds.</em> </li><li>In the method, ensure divert valve is diverting the solvent front (typically the first 1.2 min, dependent on dead volume). Due to the large amount of iodixanol and non-volatile compounds in the final extract, failure to divert will lead to large signal variation over periods where multiple samples are run due to accumulation of these molecules on the mass spectrometer source.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol><strong>Settings:</strong> <ol class="npwtwo"><li>Agilent 1290 HPLC settings<br/>Autosampler set at 25 Â°C <br/>Column compartment set to 60 Â°C<br/>HPLC column used ZORBAX eclipse plus C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm 1.8 Î¼m, Agilent)<br/>Flow rate set to 0.4 ml/min</li><li>Mass spectrometry settings<br/>Gas temperature, 150 Â°C<br/>Gas flow rate 17 L/min<br/>Nebulizer 20 psi<br/>Sheath gas temperature 200 Â°C<br/>Capillary voltage 3,500 V <br/>Sheath gas flow 10 L/min<br/>Cycle time of 600 ms<br/>Q1 and Q3 isolation width is set to 0.7 amu (Unit resolution)<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Running the samples<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Thaw out glass vials containing extracted samples and let them sit at room temperature for 1 h.</li><li>Sonicate on the sonicator bath for 15 min and vortex.</li><li>Allow to rest at room temperature for 3 h.</li><li>Insert samples into the autosampler.</li><li>Insert a wash vial containing 50% butanol and 50% methanol, use this vial to wash the needle in between injections.</li><li>Proceed with running the samples with the developed method.
