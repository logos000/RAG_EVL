            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>T cells are one major cell type of the immune system that use their T cell antigen receptor (TCR) to bind and respond to foreign molecules derived from pathogens. The ligand-TCR interaction half-lives determine stimulation outcome. Until recently, scientists relied on mutating either the TCR or its ligands to investigate how varying TCR-ligand interaction durations impacted on T cell activation. Our newly created opto-ligand-TCR system allowed us to precisely and reversibly control ligand binding to the TCR by light illumination. This system uses phytochrome B (PhyB) tetramers as a light-regulated TCR ligand. PhyB can be photoconverted between a binding (ON) and non-binding (OFF) conformation by 660 nm and 740 nm light illumination, respectively. PhyB ON is able to bind to a synthetic TCR, generated by fusing the PhyB interacting factor (PIF) to the TCRÎ² chain. Switching PhyB to the OFF conformation disrupts this interaction. Sufficiently long binding of PhyB tetramers to the PIF-TCR led to T cell activation as measured by calcium influx. Here, we describe protocols for how to generate the tetrameric ligand for our opto-ligand-TCR system, how to measure ligand-TCR binding by flow cytometry and how to quantify T cell activation via calcium influx.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Life depends to a large extent on the precise spatial and temporal coordination of molecular events. This is particularly important in cellular decision processes, for which cells constantly interpret signals from their environment in order to decide how to respond. Due to the lack of appropriate approaches, the impact of kinetics and localization of signaling processes on cellular decisions is still not well understood. Now the emerging field of optogenetics enables to perform the experiments required to fill this knowledge gap (Kolar and Weber, 2017; Goglia and Toettcher, 2019). As an example, we use T cells stimulated via their T cell antigen receptor (TCR) in this protocol.<br/><br/>T cells are a crucial part of the adaptive immune system. Beyond their role in protecting the body from infections, T cells have recently gotten attention for their potential in cancer immunotherapy. Hence, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind T cell activation is highly wanted (Spear <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Using their TCR, T cells can sense foreign particles, such as viruses and bacteria. Those particles are recognized by the TCR in the form of pathogen-derived peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. These peptide-MHC conjugates serve as high affinity ligands for the TCR (Davis <em>et al.</em>, 1998). Importantly, self peptides derived from endogenous proteins are presented on MHC as well. Self peptide-MHCs also bind to the TCR, but with low affinity and thus do not result in activatory signaling. It is therefore clear that TCRs are able to distinguish between ligands of different affinity (Holler and Kranz, 2003) and it has been proposed that T cells are able to make this differentiation based on the ligand binding time to the TCR (McKeithan, 1995).<br/><br/>So far, the majority of T cell researchers used peptides with point mutations, presented on MHC to investigate the effect of varying ligand affinity (and indirectly binding time) on T cell activation (Matsui <em>et al.</em>, 1991 and 1994; Weber <em>et al.</em>, 1992; Sykulev <em>et al.</em>, 1994; Corr <em>et al.</em>, 1994; Lyons <em>et al.</em>, 1996; Daniels <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Alternative methods for changing ligand-TCR interaction time are the use of mutated superantigens (Andersen <em>et al.</em>, 2001) or the mutation of the TCR itself (Tan <em>et al.</em>, 2017) All those approaches have in common that they fail to exclusively manipulate the TCR-ligand binding time without affecting other properties of the binding event, such as on-rate, enthalpy, entropy, geometry of binding, Gibbs energy or ability to withstand forces.<br/><br/>To overcome these experimental restrictions we have developed the opto-ligand-TCR system (Yousefi <em>et al.</em>, 2019), by making use of the light-dependent interaction between phytochrome B (PhyB) and PhyB interacting factor (PIF) (Levskaya <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Toettcher <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Kolar and Weber, 2017). We chose the PhyB-PIF system as the optogenetic switch for our system, since it allows for active, light-dependent conformational changes in both directions on a timescale of milliseconds to seconds. On the basis of our expertise to engineer and work with TCRs (Minguet <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Swamy <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Baeuerle <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Schamel <em>et al.</em>, 2019), we fused a PIF optimized for the secretory pathway (PIF<sup>S</sup>) together with a monomeric green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the TCRÎ² chain. This synthetic GFP-PIF<sup>S</sup>-TCRÎ² was expressed as part of the complete TCR complex on the surface of Jurkat T cells (Figure 1). Biotinylated PhyB molecules were tetramerized via streptavidin and these PhyB tetramers (PhyBt) were used as multimeric TCR ligands. 660 nm light illumination of PhyB led to a switch to the PIF-binding ON state (usually referred to as Pfr state) and 740 nm illumination reverses PhyB to the non-binding OFF state (usually referred to as Pr state) (Mancinelli, 1994). Hence, our opto-ligand-TCR system enabled us to specifically control ligand binding times via light illumination using the same ligand-receptor pair and without introducing mutations to the TCR or its ligands.<br/><br/>Our novel system allows high spatiotemporal control over reversible ligand binding to the TCR. This unique feature of the opto-ligand-TCR system could enable researchers to locally or timely restrict ligand-receptor interaction. Fusing PIF to other receptors would allow to control ligand binding to those receptors as well, as we previously demonstrated for integrins (Baaske <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Further, our system could be used to investigate the signaling events that happen after ligand dissociation, which have been mostly neglected due to the lack of appropriate methods.<br/><br/> <img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200226/20200226232407_7640.jpg" width="250"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Scheme of the opto-ligand-TCR system.</strong> Phytochrome B (PhyB) tetramers can be switched between a binding ON and a non-binding OFF state via 660 nm or 740 nm light illumination, respectively. PhyBt ON are able to bind to Jurkat T cells expressing GFP-PIF<sup>S</sup>-TCR on the surface, thereby activating downstream signaling, part of which is the influx of calcium ions.</p>

Whenever the conformation of PhyB should not be changed, work under green safe light, which lies at the absorbance minimum of PhyB. White room light or sunlight has a similar effect as 660 nm illumination and converts PhyB to the ON state.</li><li>PhyB is sensitive to oxidation and therefore should be kept in a reducing buffer by for example degassing solutions and adding 0.5 mM TCEP, Î²-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. Whenever the experimental conditions prohibit the use of reducing agents, expect and monitor a decline in PhyB to PIF binding activity over the course of several hours.</li><li>Continuous 660 nm light illumination may prevent PhyBt from binding to the GFP-PIF<sup>S</sup>-TCR as described in Yousefi <em>et al.</em> (2019). Therefore, use either low 660 nm light intensities or pulsed illumination with dark periods in between. 660 nm light illumination of increasing intensity results in shorter PhyBt binding half-lives to the GFP-PIF<sup>S</sup>-TCR.</li><li>Due to the photobiology of PhyB, saturating illumination with our 660 nm light source resulted in 80% of the molecules in the PhyB ON state and 20% in the PhyB OFF state. Saturating illumination with our 740 nm light source gave 1% PhyB ON and 99% PhyB OFF. Different light sources with altering emission spectra will result in different PhyB ON:OFF ratios, for details see Smith <em>et al.</em> (2016).<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32000">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>10% NaN<sub>3<ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve NaN<sub>3</sub> in water</li><li>Store at room temperature</li></ol></sub> </li><li>5 M NaOH<ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve NaOH pellets in water by adding the pellets slowly to the water (exothermic reaction)</li><li>Store at room temperature</li></ol></li><li>0.5 M TCEP<ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve TCEP in degassed water</li><li>Adjust pH to 7.4 with 5 M NaOH</li><li>Store in 1 ml aliquots at -20 Â°C</li></ol></li><li>Protein buffer<ol class="npwthree"><li>PBS</li><li>Add 0.5 mM TCEP from 0.5 M stock solution</li><li>Run through 0.22 Âµm filter and degas</li><li>Do not store protein buffer, but always prepare freshly</li></ol></li><li>FACS buffer<ol class="npwthree"><li>PBS</li><li>1% FBS</li><li>0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub> (dilute from 10% stock)</li><li>Store at 4 Â°C</li></ol></li><li>Stimulation medium<ol class="npwthree"><li>RPMI</li><li>1% FBS</li><li>10 mM HEPES</li><li>Store at 4 Â°C</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32001">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">We thank Susan Lauw and Johannes Kaiser from the Signalhaus Robotics Facility for running of the robotics platform (INST 39/899â1 FUGG) to conduct the calcium experiment as well as Opto Biolabs for their customized illumination devices.
