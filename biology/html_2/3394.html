            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The purification of nucleic acids is one of the most common procedures employed in modern molecular biology laboratories. Typically, commercial column-based protocols are utilized to isolate DNA or RNA from various sources. However, these methods not only require specialized equipment, but are also extremely expensive for high-throughput applications. Although an elegant answer to this issue can be provided by paramagnetic beads, bead-based open-source protocols have been limited in the past. Here, we provide an easy to follow step-by-step manual for the synthesis of paramagnetic beads, as well as their functionalization with either a silica- or a carboxyl-surface that can be used to replace the commercial columns with self-made magnetic beads. Together with a variety of detailed protocols for their use in high-throughput nucleic acids extractions, this bead synthesis method forms the recently published open platform Bio-On-Magnetic-Beads (BOMB), which is available on PLOS Biology (Oberacker <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Updated protocols can be found on the associated webpage (<a href="https://bomb.bio" target="_blank">https://bomb.bio</a>).</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The ability to achieve solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) (DeAngelis <em>et al</em>., 1995) is one of the most useful characteristics of functionalized paramagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Together with their scalability and potential for automation, MNPs are ideal candidates for the development of high-throughput protocols regarding nucleic acid purification (Hawkins <em>et al</em>., 1994; DeAngelis <em>et al</em>., 1995; Rohland and Reich, 2012). The small nano- or microparticles are able to reversibly bind nucleic acids under dehydrating conditions and can be safely immobilized by a strong magnet during consecutive wash or manipulation steps. Bead-based protocols can be adapted easily for multi-well formats, allowing the processing of hundreds of samples simultaneously. Additionally, MNPs are very cost-effective as the beads can be obtained very cheaply, both commercially and self-made. Although their advantages over more established column-based methods are obvious, surprisingly little effort has been put in the development of open-source protocols featuring paramagnetic beads. <br/><br/>Protocols for the synthesis of ferrite nanoparticles have been published before (reviewed in Houshiar <em>et al</em>., 2014; Singh <em>et al</em>., 2014; Wu <em>et al</em>., 2015; Majidi <em>et al</em>., 2016). We adopted the commonly used co-precipitation method due to its efficient and robust performance and the fact that it does not require any specialized equipment (Choi <em>et al</em>., 2007). For this, a solution of FeCl<sub>2</sub> and FeCl<sub>3</sub> in a 1:2 molar ratio is prepared and slowly dripped into a preheated NaOH solution. This forms a black precipitate consisting of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> particles with an approximate diameter of 5 to 20 nm as judged by electron microscopy (Figure 1A). As oxygen is known to interfere with ferrite precipitation reactions, the NaOH solution should be degassed and/or preheated to 80 Â°C or higher before adding the iron solution. After the synthesis reaction, the nanoparticles are washed multiple times with deionized water. We recommend starting the respective coating reaction immediately after the synthesis as the particles are prone to oxidation. However, it is possible to stabilize them using various chemicals, such as detergents, sodium oleate or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (reviewed in Singh <em>et al</em>., 2014; Majidi <em>et al</em>., 2016). Upon lyophilization, the core MNPs can be stored in an air-tight container under inert atmosphere.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191014/20191014211622_4309.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

The silica deposition reaction outlined here is based on a modified version of the StÃ¶ber method (StÃ¶ber <em>et al</em>., 1968). It utilizes tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) which is hydrolyzed in a basic environment, leading to the deposition of a SiO<sub>2</sub> layer surrounding the paramagnetic core. Conveniently, the thickness of the silica coat, and therefore the size of the beads, can be controlled by the amount of TEOS added to the reaction (Kim <em>et al</em>., 2007), allowing a precise adjustment depending on the respective downstream application. The provided standard coating protocol yields silica-coated beads with an average diameter of approximately 400 nm (Figure 1B), which perform well for a wide range of nucleic acid purification and manipulation experiments from bacteria, mammalian cells, tissues (Figure 2) and many more (Oberacker <em>et al</em>., 2019).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191014/20191014211724_7180.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

Here, we use methacrylic acid (MAA) monomers, which form a layer of polymethacrylic acid (PMAA) around the ferrite core particles during a free-radical retrograde precipitation polymerization reaction (Aggarwal <em>et al</em>., 1996). Potentially, carboxyl- and silica-surfaces can be further modified to enable a broad range of additional functionalities to the paramagnetic beads.</p></p></p>

The resulting microscopy pictures are displayed in Figures 1C, 1D and 1E. A successful synthesis should yield predominantly single spherical beads which display paramagnetic properties and cluster when exposed to a strong magnetic field. It is also possible to assess further properties of the beads using X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), if this information is needed for the respective application. However, for standard applications such as nucleic acid extraction this is not necessary.<br/>We also recommend benchmarking the performance of the beads from each synthesis, and testing them if stored for a longer time. For this, we suggest titring the amount of beads and/or binding buffer in a clean-up of a DNA standard, as described in detail in BOMB protocol #4.1 (<a href="https://bomb.bio/protocols" target="_blank">https://bomb.bio/protocols</a>). Furthermore, we recommend comparing the results for each application to available commercial setups.
