            <h1>An Adjustable Protocol to Analyze Chemical Profiles of Non-sterile Rhizosphere Soil</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The analysis of chemical diversity in non-sterile rhizosphere soil has been a pressing methodological challenge for years. Rhizosphere-enriched chemicals (<em>i.e.</em>, rhizochemicals) include root exudation chemicals, (microbial) breakdown products thereof, and <em>de novo</em> produced metabolites by rhizosphere-inhabiting microbes, all of which can play an important role in plant-soil interactions. The power and resolution of analytical methods and statistical analysis pipelines allow for better acquisition, separation and identification of rhizochemicals, thus providing unprecedented insight into the biochemistry underpinning plant-soil interactions. The current protocol describes a recently developed method to characterize rhizochemical profiles from plants, including crops, and is modular and customizable, allowing for application across a range of different plant-soil combinations. The protocol provides in-depth details about the experimental system for sample collection, data acquisition by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and analytical pipeline, which statistically selects for rhizochemicals by statistical comparison between metabolite profiles from plant-containing soil and plant-free soil. Moreover, the optional addition of chemical standards permits a semi-targeted approach, which improves the annotation of chemical signatures and identification of single rhizochemicals.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Previous approaches to studying rhizosphere have often focused on sterile and hydroponic growth conditions (van Dam and Bouwmeester, 2016). These approaches limit our understanding of the multi-trophic nature of the rhizosphere, as they fail to provide information about (microbial) breakdown products of root exudation chemicals and <em>de novo</em> produced chemicals by rhizosphere-inhabiting microbes, even though these may drive plant-soil interactions in response to environmental change, such as pathogen attack or abiotic stress. The challenge arises from understanding and simplifying the complex, and often overwhelming, level of chemical diversity that originates from untargeted analyses of non-sterile soil (Figure 1). Nevertheless, untangling this diversity by identifying chemical networks, their origin and function, is critical for obtaining new insight into the ecology of a much under-explored area of plant and soil science. Although not without its caveats, recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) technology and statistical-analytical techniques permit powerful exploratory methods to uncover the chemistry of natural soils (PÃ©triacq <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Swenson <em>et al.</em>, 2015 and 2018). Such techniques are becoming increasingly accessible.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="118" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190516/20190516010954_1256.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Rhizochemicals that shape below-ground interactions.</strong> Rhizochemicals are compounds that are enriched in the rhizosphere and include a) root exudation chemicals, b) microbial breakdown products of root exudation chemicals, c) <em>de novo</em> synthesized metabolites by rhizosphere-inhabiting microbes. Rhizochemicals can have important signaling activities thereby shaping below-ground interactions between plants and soil microbes.<br/><br/>The protocol presented here describes an adjustable experimental system for sample collection and sample preparation, followed by data acquisition using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF). Subsequent statistical analysis allows separating chemical signatures by retention time and mass to charge (<em>m/z</em>) ratios between plant-free soil and plant-containing soil, which ultimately identifies profiles of rhizosphere-enriched chemical (<em>i.e.</em>, rhizochemicals). These profiles can be further annotated using chemical databases, such as METLIN (Smith <em>et al.</em>, 2005). Moreover, during mass spectrometry examination, running a library of relevant standards can increase the accuracy of this approach and allow focus of the analysis on specific metabolite classes. <br/><br/>The protocol outlined here, and originally used in PÃ©triacq <em>et al.</em> (2017), was initially developed for the analysis of rhizosphere chemistry in the model plant species <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> (<em>Arabidopsis</em>; Figures 2 and 3) and has been adapted for maize. For other plant species, a similar experimental design can be adapted and implemented, but method optimization is advised. Particularly, we recommend further optimization when insufficient separation is obtained between rhizochemical signatures from the plant-containing soil samples and the plant-free soil samples (see Figure 4). These adjustments involve <em>i</em>) testing different soils, <em>ii</em>) using different extraction solutions (<em>e.g.</em>, with varying MeOH concentrations), <em>iii</em>) increasing root biomass in collection tubes, <em>iv</em>) adjusting soil moisture, <em>v</em>) increasing the time of sample extraction from the collection tubes, and <em>vi</em>) varying MS settings. Further attention should be paid to the fact that extraction solutions with high MeOH concentrations can cause damage to microbial and/or root cells, in which case specific assays can be used to assess the extent of cell damage, as detailed in Petriacq <em>et al.</em> (2017). If cell damage occurs, we recommend using a lower MeOH concentration in the extraction solution and/or shorter extraction times. If insufficient sample yield is obtained with shorter extraction times, a pressurized collection system can be used, as is illustrated in Figure 2D.<br/></p>

Fit tubes with 40 mm<sup>2</sup> miracloth at the bottom to hold soil. Fill tube with desired soil matrix (~40 ml), for instance 9:1 (v/v) mixture of sand and dry compost (see Materials and Reagents for more information).<br/><em>Note: For larger plant species, such as 4-week-old maize seedlings, growing in clay agricultural soil, 50 ml Falcons were suitable with similar sized holes (Figure 2C).</em> </li><li>Pressurized lid (for larger Falcons) to aide in pushing the liquid through the growth tube (if necessary; Figure 2D).<br/>Create these lids by drilling a hole, smaller than the diameter of the syringe, and forcing the syringe through, securing with strong and watertight epoxy.

Analytical workflow for the identification of rhizosphere metabolites.</strong> Mass spectrometry data are processed using XCMS (Smith <em>et al.</em>, 2006) for peak identification (RT-<em>m/z</em> features) and alignment, grouping, and retention time (RT) correction, then checked for quality control and normalized (Median-centered, cube-root transformation and Pareto scaling). Metabolomics overview is given by principal component analysis (PCA), which is crucial to verify sufficient metabolomics separation between extracts from plant-containing and plant-free tubes. If the global differences are not convincing by PCA, the rhizosphere chemistry in the plant-containing soil might be too much diluted by bulk soil chemistry, and further adjustments of collection systems are necessary (<em>e.g.</em>, bigger plants, other soil, different extracting solutions, and longer sample extraction). In the specific case of binary comparison (plant-free versus plant-containing tubes), biomarker detection can be performed with S Plot obtained from (Orthogonal) Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (O)PLS-DA (Worley and Powers, 2013). This supervised technique provides Variable Important for the Projection (VIP) scores that reflect the discriminant statistical power of each variable for the PLS discriminant model. Ultimately, univariate statistical comparison via volcano plots (fold change vs. statistical significance) allows for straightforward identification of metabolic markers that are specific to the rhizosphere (<em>i.e.</em>, rhizochemicals). <br/><br/></li><li>Statistical analysis of MS data<br/>For this experimental set-up, the strength in identifying ârhizosphereâ chemical signatures comes from a combination of the experimental design, <em>i.e.</em>, free soil vs. planted soil, and the subsequent binary statistical comparison, obtained through a volcano plot showing statistical significance against biological significance. Further statistical tests (<em>e.g.</em>, ANOVA, <em>t</em>-tests with consideration for multiple comparisons, such as false discovery rateâFDR or Bonferroni corrections, where appropriate) can be used for the quantification and annotation of markers that are affected by the treatment. Such pipelines depend on the conditions used in the initial structure of the experiment and question being asked.<br/>  Prior to analysis, an appropriate normalization is required. Median-normalization, cube-root transformation and Pareto scaling of the data seem to perform best on metabolomics datasets (van den Berg <em>et al.</em>, 2006): the original structure of the dataset is conserved while the influence of peaks with high intensity is softened compared to peaks with low intensity.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Global differences in metabolic signals between treatment/point combinations can be visualized for anions (ESI<sup>-</sup>) and cations (ESI<sup>+</sup>) separately, or jointly where both datasets are concatenated, by principal component analysis (PCA), using MetaboAnalyst online (v. 3.0; <a href="http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.metaboanalyst.ca</a>; (Xia <em>et al.</em>, 2015) on median-normalized, cube-root-transformed and Pareto-scaled data.</li><li>For quantification of the number of ions showing quantitative differences between binary treatments (specifically the comparison between plant-free soil and plant-containing soil), volcano plots can be created on median normalized, Pareto-scaled and cube-root transformed data, with a cut-off value of &gt; 2 fold-change (Log<sub>2</sub> &gt; 1) and a statistically significant threshold of <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05 (Welchâs <em>t</em>-test; MetaboAnalyst). These markers can then be selected for identification. When a condition of ârhizosphereâ chemicals is screened against the corresponding soil, then volcano plots can deconstruct the markers that are specific to semiochemicals of the rhizosphere. When soil chemistry is the target, conventional heatmap or cluster analysis could be performed and the relevant markers further retained for subsequent analysis (such as ANOVA with subsequent Hierarchal clustering through Pearsonâs correlation (Williams <em>et al.</em>, 2018).
