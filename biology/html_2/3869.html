            <h1>Establishing an Adult Mouse Brain Hippocampal Organotypic Slice Culture System that Allows for Tracing and Pharmacological Manipulation of <em>ex vivo</em> Neurogenesis</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Steffen Mayerl, Charles ffrench-Constant</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>The function of the hippocampus depends on the process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis which underpins the exceptional neural plasticity of this structure, and is also frequently affected in CNS pathologies. Thus, manipulation of this process represents an important therapeutic goal. To identify potential strategies, organotypic adult brain slices are emerging as a valuable tool. Over the recent years, this methodology has been refined and here we present a combined protocol that brings together these refinements to enable long-term culture of adult hippocampal slices. We employ a sectioning technique that retains essential afferent inputs onto the hippocampus as well as serum-free culture conditions, so allowing an extended culture period. To sustain the neurogenic potential in the slices, we utilize the gliogenesis-inhibitor Indomethacin. Using EdU retention analysis enables us to assess the effects of pharmacological intervention on neurogenesis. With these improvements, we have established an easy and reliable method to study the effects of small molecules/drugs on proliferation and neuron formation <em>ex vivo</em> which will facilitate future discovery driven drug screenings.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>The hippocampus is a unique region of the brain with a high degree of plasticity as a result of the ongoing neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus throughout life. This process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis starts with the asymmetric division of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) that preserves the stem cell pool and generates progenitor cells poised for neuronal differentiation (Kempermann <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Anacker and Hen, 2017; Toda and Gage, 2018). These latter cells go through a well-defined sequence of distinct stages: NSC-generated transiently amplifying progenitor cells divide rapidly and give rise to neuroblasts. Neuroblasts are characterized by their expression of the immature neuronal marker Doublecortin (Dcx). They exit the cell cycle to differentiate into immature post-mitotic neurons that in addition to Dcx transiently express the Calcium-binding protein Calretinin as well as the neuronal marker NeuN. In the final step, these newly generated neurons migrate and integrate functionally into the existing neuronal network as mature granule cell neurons which cease to express Dcx and Calretinin, but maintain NeuN expression.<br/></p><p><br/>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays a fundamental role in physiological CNS functions such as memory consolidation and cognitive flexibility. Thus, not surprisingly, it is implicated in pathologies like Alzheimer’s disease, depression, or schizophrenia (Winner and Winkler, 2015; Anacker and Hen, 2017; Moreno-Jimenez <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Park, 2019) and therefore represents an important target for pharmaceutical intervention. However, drug testing is currently often based on cell culture systems that lack the complex architecture and connectivity of the intact brain (Pena, 2010; Humpel, 2015). On the other hand, drug testing in the intact brains of hundreds of animals is not practicable. Organotypic brain slices thus constitute a potential intermediate step as they maintain higher brain cyto-architecture and, as multiple sections can be obtained from one brain, enable comparison of different time points and/or drug concentrations with greatly reduced inter-animal variability. To study the effects of these drugs on neurogenesis, however, a reliable and easy lineage tracing approach is required.<br/></p><p><br/>Previously, Kim and colleagues established a protocol to culture adult mouse organotypic hippocampal slices for an extended period of four weeks by employing a serum-free culture medium (Kim <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Moreover, they introduced a Hibernate-A based dissection medium as an alternative to more complicated media that required constant gassing with CO<sub>2</sub>. However, they were unable to trace the fate of single cells, nor did their slices maintain the essential afferent connection to the entorhinal cortex. Kleine Borgmann and co-workers used a different sectioning approach to overcome the latter problem and employed retrovirus labelling to study lineage progression in the SGZ (Kleine Borgmann <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Here, we combined and refined these existing organotypic adult slice culture protocols. Moreover, we established EdU label tracing as a suitable read-out for neurogenesis. To circumvent the problem of a decreased neurogenic efficiency following a prolonged culture period, we utilized the Cyclooxygenase-inhibitor Indomethacin that has been shown before to reduce gliogenesis and exert protective effects on neurogenesis <em>in vivo</em> and <em>ex vivo</em> (Gerlach <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Hain <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Melo-Salas <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Finally, establishing proof of concept as to the value of this protocol we compared the effects of Silychristin, iopanoic acid, and BCH on neurogenesis. These drugs are small molecular inhibitors of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (Mct8), deiodinase type 2 (Dio2), and L-type amino acid transporters 1/2 (Lat 1/2) respectively–components of central thyroid hormone signalling. While neither iopanoic acid nor BCH treatment altered <em>ex vivo</em> neurogenesis, the number of new neurons was significantly reduced in Silychristin-treated cultures (Mayerl <em>et al.</em>, 2020).<br/></p><p><br/>Taken together, these improvements enabled us to establish a method that allows for i) an extended culture period of adult brain slices for at least three weeks with good neurogenic efficiency, ii) easy lineage tracing using EdU that also provides a defined and controlled starting point, and iii) pharmacological manipulation of <em>ex vivo</em> hippocampal neurogenesis. We believe that our advanced methodology will be useful for future drug screening approaches to sustain or improve hippocampal neurogenesis in various pathological conditions or physiological alterations such as ageing.</p><br/></p>

Flip the hemispheres onto these new cut surfaces and place them into an embedding mold on ice. Gently fill the mold with 4% low melting agarose and wait till it solidifies (Figure 1H). Trim the agarose block using a scalpel and glue it onto a vibratome tissue platform using super glue (Figure 1I). Hemispheres can be embedded, glued and cut separately or in parallel.

Depending on the focus of the analysis, one-way or two-way ANOVA may be required, <em>e.g.</em>, for longitudinal analysis of the same parameter such as proliferative capacity.

Whether this change in stiffness alters the quality of the sectioning process in comparison to standard methods of euthanasia such as cervical dislocation or decapitation has not been investigated and may be determined individually.</p></li><li><p>While extracting the brain from the skull be careful not to cut into the brain tissue. Smaller, superficial cuts do not compromise the procedure, but larger incisions will result in cutting problems and ultimately lead to fractured and unsuitable slices. If the latter happens, do not proceed. Likewise, when preparing brain hemispheres for sectioning, take care not to pierce the tissue while trying to hold it in place with forceps. Better to use a blunt spatula to fix the tissue for cutting with the scalpel. When removing a small part of the cortex at a 70Â° angle you should be able to perceive a small strip of white matter in the removed part (see Figure 1G). In a few cases, brain hemispheres may not be cut as desired and the slices may be damaged (for comparison see Figures 1K and 1L). Problems can include ripped, fractured sections, severing of the hippocampus-cortex connection and visibly unequal thickness over the slice. The latter is common if agarose penetrates underneath a hemisphere while solidifying. As a result, brain tissue will not be glued to the vibratome tissue platform and is free to move if pressure from the blade is applied. If problems occur during cutting our experience is that trouble-shooting possibilities are very limited. We recommend repeating the procedure with another animal instead of using damaged slices.</p></li><li><p>One of the major points that needs considering is the thickness of the slices thatâunlike neonatal slicesâdo not noticeably flatten over the culture period. Thus, the slices produce a pronounced background fluorescent intensity which will be a problem for some antibodies. In our hands, well-established, highly specific antibodies worked reliably, while other less specific antibodies did not give staining that could be used for quantifications or did not work at all. Moreover, we usually imaged on the day after mounting. Delayed imaging, however, may lead to the formation of air-filled gaps in the mounting medium that may dry out the sections. Thus, for longer storage before imaging sealing the coverslip e.g. with nail varnish constitutes a feasible option though we never further explored this possibility.</p></li><li><p>We never investigated whether the first block step (3% BSA in PBS) is sufficient and the second block step using 10% goat serum can be skipped. This likely depends on the performance of the antibodies employed.</p></li><li><p>Moreover, the protocol conditions are optimized for adult stem cells and neurons (hence using Hibernate A, Neurobasal A and Indomethacin) while they might be less efficient in keeping glia cells alive. Therefore, we do not recommend this protocol for the analysis of glia cells unless the culture conditions are further optimized.</p></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti39470">### Recipes</p><p>Following buffer recipes are based on Kim <em>et al.</em> (2013):</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>Dissection buffer (100 ml)</p><p>96 ml Hibernate A</p><p>2 ml B-27<sup>TM</sup> supplement (50x)</p><p>1 ml 200 mM L-Glutamine</p><p>1 ml Penicillin/Streptomycin</p></li><li><p>Serum-free slice culture medium (100 ml)</p><p>96 ml Neurobasal A</p><p>2 ml B-27<sup>TM</sup> supplement (50x)</p><p>1 ml 200 mM L-Glutamine</p><p>1 ml Penicillin/Streptomycin</p><p>80 Âµl 100 mM Indomethacin</p></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti39471">### Acknowledgments</p><p>This work was supported by a grant from the DFG to SM (MA7212/ 2-1), by a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator award (104783/Z/14/Z) and funding from the BBSRC (BB/L00402X/1) to CffC.
