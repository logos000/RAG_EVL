            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous structures that cells massively release in extracellular fluids. EVs are cargo of cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids that can work as a formidable source in liquid biopsy studies searching for disease biomarkers. We recently demonstrated that nickel-based isolation (NBI) is a valuable method for fast, efficient, and easy recovery of heterogeneous EVs from biological fluids. NBI exploits nickel cations to capture negatively charged vesicles. Then, a mix of balanced chelating agents elutes EVs while preserving their integrity and stability in solution. Here, we describe steps and quality controls to functionalize a matrix of agarose beads, obtain an efficient elution of EVs, and extract nucleic acids carried by them. We demonstrate the versatility of NBI method in isolating EVs from media of primary mouse astrocytes, from human blood, urine, and saliva processed in parallel, as well as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from cultured Gram-negative bacteria.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous membranous structures that cells release in the extracellular fluids. Besides the generation of apoptotic bodies, we now recognize at least two mechanisms that generate EVs, comprising the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in mature endosomes that fuse with the plasma membrane and discharge exosomes, and the direct release of membrane-budding vesicles known as microvesicles or ectosomes (van Niel <em>et al.</em>, 2018). EVs are increasingly referred to as intercellular communicators which are able to influence the metabolism of recipient cells through the horizontal exchange of different components such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013; Hirshman <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Jeppesen <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Besides the research efforts aiming to convert EVs into novel carriers of therapeutics, the incredible density and heterogeneity of EVs present in biological fluids hold promise for the interception of pathological conditions such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases (Schiera <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Bandu <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Latifkar <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Especially in cancer, this perspective is nowadays expanding the field of liquid biopsy tests, where the non-invasive detection of biomarkers through a systematic screening of circulating tumor cells, cell-free DNA, and EVs could advance early detection and monitoring, with novel opportunities for patientsâ stratification and prediction of disease progression.<br/> <br/>EVs have been detected in blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, tears, breast milk, as well as from cell culture media (LÃ¤sser <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Rolfo <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Salih <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Pieragostino <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Palviainen <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Multiple strategies have been presented to isolate them, with protocols based on differential ultracentrifugation, density gradient, or polymer precipitation, allowing for a massive enrichment of dimensionally heterogeneous vesicles depending on their size, buoyant density, or lipid structure (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Alternatively, immunocapture approaches have been exploited to enrich for EV sub-populations, virtually deriving from the same tissue of origin (Kowal <em>et al.</em>, 2016).<br/> <br/>In research laboratories, the most widely used method for EV isolation is the differential ultracentrifugation, in which large EVs of about 200-1,000 nm sediment at low speed (10,000 <em>x g</em>), while small EVs of about 50-200 nm pellet at high speed (100,000 <em>x g</em>), as described by ThÃ©ry <em>et al.</em>, 2006. This size-based classification cannot be exploited to infer the intracellular pathways of their biogenesis, as ectosomes generated by the outward budding of the plasma membrane can overlap in size with exosomes derived from the MVBs (multivesicular bodies). Nevertheless, specific tetraspanins (CD9, CD81, CD63) or lumen proteins (Alix, synthenin) are found to be enriched in the small EVs, including exosomes (Jeppesen <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Latifkar <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Ultracentrifugation has some drawbacks related to reproducibility of results when comparing different instruments/rotors, or to the physical force applied to balance yield <em>versus</em> integrity (Livshits <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Typically, this technique is combined with size-exclusion chromatography or floatation in Optiprep gradient to separate EVs from co-sedimenting protein aggregates (ThÃ©ry <em>et al.</em>, 2018). However, these approaches are inapplicable in view of a routine clinical practice, where the recovery of EVs needs to be fast and the biological sample not exposed to chemicals that could contribute experimental variability but interfere in downstream analysis. For these reasons, other microfluidic- or electromagnetic-based technologies that exploit other biophysical features of EVs have been implemented (Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The strategy of capturing EVs through electrostatic interactions (negative zeta potential values) has recently shown the advantages of rapidity and versatility in terms of device implementation, combination with other protocols like size-exclusion chromatography, and recovery of heterogeneous suspended vesicles (Petersen <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Heath <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>Here, we describe the procedure of nickel-based isolation (NBI) we recently developed as a low-cost and convenient method for isolating EVs (Notarangelo <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This method is based on nickel cations to capture EVs and on the use of chelating agents that synergistically elute vesicles in a physiological pH (or pH-controlled) solution. We demonstrated that NBI efficiently captures EVs and isolates them as non-aggregated vesicles in solution while preserving their integrity and minimizing the co-elution of exogenous protein contaminants (Notarangelo <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Importantly, NBI method is fast, scalable, and easy to apply, offering a valuable option for liquid biopsy investigations and EV preparations that could benefit from increased stability and a non-aggregated distribution in solution. We describe the procedure starting from the functionalization of a matrix of agarose beads with nickel ions, the steps for efficient elution, and the protocol we use to extract nucleic acids from eluted EVs. We show here the versatility of NBI method in isolating EVs from different biological fluids, including media from primary mouse astrocytes, human plasma, urine, and saliva processed in parallel, as well as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from cultured Gram-negative bacteria.</p>

Whilst the samples were similar in terms of oxygen (35.3% <em>vs</em> 37.4%), carbon (64.3% <em>vs</em> 59.8%), and nitrogen (present in EDTA; 0.4% <em>vs</em> 0.5%), the nickel content instead varied from stripped beads (undetected) and functionalized beads (2.3%).

Forty-eight hours before the collection, 36 ml of serum-free media were incubated with approximately 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells seeded (2 ml per well).
