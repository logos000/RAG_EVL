I published the article (https://bio-protocol.org/e2578) in 2017. In this paper, I was the corresponding authors and my name should be in the second position (senior author). I mistakenly put my name first. I thus would like to switch the order of the authorship with my student, Ms. Erin Elizabeth Koffman. Please see the new order below.<br/>The new Authorship: <strong>Erin Elizabeth Koffman and Jianyang Du*</strong>.<br/><br/>In addition, this work and the continued works were partially supported by NIH 5R01MH113986. We thus amend the acknowledgment part as follow:<br/><br/>We thank Thomas Moninger, Theresa Mayhew, and Sarah Horgen for assistance. We thank Drs. Susumu Tonegawa, Xu Liu, and Steve Ramirez for providing the TRE-mCherry plasmid and their previous works (Liu et al., 2012; Ramirez et al., 2013). JD is supported by the American Heart Association (15SDG25700054), the University of Toledo start-up fund and <strong>NIH 5R01MH113986</strong>.<p class="pptt">### References</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Koffman, E.
