            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Alveoli are the gas-exchange units of lung. The process of alveolar development, alveologenesis, is regulated by a complex network of signaling pathways that act on various cell types including alveolar type I and II epithelial cells, fibroblasts and the vascular endothelium. Dysregulated alveologenesis results in bronchopulmonary dysplasia in neonates and in adults, disrupted alveolar regeneration is associated with chronic lung diseases including COPD and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, visualizing alveologenesis is critical to understand lung homeostasis and for the development of effective therapies for incurable lung diseases. We have developed a technique to visualize alveologenesis in real-time using a combination of widefield microscopy and image deconvolution of precision-cut lung slices. Here, we describe this live imaging technique in step-by-step detail. This time-lapse imaging technique can be used to capture the dynamics of individual cells within tissue slices over a long time period (up to 16 h), with minimal loss of fluorescence or cell toxicity.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Prenatal and postnatal lung development is classified into several distinct stages beginning with budding from the foregut endoderm followed by branching morphogenesis, sacculation and alveologenesis within surrounding lung mesenchyme. This developmental process is tightly regulated by a well-orchestrated signaling programme and cellular components (Kotton and Morrisey, 2014; Akram <em>et al.</em>, 2016). The major function of the lungs is gas exchange, which occurs via diffusion (Herriges and Morrisey, 2014). This diffusion takes place between the thin cellular layers of alveolar epithelium and capillary endothelium (Roth-Kleiner and Post, 2005). Dysregulated alveologenesis is linked with a number of neonatal and infant diseases, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and pulmonary hypoplasia (Kreiger <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Hilgendorff <em>et al.</em>, 2014). In adults, alveolar damage is a component of several chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Currently, there are no curative treatments for these diseases other than lung transplantation (Warburton <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Madurga <em>et al.</em>, 2013; McGowan, 2014) and there is an unmet need to understand the mechanisms of alveologenesis in order to develop effective treatments.<br/><br/>In mice, sacculation begins around embryonic day 17.5 and is followed by alveologenesis, which begins within the first few days of postnatal life and is mostly completed in first month of life (Herriges and Morrisey, 2014). However, the most active phase of alveologenesis occurs in first two weeks of postnatal life with the majority of alveoli formed by postnatal day (P) 21 (Hind <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Snoeck, 2015).<br/><br/>Current understanding, based on static imaging experiments, is that alveologenesis occurs through repeated septation events that sub-divide primary air sacs to increase the number and surface area of alveoli (Amy <em>et al.</em>, 1977; Mund <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Real-time visualization of alveologenesis is challenging due to their location deep inside the body and the relatively slow duration of this process. A recent study used both <em>ex vivo</em> and <em>in vivo</em> live-imaging to study the sacculation stage of mouse lung development, immediately prior to alveologenesis, but these techniques are not suitable for imaging postnatal lungs (Poobalasingam <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>Precision cut lung slices (PCLS) contain intact alveoli and are increasingly used to study lung biology and disease pathogenesis (Meng <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Sanderson, 2011; Thornton <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Time-lapse imaging of PCLS has been used to show dynamic interactions of mesenchymal cells and macrophages with the extracellular matrix in adult normal and fibrotic mouse lungs, as well as in PCLS of human lungs (Burgstaller <em>et al.</em>, 2015). In addition, quantifiable <em>ex vivo</em> alveologenesis has been demonstrated in early postnatal mouse PCLS culture (Pieretti <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Using a combination of widefield microscopy and image deconvolution on postnatal mouse PCLS we have developed a method to capture the morphological mechanisms of alveologenesis in real-time (Akram <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Here we describe the detailed protocol for real-time live imaging of postnatal alveologenesis.</p>

Inject 25 Âµl of pentobarbital for P3, 50 Âµl for P7, 75 Âµl for P14 and 100 Âµl for adult mice using 29 G, 1 ml Insulin Syringes (Figure 1A7). Mice will die in 5-10 min after injection. Confirm death by exsanguination of femoral artery.</li><li>Place the mouse on a dissection tray in supine position. Spray 70% ethanol over the anterior aspect of the abdomen, chest and neck.</li><li>Using curved forceps (Figure 1A2) to pinch the skin from the anterior abdominal wall and gently pull it up, cut a small piece of skin leaving the inner peritoneum intact.</li><li>Using a pair of fine scissors (Figure 1A4) make a longitudinal incision along the midline of anterior abdomen and chest wall and extend it up to the chin (Figure 1B).</li><li>Using two pairs of curved forceps, retract the skin on both sides to expose the anterior aspects of the abdomen, chest wall and neck. (Figure 1Ci) (Video 1).</li><li>Using curved forceps carefully lift the peritoneal wall at the upper part of the abdomen, just below the costal margin and make a small opening using the tip of the fine scissors.</li><li>Extend the opening to the right and left using fine scissors. This will expose the diaphragm.</li><li>Gently lift the lower end of the sternum and make an opening on the upper part of diaphragm using the tip of the fine scissors. Then extend the opening to both side of the diaphragm along the inner surface of the costal margins (Figure 1C i, ii, yellow dotted line). At this stage you will be able to see pale pink colored right and left collapsed lungs (Figure 1C iii, arrow).</li><li>Lift the chest wall by holding the lower end of the sternum with curved forceps and carefully make a parasternal incision (to the left and right) to separate anterior chest wall from the body (Figure 1C i, iii, yellow dotted line) (Video 1).</li><li>Using curved forceps and fine scissors, remove muscle and fascia from the anterior and lateral aspects of the neck wall.</li><li>Using curved forceps, make an opening between the posterior aspect of the trachea and the anterior wall of the esophagus at the midpoint of the neck (Video 1).</li><li>Insert a piece of sterile suture through the opening and place it perpendicular to the trachea at its midpoint (Figure 1).</li><li>Make a small opening in the anterior wall of the trachea just below the cricoid cartilage using fine tipped straight spring scissors (Figure 1A, (6), 1C (iii) yellow arrow, Figure 1D (ii) inset).</li><li>Carefully insert a rigid metallic cannula 25 G for P3, 23 G for P7 and 21 G for P14 and adult mice through the trachea up to a millimeter above the bifurcation of the principal bronchi and fix in place with a suture (Figure 1C (iv) and 1D (ii) inset). The suture was tied, with moderate tightness, around the trachea including cannula inside, by applying two knots.</li><li>After cannulation, inflate the lungs by gently injecting 1.5% low-melting-point agarose prepared with HBSS/HEPES buffer warmed to 37 Â°C (see Recipes). Use a 5 ml syringe to instill the agarose and keep the syringe attached to the cannula until the agarose solidifies. Inflate both lungs keeping them <em>in situ</em> within the chest cavity using 0.2 ml for P3, 0.275 ml for P7, 0.35 ml for P14 and 1 ml for adult lungs. These volumes enable the lungs to be fully inflated without hyper- or sub-optimal inflation (Figures 1C and 1D).</li><li>After inflation, place a piece of double layered laboratory blue roll over the exposed chest wall and put some wet ice on to the blue roll to solidify the agarose.<br/><em>Note: Depending on mouse age, this will take 1 to 2 min.</em> </li><li>Remove the cannula by gently pulling it out from the trachea and tighten the suture knot.</li><li>Excise the trachea from its upper (mouth) end. Lift the trachea by holding the free ends of the suture and gently remove the entire heart and lungs from the chest cavity (Figures 1C and 1D).</li><li>Immerse the whole heart and lungs in ice-cold serum-free DMEM (SF-DMEM) in a 50 ml centrifuge tube, secure the cap and store on wet ice until slicing. The tissue can be kept on ice for 2-3 h.<br/><br/><!--video3403-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3403-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3403-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3403/3403-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.

Attach vibratome blade to the blade holder using super glue and leave to dry. Sterilize specimen holder and specimen tube using 70% ethanol spray and air dry. Place the syringe chilling block in -20 Â°C freezer for 15-30 min to cool it down prior to use (Figure 2B).</li><li>Have ready approximately 30 ml of 1.5% agarose gel made with HBSS/HEPES at 37 Â°C temp. Prepare 200 ml of sterile ice cold 1x HBSS/HEPES buffer and keep on ice. Prepare a 24-well plate with 1 ml ice cold, sterile SF-DMEM per well and keep on ice.</li><li>In a 10 cm diameter Petri dish, separate the left lung lobe from the left bronchus using a scalpel blade (Figures 2C and 2D).</li><li>Excise a tiny section of tissue from the basal end of the lung using the scalpel blade (Figure 2D; outline of the tissue excised is marked with dotted line).<br/><em>Note: This helps the lobe to sit on the specimen holder vertically.</em> </li><li>Place the lung lobe on a piece of clean laboratory blue roll to soak up excess media (Figure 2D).</li><li>Place a tiny drop of super glue onto the cutting end of the specimen holder (Figure 2Ei) and gently place the cut end of the lung lobe onto the glue drop, hold it vertically with curved forceps until the lung lobe tightly adheres to the specimen holder (Figure 2Eii).<br/><em>Note: It takes 15-30 s to attach the lung lobe onto the specimen holder.</em> </li><li>Insert the specimen holder into the metal specimen tube, hold it vertically keeping the lung lobe inside the tube and facing vertically up (Figure 2Eiii).</li><li>Using a 5 ml syringe, fill the specimen tube with 37 Â°C warm 1.5% agarose so that the entire lobe is submerged in agarose (Figure 2Eiii).</li><li>Place the cold syringe chilling block (Figure 2B) around the specimen tube and hold it in place until the agarose tissue block solidifies (Figure 2Eiv). <br/><em>Note: It takes about a minute to solidify the agarose.</em> </li><li>Insert the specimen tube into the buffer tray and align blade and cutting end of the agarose tissue block.</li><li>Fill the buffer tray with ice cold HBSS/HEPES buffer. Set the desired thickness of tissue slices to 300 Âµm. Set the cutting speed to number 5 and cutting oscillation frequency to 5. Operate the vibratome in âcontinuous modeâ.</li><li>Start collecting transverse precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). Remove the lung slices from the first 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the lung lobe from the buffer tray using a small metallic spatula. Collect the slices from the middle 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the lobe and place them in the wells of a 24-well plate containing ice cold SF-DMEM (Figure 2F). The middle third of the lung lobe provides almost equal sized slices. Take 1 lung slice in each well in 1 ml media. (Using this technique, a P3 left lung provides 12 slices and an adult lung provides approximately 36 slices.)<br/><em>Note: It is important to use equal sized slices for imaging and metabolic assays, the remaining slices can be used for additional assays, </em><em>e.g.</em><em>, immunostaining, protein or RNA extraction.</em> </li><li>Incubate PCLS at 37 Â°C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 2 h and then wash twice with warm SF-DMEM to remove excess agarose from around the tissue in sterile conditions, under the flow hood. <br/><em>Note: Some agarose will remain in the airspaces within the lungs and this is important to retain lung architecture during culture.</em> </li><li>Incubate the PCLS for a further 1 h in SF-DMEM at 37 Â°C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. From this point the PCLS are ready for live imaging and further experimentation.<br/><em>Note: Use the samples immediately for imaging (and migration analysis); but slices can be kept in culture overnight for other experimentation.</em> </li></ol><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Live cell imaging of lung alveologenesis<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Label-free, bright-field live imaging<br/>To visualize gross structural changes in lung slices over time, live bright-filed imaging can be performed as follows:<ol class="npwthree"><li>Use phenol red-free DMEM and ibidi 24-well Î¼-plate for live imaging.</li><li>Prepare transwells for imaging: using scissors cut and remove the rim of the transwell so that the transwell filter comes into contact with the lung slice at the bottom of the well (Figure 2G).
