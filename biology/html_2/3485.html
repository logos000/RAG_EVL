            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Research on exploratory behavior plays a key part in behavioral science. Studying exploratory behavior of laboratory rodents may provide important data about many developmental and neurobiological processes occurring in animal ontogenesis. The proposed protocol for measuring the free (low-stress) exploration behavior in rats is straightforward, requires minimal resources and very little animal training. It can therefore be broadly applied to studying animal cognition, animal behavior in general, the aging processes, and several animal models of various phenomena.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Research on exploratory behavior is an important part of behavioral science. One of the main goals of this research is to gain a better understanding of the process of adaptation to novelty introduced to a familiar environment or novelty of an unfamiliar environment. Encounters with a novel object or place are crucial for animal survival. They can bring new opportunities or pose a threat. An individual can adapt to the change or try to cope with it in a different way. Specific reactions to novelty depend on the type and characteristics of the novel stimulus and constitute multi-level processes. A high intensity of the stimulus or its biological significance (<em>e.g.</em>, food or predator) usually trigger stereotypical responses called âspecies-specific defense responsesâ (SSDR), such as freezing, separating the tail from the body (lizards), burying, spreading putrid odor, or flight (see Fanselow and De Oca, 1998, for an extensive review). Reactions to low-intensity stimuli (<em>e.g.</em>, stimuli which are not crucial for survival) are less easily observed. However, they are not less important, since they form the core of behavioral repertoire in many species. One may hypothesize that, since the organism does not deal with this class of stimuli by relying on reflexes, the process seems to occur at a higher organization level, similarly to cognitive or pre-cognitive processes. It is therefore important to understand these behavior regulation mechanisms at various levels of organization, and, consequently, apply methods allowing the researcher to measure behavioral activity in its full complexity. Our protocol, described below, was designed to address the postulate of low-stress testing environment for animals, therefore enabling them to express the whole variety of behavioral repertoire.<br/><br/>Most studies conducted to date involve some form of spatial rearrangement of physical objects or introduction of novel objects in an open field or in the animalâs homecage (Calhoun, 1962; Renner and Seltzer, 1991; Picq and Dhenain, 1998; Gouteux <em>et al.</em>, 1999). Our protocol replicates this arrangement, but with some notable improvements.<br/><br/>We propose a protocol and equipment suitable for measuring free exploration in small laboratory mammals (<em>e.g.</em>, rat, mouse, opossum) in conditions ensuring low levels of stress in individuals involved in the experiment. The aim of the proposed protocol is to analyze the new environment exploration, the rate of habituation to it, and the response to the innocuous and low-intensity novelty into a well-known context, in the rat. During the experiment, the animal is allowed to explore the test arena but is not forced to leave the safe area (transporter). What is more, the experimental chamber creates an opportunity to explore various zones both in the horizontal and in the vertical plane.<br/><br/>The proposed equipment and procedure are suitable for various small mammals. However, laboratory rat is the most common species used in exploration studies, due to its high sensitivity to novelty. The initial version of the procedure was applied in a study conducted on RHA/RLA rats (Pisula, 2003) and most recently on Lister Hooded rats (Pisula <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</p>

In our experiments we used a custom made transporter constructed with two overlapping hard PVC tubes. Lifting the middle tube (with a string) reveals the entrance cut out in the outer tube. It is used to standardize the procedure and ensure the minimum stress level caused by human handling during the experiment. The transporter should be equipped with a pull-up door/gate. The gate must be left open during the whole trial in order to allow (but not force) the animal to leave the transporter or stay in it. It should be noted however, that any other similar solutions may be applied<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200108/20200108041901_5480.jpg" width="59"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

The chamber is divided into three zones (A, B and C) which have been separated by two walls running perpendicularly to its longer side. The front and the top of the chamber are made of transparent walls that can be lifted to gain full access to the test arena. The wooden division walls between the zones have triangular entrances (120 mm x 140 mm) at the bottom, which enables the animals to move freely between the chamber parts. Dividers are placed at an angle, so as to prevent blind spots in the video recording from the top and from the front. The entrance to the chamber is placed in the central zone (A). The remaining zones, B and C, are where the objects allowing experimental manipulations are placed. In our recent studies (<em>e.g.</em>, Pisula <em>et al.</em>, 2019), we used wooden tunnels for this purpose (length = 240 mm, width = 120 mm, height = 80 mm). The entire chamber is covered with a layer of washable varnish. Wooden tunnels are covered with washable paint</li><li>Tunnels (Figure 2)<br/>In contrast to the most frequently used two-dimensional experimental settings, these tunnels provide a complex three-dimensional environment. In our experiments we used tunnels (200 mm x 120 mm x 80 mm) made of hardwood covered with washable paint. The tunnels are placed in zones B and C. The configuration of the tunnels is changed in one of the chamber zones before the first test trial and this change introduces novelty to the experimental plan. Tunnel configuration is changed by manually moving them or adding/subtracting tunnels in two zones of the chambers<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200108/20200108041915_2037.jpg" width="115"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

Based on our experience from previous studies, we recommend that the habituation phase should be repeated each day for 7 days (one 7-min trial per day). The analysis of the behavior of many rat strains and laboratory short-tailed opossums, makes us confident that the animals achieve full familiarization with the test environment after completing this habituation plan.</li><li>During the test phase of the experiment, measure the activity of the animals in the zone where the configuration of objects has been modified. Repeat the test procedure at least three times. This enables a repeated measures analysis across both the habituation and the test trials. The standard plan of the experiment would therefore comprise seven habituation trials and three trials involving experimental manipulation.</li><li>To avoid the confounding effect of lateralisation or visual/auditory cues, novelty should be introduced in the right chamber zone for half of the rats tested, and in the left chamber zone for the remaining half (<em>e.g.</em>, a mirror image of the right part of Figure 4).<br/><em>Important: If any animal shows an excessive right or left zone bias/preference during the habituation phase of the experiment, we strongly recommend excluding this individual from the successive trials.</em> </li><li>This Protocol for measuring free (low-stress) exploration may be used in various forms and variants. Depending on the research question experimenters may prefer to use visual, olfactory or tactile characteristics of the novel stimulus. The experimental chamber may be easily adjusted to serve these purposes. The objects placed in the chamber zones may be manipulated, so as to decrease and increase environmental complexity or change the properties of the novel stimulus.</li><li>The experimental plan is based primarily on repeated measurements. This characteristic brings many benefits but sets several requirements as well. Firstly, it is essential to mark the low-stress individuals in order to code consecutive measurements correctly. Secondly, statistical methods need to be suitable for analyses involving within-subject effects (repeated measurements) and between-subject analyses (various manipulations).<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30994">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">The initial version of the protocol was applied in a study on RHA/RLA rats (Pisula, 2003).
