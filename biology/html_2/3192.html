            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In the study of neurodegenerative diseases, it is imperative to study the cellular and molecular changes associated with pathogenesis in the relevant cell type, central nervous system neurons. The unique compartmentalized morphology and bioenergetic needs of primary neurons present complications for their study in culture. Recent microculture techniques utilizing microfluidic culture devices allows for environmental separation and analysis of neuronal cell bodies and neurites in culture. Here, we present our protocol for culture of primary neurons in microfluidic devices and their chronic treatment with the Parkinsonâs disease (PD) relevant toxicant rotenone. In addition, we present a method for reuse of devices for culture. This culture methodology presents advantages for evaluating early pathogenic cellular and molecular changes in neurons in a compartment-specific manner. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Studying primary neurons <em>in vitro</em> has long presented challenges due to the unique, diverse morphologies of neurons, and due to neuronal culturing requirements (Millet and Gillette, 2012). Neurons exhibit a unique compartmentalized morphology, with the soma, dendrites, and axons all exhibiting compartment-specific biochemical needs (Van Laar and Berman, 2013). Studying these different microenvironments objectively via large-scale approaches or high-throughput methods can be difficult under traditional plate culture, as cell bodies and neurites growing in proximity often cross, overlap, and functionally connect with one another. The development of microculturing methods incorporating microchannels to restrict cell movement and permit neurite outgrowth has allowed for the culturing of neurons in a manner that environmentally separates axonal and dendritic neurite projections from their cell body, or soma (Millet and Gillette, 2012; Taylor <em>et al.</em>, 2003). This innovation permits cellular compartment-specific analyses of neuronal development, biochemistry, and effects of treatments (<em>e.g.</em>, treating the axons with a drug or toxicant, but not the soma) (Taylor <em>et al.</em>, 2005 and 2015; Park <em>et al.</em>, 2006). The commercial availability of such devices now allows for uniform, large-scale studies into comparisons of the axonal environment and the somal environment.<br/><br/>By allowing for prolonged, healthy culture of primary neurons while isolating the microenvironments of the differing cellular compartments, these devices have become essential tools for studies that examine morphological-compartment specific development, senescence, or, in the case of our previous study, chronic drug exposure (Van Laar <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>Here, we present our detailed protocol for preparation of embryonic rat primary cortical neurons (Arnold <em>et al.</em>, 2011; adapted from Ghosh and Greenberg, 1995), culturing the neurons in Xona Microfluidics<sup>Â®</sup> brand microfluidic culture devices, and chronically treating the neurons with sublethal levels of the PD-relevant toxicant rotenone, as described in our recent publication in Van Laar <em>et al.</em> (2018). Our microfluidic device plating protocol, adapted from work originally presented by Park <em>et al.</em> (2006), provides details to (1) better ensure isolation of the soma from the axonal compartment side during the initial plating and (2) to promote neuronal health during prolonged culturing and treatment requiring media changes. We also present our protocol for the cleaning and reuse of microfluidic culture devices. This helps prevent the waste of devices in the event that initial platings of neuronal cultures fail to thrive or are otherwise unusable for experimental analyses. <br/></p>

Schematic of fixing neurons in the microfluidic device</strong> </li><br/><li>Reusing microfluidic devices<br/>In the event that a culture dies before experimental treatments begin, the device was not appropriately mounted and cells entered the non-cell-body side of the device, or the culture is otherwise unusable for experiments, we have found that the device can be reused successfully. Do not reuse devices that have been exposed to experimental treatments, such as drugs or toxicants (see Notes). Starting from a mounted microfluidic device with an active culture, follow the following steps for device reuse:<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Remove the media from the device reservoirs using a pipette. </li><li>Place a finger on the corner of the coverslip, then use forceps to gently grip the edge of the device at a reservoir and gently pull up at an angle until the device is free from the coverslip.</li><li>Rinse the device gently with distilled water, then place groove-side-up in a Petri dish.</li><li>Submerge the device in 1x RBS detergent solution. Cover the dish, and gently agitate on a shaker overnight at room temperature.</li><li>Remove the RBS detergent and wash the device using culture grade water 3 x for 1 h each, with gently agitation on a shaker at room temperature.</li><li>After the final wash, with the device still submerged in water, examine the device under a light microscope to verify that all cellular debris has been removed from the reservoirs and grooves.</li><li>Remove the final wash, and carry out the remaining procedure in a sterile culture hood.</li><li>Transfer the device, groove side up, to a sterile Petri dish, then submerge the device in sterile culture grade water. Cover the dish, and gently agitate on a shaker overnight at room temperature.</li><li>In the sterile culture hood, remove the device from the sterile wash and either air dry in a sterile culture dish to store for future use, or carry out the sterilization procedure as listed above under Step C2 for immediate use.</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27217">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz">Prior to use for experiments, data acquisition, and data analyses, carefully examine the devices and culture quality. Device cultures in which the cells appear in obvious distress prior to treatments should not be used for experiments or further analyses. Despite the design of the devices being such that cells should not be able to cross the microchannels, some cells occasionally do cross the microchannels. Glia in particular are able to readily cross. An occasional neuronal soma is not a concern. If after a week of culture you notice there are large populations of neuron somata in the axonal side, discontinue use of this device culture. If after your experiment you notice many somata on the axonal side, do not use this device culture for data analyses. Large numbers of somata on the axonal side may indicate there were issues with plating (see Notes) or that the device was not properly attached to the coverslip.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27218">### Notes</p><p class="ppzz"><strong>Plating neurons in microfluidic devices (Procedure E)</strong> </p><ol class="npwtwo"><li>The plating of the cells is a crucial step to maintaining the isolation between soma and axons. Be sure that the reservoirs and channel on the axonal compartment side of the device are filled with Feeding Media 1-2 min <strong>before</strong> adding cells to the reservoirs on the somal compartment side of the device. If the axonal compartment is empty when cells are added, the fluid dynamics will force the detached cells through the microchannels and into the axonal channel space. If this occurs, the device and its neurons cannot be used for further experimentation as the axons will no longer be an isolated population. (Steps E2-E3)</li><li>In Steps E4-E6, when adding the cells to the somal side of the device, it is advised to always check that cells are entering the somal compartment side channel via microscope. Fluid dynamics should pull the cells into the channel. If you do not observe this, return to the sterile culture hood and try gently removing the cells with a pipette. Make sure <strong>all</strong> media is removed from both top-right and bottom-right reservoirs, and again try placing the cells in the top-right reservoir where the reservoir joins the channel.<br/><br/></li></ol><strong>Reuse of microfluidic devices (Procedure H)</strong><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Only reuse devices that have <strong>not</strong> been exposed to any exogenous treatment not typically found in culture media, such as drugs, toxicants (<em>e.g.</em>, rotenone), or tissue fixative such as PFA. If the device has already been used during a treatment experiment or if the cells and device were already exposed to fixative, the device cannot be reused. <strong><em>Thus, any device in which an experiment was completed cannot be reused for another experiment.</em></strong> </li><li>This reuse method only applies to microfluidic devices that were pressed onto an extracellular-matrix coated coverslip. If the devices were bound to the coverslip using plasma bonding techniques (see the manufacturerâs instructions), they cannot be reused.</li><li>In our studies, we found that cultures from new devices and reused devices did not exhibit any discernable differences. Further, we observed no differences in the results obtained from experiments completed in new devices and experiments completed in reused devices.</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27219">###
