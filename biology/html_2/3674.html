            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> James M. Clegg, Thomas   Pratt</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Organotypic slice culture is a powerful technique for exploring the embryonic development of the mammalian brain. In this protocol we describe a basic slice culture technique we have used for two sets of experiments: axon guidance transplant assays and bead culture assays.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Organotypic slice culture is a technique that has been widely used in recent years and has been a particularly popular technique in the field of neurodevelopment. It has the great advantage of allowing the culture of developing neural cells <em>in-vitro</em> while maintaining the <em>in-vivo</em> structure of the tissue. In this protocol we describe the slice culture technique we used for two experiments from our recent paper (Clegg <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Firstly we performed an axon guidance transplant assay whereby fluorescently labeled tissue was transplanted into a non-fluorescent host slice in order to observe axon outgrowth. This is a modified version of a protocol previously used to study the development of the corpus callosum, but could be easily adapted to examine other axon tracts such as the thalamocortical tract (Niquille <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Secondly, we performed a bead culture assay in which beads soaked in recombinant FGF protein was embedded in the tissue, this allowed the examination of the molecular and cellular response of the tissue to the FGF protein. The use of protein soaked beads in this way provides a method for focal delivery of recombinant protein at a specific position, in contrast to bath application which exposes all tissue to the protein equally. This mimics the situation <em>in-vivo</em> where a morphogen (such as FGF17) is expressed at a particular anatomical position and then diffuses through the tissue. This technique could be used to explore the response to a number of different recombinant proteins or pharmacological agents.</p>

EBSS should then be placed on ice to cool.</li><li>Cull pregnant dams at the desired embryonic stage by dislocation of the neck or an overdose of anesthetic.<br/><em>Note: Slice cultures can be performed from embryonic day (E) 13.5 onwards. For axon guidance assays a stage should be selected during which axon outgrowth of the tract under investigation is occurring, e.g., E17.5 for the corpus callosum.</em> </li><li>Remove the uterus and place in a dish of pre-cooled oxygenated EBSS on ice, in the tissue culture hood, use scissors and forceps to remove embryos from the uterus. Using scissors, cut the head of the embryo from the body, and transfer to the second dish of EBSS.</li><li>Use forceps to peel away the skin from the head to reveal the skull, cut down the midline of the skull using microscissors and peel back the skull to reveal the brain. Carefully detach the brain from the base of the head using forceps.<br/><em>Note: Brains should be dissected out and placed in EBSS within 1 h of the pregnant dam being culled.</em> </li><li>Collect brains in 7 ml bijou tubes containing oxygenated EBSS and place tubes on ice.<br/><em>Note: Brains can be held at this stage for up to 3 h to allow time for genotyping (if necessary). It is recommended to add glucose to the EBSS (concentration 0.1%) if planning to hold brains at this stage.</em> </li><li>Embed brains individually in approximately 5 ml of low melting point agarose in square embedding molds. Agarose should be held at a temperature of 42 Â°C using a water bath prior to use. Place mold on ice once the tissue is positioned (Figure 1A).<br/><em>Note: Before positioning the brains at the desired plane, stir the agarose surrounding the tissue repeatedly in order to remove any carried over EBSS from the tissue. This prevents tissue separating from the agarose during sectioning (Figure 1A).</em> </li><li>Once set, remove agarose from mold and trim using a razor blade until the agarose block containing the tissue is &lt; 1 cm<sup>3</sup> (Figure 1B). Attach the agarose block to the specimen disk using adhesive (Figure 1C).<br/><em>Note. The plane of section should be determined by the brain region or axon tract under investigation, for corpus callosum axon guidance assays a coronal sectioning plane was used and tissue sections containing the telencephalon were collected.</em> </li><li>Section tissue on the vibratome at a section thickness of 400 Âµm in ice-cold 1x Krebs buffer.<br/><em>Note: While sectioning, the vibratome should be set to a frequency setting of 8 and a speed setting of 4. If tissue starts to break up reduce speed to 3.</em> </li><li>Collect tissue sections in 1x Krebs containing 100 mM HEPES, 0.5 mg/ml gentamicin and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.<br/><em>Note: Transfer of tissue sections should always be done with blunt-ended microspatulas, brushes should not be used as tissue can stick to bristles causing damage.</em> </li><li>Add 1 ml MEM with serum to the well of the organ culture dish. Place a Whatman nuclepore membrane onto the MEM at the center of the well (shiny side facing the liquid).</li><li>Carefully transfer a single tissue section to the center of the membrane making sure not to submerge any part of the membrane (Figures 1D and 1E). Incubate the culture for 1 h at 37 Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</li><li>Aspirate MEM and replace with 1 ml Neurobasal medium containing 2% B27 supplement, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 0.5% glucose and 2 mM glutamine.</li><li>Incubate at 37 Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 12-72 h and fix with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 Â°C.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Axon guidance transplant assays<ol class="npwtwo"><li>After aspirating MEM in Step A12, use a 45Â° blade or microscissors to dissect tissue from the donor section (Figure 1F).<br/><em>Note: Cutting the tissue explant into an asymmetrical shape will make it easier to maintain orientation during transplant.</em> </li><li>Cut a similarly sized piece of tissue from the host section and remove using a pipette.</li><li>Using a pipette transfer the donor tissue to the host section and maneuver into position using forceps (Figure 1G).<br/><em>Note: To ensure donor axon outgrowth into host tissue, the donor explant must be flush against the host tissue with no visible gap.</em> </li><li>Add neurobasal medium and culture for up to 72 h as above to allow for axon outgrowth.</li><li>Fix using 4% paraformaldehyde.</li><li>Cryoprotect by immersing sections in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight, or until the tissue has sunk, and embedded in 50% OCT embedding matrix; 50% Sucrose/PBS for cryosectioning. Frozen sections can then be processed for immunofluorescence.</li><li>If donor tissue expresses GFP or another fluorescent marker, immunofluorescence can then be performed to detect donor axon growth in host tissue.<br/><em>Note: While it may be possible to detect fluorescently labeled axons without any further staining, immunofluorescence will give a clearer signal for imaging.</em> </li><li>Stained sections can be imaged using epifluorescence or confocal microscopy.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Bead culture assays<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Affi-Gel blue gel beads (50 Âµl) are pre-soaked in recombinant protein or 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight at 4 Â°C.<br/><em>Note: The concentration of recombinant protein used to soak the beads should be determined for each protein used.
