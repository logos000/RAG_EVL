            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In mammalian organisms, fatty acids (FAs) exist mostly in esterified forms, as building blocks of phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesteryl esters, while some exist as non-esterified free FAs. The absolute quantification of FA species in total lipids or in a specific lipid class is critical in lipid-metabolism studies. To quantify FAs in biological samples, gas chromatographyâhydrogen flame ionization detection (GC-FID)-based methods have been used as highly robust and reliable techniques. Prior to GC-FID analysis, FAs need to be derivatized to volatile FA methyl esters (FAMEs). The derivatization of unsaturated FAs using classical derivatization methods that rely on high reaction temperature requires skill; consequently, the quantification results are often unreliable. The recently available FA-methylation procedure rapidly and reliably derivatizes a variety of FA species, including poly-unsaturated FAs (PUFAs). To analyze FAs in mammalian tissue samples, lipid extraction and fractionation are also critical for robust analysis. In this report, we describe a whole protocol for the GC-FID-based FA quantification of mammalian tissue samples, including lipid extraction, fractionation, derivatization, and quantification. The protocol is useful when various FAs, especially unsaturated FAs, need to be reliably quantified.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>A fatty acid (FA) is a carboxylic acid with an aliphatic chain, and FAs are classified according to their chain lengths (short, medium, long, very long) and the number of intramolecular double bonds (saturated, mono- or poly-unsaturated). In mammalian organisms, FAs exist mostly in esterified forms, such as phospholipids (PLs), triglycerides (TGs), and cholesteryl esters. PLs are major components of biological membranes, while TGs are important as concentrated energy stores, and cholesteryl esters play roles in cholesterol metabolism (Hishikawa <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Nielsen <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Hui and Howles, 2005; Van Meer <em>et al.</em>, 2008).<br/> <br/>Mammalian PLs are classified into several major classes, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic acid (PA), cardiolipin (CL), and sphingomyelin (SM), each of which contain a number of different molecular species due to the diversity of the two fatty acyl groups (<em>i.e.</em>, FAs) at their sn-1 and sn-2 positions (except for CL and SM, which contain four and one fatty acyls, respectively). PLs are known to have asymmetric FA profiles between the sn-1 and sn-2 positions; sn-1 prefers saturated or mono-unsaturated FAs, while sn-2 can be substituted by a variety of FAs, including poly-unsaturated FAs. The molecular basis and biological significance of the diversity in the FA compositions of membrane PLs had not been elucidated over many years, but recent studies have demonstrated critical roles for several lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs), which are enzymes that incorporate distinct FAs into phospholipids (Hashidate-Yoshida <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Shindou <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Iizuka-Hishikawa <em>et al.</em>, 2017). In these reports, phenotypic analysis of gene-targeted (knock-out) mice for the LPLAT gene(s) was performed along with the lipidomic profiling of various tissues. To this end, two methodologies, namely liquid-chromatographyâmass-spectrometry-based (LC-MS-based) PL molecular-species profiling (comparative/differential analysis) and gas chromatographyâhydrogen flame ionization detection (GC-FID) for the absolute quantification of FA compositions, have been adopted. These two methods are complementary; while the LC-MS method tracks relative PL changes at the molecular-species level, the GC-FID method provides absolute comparisons of various FAs in total lipids, PLs, and neutral lipids.<br/> <br/>GC-FID is one of the most robust techniques for detecting various fatty acids. Since GC can only analyze volatile compounds, FAs require prior derivatization, and are typically methylated to volatile FA methyl esters (FAMEs). Classical methylation protocols rely on high-temperature derivatization reactions (Vorbeck <em>et al.</em>, 1961; Liu, 1994), which require time and skill. An alternative derivatization procedure, which can be performed rapidly with mild heating has been established (Ichihara <em>et al.</em>, 1996; Ichihara and Fukubayashi, 2010), and is now commercially available in the form of a kit. As a GC detector, FID is favorably used for the robust detection of FAMEs. FID, which shows proportional responses to compound quantities with broad linear dynamic ranges, is suited to the sensitive detection of various organic compounds including FAMEs. MS-based detection (<em>e.g.</em>, GC-MS) is a more-sensitive alternative to FID, but FID is advantageous due to its stability, dynamic range, and its introduction and maintenance costs.<br/> <br/>In this report, we describe a whole protocol for quantifying the FAs of murine tissues by GC-FID. The protocol describes the determination of total FAs, which is the sum of the esterified FAs and non-esterified free FAs (FFAs) in the total lipids, and the esterified fatty acids in neutral or phospholipid fractions after solid-phase extraction (Egberts and Buiskool, 1988).</p>

As the RF values of all FAMEs are similar, the RF values of other FAMEs can be used as valid approximations.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="115" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427195221_7602.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.

As the raw quantification data are the FAME concentrations in the GC vials, the absolute amounts of the FAMEs in the sample can be obtained by proportional calculations, using the known amount (<em>i.e.</em>, 10 Âµg) of the C23:0 FA spiked into the samples:<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="115" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427195331_3070.jpg"/><br/><br/>The FAME amounts can then be converted into FA amounts using the molecular weights of the FAMEs and the corresponding FAs (see <a href="https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20200409/3613 Supplemental.docx" target="_blank">Supplemental</a>):<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="41" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427195417_1352.jpg"/><br/><br/><strong>Table 3. Example showing how FA amounts are calculated from raw quantification data.</strong> This table uses the quantification results for E18.5 mouse small intestine as an example. Raw quantification data from the GC Solution software, showing FAME concentrations in the GC vial (Âµg/ml), can be converted into FAME amounts (Âµg) by proportional calculations, which adjust the amount of C23:0 FAME in the sample to 10.396 Âµg (equivalent to 10 Âµg of C23:0 FA). FAME amounts can be further converted into FA amounts using molecular-weight ratios. Values shown in red are constants that are not affected by the various samples. When a part of a sample is subjected to FAME derivatization, further proportional calculations are necessary to determine the amounts of FA in the initial sample.<br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="659" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427195541_6508.jpg" width="600"/><br/></li><li>Perform proportional calculations to determine the amounts of FA in the initial sample. The amounts should be multiplied by 2.5 (= 1.0/0.4) for samples prepared using Procedure C (in which 0.4 ml from the total 1.0 ml was analyzed).<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti33098">### Notes</p><p class="ppzz">With the exception of pipette tips, do not use plasticware (tubes and containers) for organic solvents, as the quantification of several FAMEs will fail due to components leaching from the plasticware. For the same reason, do not transfer reagents from the Fatty Acid Methylation Kit into plastic containers before use. To volumetrically measure organic solvents accurately, pipettes should be pre-wetted with the solvent until no further drips are observed. This takes more than 10 aspiration/ejection cycles.<br/>  For safety, organic solvents should be used in a fume hood or a draught chamber. Wear lab coats and use protective glasses and gloves.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti33099">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Chloroform:2-propanol (2:1, v:v)<br/><em>Note: Prepare when required.</em><br/>Separately measure 40 ml of chloroform and 20 ml of 2-propanol with a glass graduated cylinder and mix in a clean glass bottle</li><li>2% acetic acid in diethyl ether<br/><em>Note: Prepare when required.</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li>Measure 60 ml of diethyl ether using a graduated cylinder</li><li>Transfer the diethyl ether to a clean glass bottle</li><li>Add 1.2 ml of acetic acid with a Pipetman (P1000 or P5000)</li></ol></li><li>2.8% ammonia in methanol<br/><em>Note: Prepare when required.</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li>Measure 54 ml of methanol using a graduated cylinder</li><li>Transfer the methanol to a clean glass bottle</li><li>Add 6 ml of 28% ammonia solution with a Pipetman (P1000 or P5000)</li></ol></li><li>PBS<br/>Dilute 5 ml of PBS (10x conc.) with ultra-pure water to a total volume of 50 ml</li><li>C23:0 FA (5 mg/ml stock and 1 mg/ml working solutions)<ol class="npwthree"><li>Prepare a chloroform:methanol (1:1, v:v) mixture in a similar manner to the chloroform:2-propanol (2:1) mixture, described above</li><li>Weigh 20 mg of C23:0 FA powder using a balance and dissolve in 4 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v:v) in a glass test tube (16 x 125 mm) using a pre-wetted pipette</li><li>To prepare the 1 mg/ml solution, dilute 1 ml of the 5-mg/ml stock solution with 4 ml of methanol in a glass tube (16 x 125 mm)</li><li>Both stock and working solutions can be stored at -30 Â°C in 2.0-ml autosampler vials sealed with screw caps</li></ol></li><li>Standard FAME mixtures (serial dilution)<br/><em>Note: Prepare when required and use a pre-wetted pipette for quantitative accuracy.</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li>Label four empty 0.5-ml microtubes as âstd1â, âstd2â, âstd3â, and âstd4â.</li><li>Place 30 Âµl of the Supelco 37-component FAME mix in the std1 tube.
