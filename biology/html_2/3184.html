            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Murine models of allergic airway disease are frequently used as a tool to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tissue-specific asthmatic disease pathogenesis. Paramount to the success of these models is the induction of experimental antigen sensitization, as indicated by the presence of antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin E. The quantification of antigen-specific serum IgE is routinely performed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, the reproducibility of these <em>in vitro</em> assays can vary dramatically in our experience. Furthermore, quantifying IgE via <em>in vitro</em> methodologies does not enable the functional relevance of circulating IgE levels to be considered. As a biologically appropriate alternative method, we describe herein a highly reproducible <em>in vivo</em> passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assay using Sprague Dawley rats for the quantification of ovalbumin-specific IgE in serum samples from ovalbumin-sensitized murine models. Briefly, this <em>in vivo</em> assay involves subcutaneous injections of serum samples on the back of a Sprague Dawley rat, followed 24 h later by intravenous injection of ovalbumin and a blue detection dye. The subsequent result of antigen-IgE mediated inflammation and leakage of blue dye into the initial injection site indicates the presence of ovalbumin-specific IgE within the corresponding serum sample.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Allergic asthma is a complex inflammatory disease, the development of which involves multiple intricate gene-environment interactions. A defining factor of the genetic component for disease inception is the predisposition to developing allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E to common allergens, otherwise known as atopy (Sly <em>et al.</em>, 2008). As such, allergic (atopic) sensitization to innocuous perennial aeroallergens during early childhood is now recognized as a fundamental risk factor in the establishment of potentially life-long allergic asthmatic disease (Illi <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Sly <em>et al.</em>, 2008), particularly when sensitization occurs to multiple aeroallergens (Stoltz <em>et al.</em>, 2013).<br/><br/>Murine models have long provided a means to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive onset and progression of allergic airway diseases such as allergic asthma (Kumar <em>et al.</em>, 2016). In this regard, mice are typically experimentally sensitized to a model antigen, resulting in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-helper (Th) type 2-driven inflammation and the production of antigen-specific IgE (Mincham <em>et al.</em>, 2018); the hallmark feature of allergic sensitization. Quantification of circulating serum antigen-specific IgE from antigen sensitized murine models is routinely performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, in our experience, these <em>in vitro</em> assays lack the necessary reproducibility for accurate detection of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific serum IgE in both Brown Norway rat and BALB/c mouse models of allergic airway disease. Furthermore, the use of <em>in vitro</em> techniques disregards the functional activity of antigen-specific IgE in a biologically relevant setting.<br/><br/>To combat the disadvantages of <em>in vitro</em> IgE quantification assays, we herein detail a highly reproducible <em>in vivo</em> passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) assay which enables both the quantification and assessment of biological activity of OVA-specific IgE within serum samples from OVA-sensitized murine models. In this regard, the localized cutaneous anaphylaxis response observed from an OVA-specific IgE positive sample is indicative of mast cell degranulation driven via OVA-induced cross-linking of OVA-specific IgE (Kawakami and Galli, 2002). The resultant release of mast cell granule-derived proinflammatory mediators exemplified by histamine, prostaglandin, leukotriene and tryptase, ultimately stimulates vascular permeability and the subsequent extravasation of the blue detection dye (Bradding and Arthur, 2016). While this protocol has been described for quantifying OVA-specific IgE in murine serum samples, it could be adapted to assess alternative model antigens.<br/></p>
