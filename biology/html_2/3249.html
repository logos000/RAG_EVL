            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Strawberry, including the woodland strawberry <em>Fragaria vesca</em> (2<em>x</em>) and the cultivated strawberry (<em>Fragaria</em> Ã <em>ananassa</em>, 8<em>x</em>), has emerged as a model system for studying fruit development and ripening. Transient expression provides a quick assay for gene functions or gene interactions. In strawberry, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and <em>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em>-mediated transformation in fruit have been widely used as the transient expression approaches. Unlike VIGS, the latter one can be utilized not only for gene knock-down, but also for overexpression and knock-out. Here, we show the procedures of transiently expressing the 35S::<em>FveMYB10</em> construct into fruit of the white-fruited <em>F. vesca</em> accession Yellow Wonder. As a master regulator of anthocyanin production, overexpressing <em>FveMYB10</em> will cause fruit coloration, which was observed at one week post infiltration. We also exhibit the previous results of knocking down <em>Reduced Anthocyanin in Petioles</em> (<em>RAP</em>), encoding an anthocyanin transporter, by RNAi in fruit of the strawberry cultivar âSweet Charlieâ. Overall, <em>Agrobacterium</em>-mediated transient transformation in strawberry fruit is a quick and versatile approach for studying gene functions in fruit ripening.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Cultivated strawberry (<em>Fragaria</em> Ã <em>ananassa</em>, 8<em>x</em>) is an economically important fruit crop grown worldwide with lovely appearance and rich nutrition. The wild diploid strawberry <em>Fragaria vesca</em> has emerged as a model plant for cultivated strawberry as well as other fleshy fruit species. Moreover, strawberry is a typical non-climacteric fruit, studies on the ripening of which lack a nice model system, like tomato as a model of the climacteric fruit. Therefore, strawberry is also frequently used for studying fruit ripening. <br/><br/>Stable transformation is doable in both woodland and cultivated strawberry; however, the entire process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In contrast, the transient expression assay in fruit is much faster and more efficient. There are two transient gene expression approaches in strawberry, namely Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) and <em>Agrobacterium</em>-mediated transformation (Spolaore <em>et al.</em>, 2001). Some studies obtained nice results by using VIGS (Jia <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2019). However, we utilize the <em>Agrobacterium</em>-mediated transformation more frequently as it can achieve more experimental aims, including gene knock-down (Hoffmann <em>et al.</em>, 2006), overexpression (Huang <em>et al.</em>, 2018), and knock-out (Tang <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>The <em>F. vesca</em> fruit takes 25-30 days from being pollinated to ripen under our growth conditions. The entire process is divided into seven stages: flower/anthesis, small green, medium green, large green, white, turning, and red. Fruit receptacle (the juicy flesh) at the large green stage, when the firmness starts to decline rapidly (before the achenes turn red for the red strawberry fruit), is suitable for agrobacterium injection. Fruit receptacles at prior stages are recalcitrant to the injection owing to the texture. Thus, <em>Agrobacterium</em>-mediated transformation in strawberry fruit delimits functional studies on genes acting at late developmental stages.<br/><br/>The bright red color of strawberry fruit is caused by the accumulation of anthocyanin compounds, which is a visible phenotype to check. In strawberry, the R2R3-MYB transcription factor <em>FveMYB10</em> is a master regulator of anthocyanin synthesis (Lin-Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2014). The woodland strawberry includes both red-fruited and white-fruited varieties, owing to a natural SNP occurred in <em>FveMYB10</em>; overexpression of <em>FveMYB10</em> results in accumulation of red pigments in fruit of the white-fruited accession Yellow wonder (YW) (Hawkins <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Recently, we identified one anthocyanin transporter encoding gene <em>Reduced Anthocyanin in Petioles</em> (<em>RAP</em>) through chemical mutagenesis, knock-down of which greatly reduced fruit pigmentation (Luo <em>et al.</em>, 2018). <br/><br/>In this study, as an example, we describe the procedures of transiently overexpressing <em>FveMYB10</em> in fruit of YW. Moreover, we exhibit the results of knocking down <em>RAP</em> in fruit of the strawberry cultivar âSweet Charlieâ.</p>

Suck up the solution into the syringe, insert the needle tip into the center of the fruit from the apex, and gently press the syringe to release the solution. For a big fruit, such as that of the cultivated strawberry, more injections in other parts of the fruit are sometimes required to make the entire fruit soaked with the solution (Video 1).<br/><em>Note: Inject at least 10 fruits for each construct. Use fruits infiltrated only with the injection buffer as the negative control.</em><br/><br/><!--video3249-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3249-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3249-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3249/3249-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.

We can see that the injected fruits are full of water under the receptacle skin (Figure 1B). One week later, fruit coloration has been fully developed (Figure 1C). Frequently, some area of the receptacle turns red, while the rest remains white. When the fruit is cut into two halves, tissues close to the skin turn red, while the inner part remains white. The intensity of the GFP fluorescence correlates well with the fruit coloration (data not shown). In contrast, fruits injected with only the injection buffer (negative control) stay white (Figure 1D). Anthocyanin synthesis or ripening genes are often transiently modified in cultivated strawberry. In order to illustrate that this approach is also suitable for gene knock-down, we exhibit the cultivated strawberry fruit transiently transformed with the <em>RAP</em>-RNAi construct (binary vector pK7WIWG2D) (Figure 1E) (Luo <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Of note, the parts with GFP fluorescence overlap with the parts possessing color change, although <em>GFP</em> and <em>RAP</em> are independently driven by the 35S constitutive promoter in one construct.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190528/20190528225142_1174.jpg" width="212"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

We suggest using vectors carrying a visible reporter to facilitate phenotype observation and tissue collection. GFP or other fluorescent proteins are better options than the Î²-glucuronidase (GUS).</li><li>Grow the plants at about 25 Â°C. Lower or higher temperatures (30 Â°C) will greatly reduce the efficiency or even lead to a complete failure.</li><li>We succeeded in transforming a mixture of agrobacteria harboring two constructs, respectively, in a ratio of 1:1. This provides more potentials of examining the interactions between two or more genes. </li><li>Besides <em>F. vesca</em> and <em>F. Ã ananassa</em>, this approach should be applicable to other <em>Fragaria</em> species as well.</li><li>In this transient strawberry transformation, no acetosyringone is used. In the strawberry stable transformation, acetosyringone is added into the incubation buffer, and a few hoursâ incubation of the cell suspension is required. This optimization might be tested in the future.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27854">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Luria Broth (LB) medium<br/>10 g L<sup>-1</sup> Tryptone<br/>5 g L<sup>-1</sup> Yeast extract<br/>10 g L<sup>-1</sup> NaCl<br/>pH 7.0<br/>15 g L<sup>-1</sup> Agar (for the solid LB medium)</li><li>Injection buffer<br/>0.44 g MS powder <br/>2 g Sucrose <br/>100 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O <br/>pH 5.8</li><li>Antibiotics<br/>50 mg L<sup>-1</sup> Gent <br/>50 mg L<sup>-1</sup> Rif <br/>50 mg L<sup>-1</sup> Spe<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27855">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This work in Kangâs lab was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31572098, 31772274, and 31822044).
