            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Bone strength is controlled by both bone mass, and the organization and quality of the bone material. The current standard method for measuring bone mass in mouse and rat studies is micro-computed tomography. This method typically uses a single threshold to identify bone material in the cortical and trabecular regions. However, this single threshold method obscures information about the mineral content of the bone material and depends on normal morphology to separately analyze cortical and trabecular structures. To extend this method to identify bone mass at multiple density levels, we have established a protocol for unbiased selection and application of multiple thresholds using a standard laboratory-based micro-computed tomography instrument. This non-invasive method can be applied to longitudinal studies and archived samples and provides additional information about bone structure and strength.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>Micro-computed tomography is a well-established standardized method for measuring bone mass and structure in experimental mice and rats. Typically, the inner network of bone (trabecular) is analyzed separately from the thick outer shell of bone (cortical). Identifying trabecular and cortical regions is usually either manual or uses algorithm-based segmentation on the basis of morphology (Buie <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Bouxsein <em>et al.</em>, 2010). A single threshold within each region is used to define bone: cortical bone is detected using a high threshold, and trabecular bone at a lower threshold (Ansari <em>et al.</em>, 2018; McGregor <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Recently however, while analyzing a genetically altered mouse model with severely disrupted bone structure (<em>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></em>), it was not possible to delineate cortical and trabecular structures (Cho <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Walker <em>et al.</em>, 2020), and standard segregation of bone into trabecular and cortical was not meaningful. Such segregation would also be challenging in other mouse models where cortical bone structure is abnormal, such as during ageing or in chronic kidney disease when it is porous (Piemontese <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Metzger <em>et al.</em>, 2020), or in conditions with poorly formed cortex such as osteopetrosis (Abe <em>et al.</em>, 2000). Using a single threshold also reduces the amount of information that can be gained from micro-computed tomography, in which raw images show multiple levels of gray that are reduced to a single level for quantitation.<br/></p><p><br/>To overcome this problem and move away from the dichotomy of “trabecular” and “cortical” bone, we made use of multi-level Otsu thresholding to measure bone mass at multiple density levels. The Otsu method makes use of an algorithm that segments pixels from the raw images into different classes based on the gray level intensities within the image (Otsu, 1979). Initially, we applied this method to the metaphyseal region (Walker <em>et al.</em>, 2020) because it contains both immature and mature cortical bone, with the most mature bone at greatest distance from the growth plate (Rauch, 2012). Using this new method applied to a slice-by-slice analysis of the metaphyseal region enabled quantification of the process by which normal cortical bone matures over time, specifically, the replacement of a low density structure with a more robust higher-density structure (Walker <em>et al.</em>, 2020). It also revealed a higher proportion of low density cortical bone in the mature skeleton of <em>Dmp1<sup>Cre</sup>:Socs3<sup>f/f</sup></em> mice (Walker <em>et al.</em>, 2020), which we previously reported to have impaired strength, even though the structure was normal when measured by a single-threshold method (Cho <em>et al.</em>, 2017). We have also used this method to identify deposition of new bone resulting in a change in bone shape due to pharmacologically-induced muscle hypertrophy (Chan <em>et al.</em>, Submitted).<br/></p><p><br/>This unbiased method of measuring bone at multiple densities is non-destructive and can be used to measure changes in bone over time, since it can be used in micro-computed tomography scans of live animals (Walker <em>et al.</em>, 2020). The method may also be applied to the study of bone development (Bortel <em>et al.</em>, 2015), and to the analysis of human bone, particularly during ageing (Zebaze <em>et al.</em>, 2010). The method may also be helpful for providing new methods for age estimation in bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology (Maggiano <em>et al.</em>, 2015), and would provide valuable new information in study of other species, such as measuring bone mass at different density levels that have been observed with egg-laying (Squire <em>et al.</em>, 2017) and hibernation (McGee-Lawrence <em>et al.</em>, 2009).</p><p>We describe here the use of this method as it is applied to the metaphyseal region of fixed murine femora which contains both immature and mature bone, since this is likely to be the most common application. The same approach can be used for smaller or different regions, and for scans of bones taken from mice, or other species, including longitudinal studies under anaesthetic. This method can also be applied to archived scans, in which case the protocol need only be followed from Procedure C onwards. This protocol assumes a basic familiarity with micro-computed tomography.</p><br/></p>

We define the proximal end of the bone as the slice where the femoral head and the trochanter first meet (Figure 2C). In the distal femur, we identify the growth plate by identifying the site where the four quadrants of the femoral growth plate begin to merge. As you scroll from the distal end towards the center of the bone, you will notice the presence of four circular quadrants of the growth plate, that enlarge and meet (Figure 2D). The medial and lateral growth plate regions meet first. We call this the first meeting. As you continue to scroll, the anterior and posterior growth plate regions meet. We call this convergence of the growth plate âthe second meetingâ and define it as the âgrowth plateâ slice. Use the measurement values for each landmark to calculate bone length by subtracting the distal measurement from the proximal measurement (Figure 2E).</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3873/bioprotoc-11-01-3873-g002.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

We do this so that the same anatomical region is measured in each sample, regardless of whether bone growth is modified. In the original publication using this method, we defined the distal end of the region of interest as the slice at a distance equal to 7.5% of the femur length from the growth plate (see Figure 2A (Walker <em>et al.</em>, 2020) for a representation of this region of interest); this normally encompasses the secondary spongiosa. We define the proximal end of the metaphyseal region as the slice located an additional 15% of the femur length from the newly defined top measurement. Calculate these values in Microsoft Excel using the landmarks identified in Step 6, above (Figure 2E).</p></li><li><p>Select the ROI icon to enable a âRegion of Interestâ drop down menu. From here, select an âellipticalâ region that encompasses both trabecular and cortical bone within the top slice. Repeat this for the bottom slice of the ROI. The CTan software will interpolate the ROI for the slices in-between. Manually check the ROI generated on each slice by scrolling through the dataset to ensure that the entirety of the bone is contained within the whole ROI. Save this as a new metaphyseal dataset.</p><br/></li></ol></li><li><p>Define four bone density thresholds using the Otsu algorithm in control samples</p><p><em>Note: This should be performed separately for each study, unless you aim to compare volumes of bone at defined densities between studies.

This can be found within the sample folder. This file contains a summary of the 2D measurements, followed by individual measurements for each image slice at each threshold.

To do this, you first need to associate each 2D slice with its longitudinal position. For example, using Sample 1 from Figure 2E, the first slice corresponds to 7.5% of bone length, which is 1.95 mm from the growth plate, and the last slice ends at 3.14 mm from the growth plate. Type these values in the cell adjacent to the corresponding B.Ar/T.Ar value. Highlight this column, beginning and ending at the first and last values, and use the âFillâ function in Excel to populate the empty cells with incremental values.
