            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The deposition of misfolded, aggregated tau protein is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, collectively termed âtauopathiesâ. Tau pathology spreads throughout the brain along connected pathways in a prion-like manner. The process of tau pathology propagation across circuits is a focus of intense research and has been investigated <em>in vivo</em> in human post-mortem brain and in mouse models of the diseases, <em>in vitro</em> in diverse cellular systems including primary neurons, and in cell free assays using purified recombinant tau protein. Here we describe a protocol that takes advantage of a minimalistic neuronal circuit arrayed within a microfluidic device to follow the propagation of tau misfolding from a presynaptic to a postsynaptic neuron. This assay allows high-resolution imaging as well as individual manipulation of the releasing and receiving neuron, and is therefore beneficial for investigating the propagation of tau and other misfolded proteins <em>in vitro</em>.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The propagation of misfolded protein throughout the brain underlies the spread of pathology in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimerâs disease, Parkinsonâs and Prion disease (Goedert <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Davis <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Hallinan <em>et al.</em>, 2019a). Understanding the underlying mechanisms may help limit disease progression and is therefore an area of intense research. Several <em>in vivo</em> and <em>in vitro</em> assays exist that monitor this process, including mouse models that develop neurodegeneration in response to overexpressing mutant human tau (Allen <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Ramsden <em>et al.</em>, 2005; SantaCruz <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Gibbons <em>et al.</em>, 2017). <em>In vitro</em> models include cell lines expressing biosensors that monitor aggregation (Kfoury <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Holmes <em>et al.</em>, 2014) and primary neuronal cultures, including those in microfluidic devices (Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2013 and 2016, Takeda <em>et al.</em>, 2015). In this protocol we describe in detail an <em>in vitro</em> assay to monitor the seeding and propagation of tau misfolding across connected neurons. This protocol builds on previously established assays, as described above, but additionally allows to monitor not just the passage of misfolded tau from one neuron to the next, but also the seeding in the previously unaffected cell, thus fully recapitulating inter-neuronal propagation. The microfluidic setup further allows individual manipulation of the pre- and postsynaptic cell, and high resolution live and fixed cell imaging of both connected neurons. This assay can be adapted for the study of the spread of other proteinopathies, such as prion or Î±-synuclein pathology. In addition, the basic directionalised and connected setup allows the culture of a range of different neuronal subtypes and thus the study of various other trafficking- and spread-related neurotoxic agents, including that of viruses and environmental insults such as nanoparticle toxicity.</p>

This script is designed to detect increased variability in fluorescence distribution, which is observed upon formation of fluorescent accumulations/ aggregates. You need paired control and experimental axons from one repeat, the values pasted as columns into two separate spreadsheets. Important: adjust the number in line 25 to the number determined following script âbaseline_analysisâ. The script imports your control (e.g., wildtype tau) values as âcontrolâ and your experimental (e.g., mutant tau) values as âexperimentalâ. As above, all values are zeroed to the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile to eliminate variability due to different expression levels (lines 29, 32 and 64, 67). The first part of the script determines the variability within this control dataset. To allow for control axons to score positive, only those axons falling within the allowed baseline variability determined in the script âbaseline_analysisâ are included (line 25). A logical array (line 51) then tests for each individual fluorescent value whether it is larger than the mean plus 5 standard deviations of those axons that were included into the control group in line 41. Those that score positive in each column are assigned a â1â and are added up and divided by the total number of individual values per column. This gives a fraction of axonal values scoring positive. If this fraction is &gt; 0.1 (10% of the values) the axon is counted as positive. Line 60 determines the percentage of control axons meeting this criteria.</em><br/><em>The second part of the script tests the experimental dataset. Following deduction of the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile (lines 64, 67), the script tests all individual values against the maximum allowed baseline value determined from the controls (line 71), adds up the positive scores from each axon (line 74), normalizes these to the size of the dataset (lines 77, 78) to determine the percentage of axons scoring positive in this experiment (line 80).</em><br/><br/></li><li>Adjust in line 25 to the value determined as allowed baseline variation above.<br/></li><li>Import control and experimental data set from one experiment as âcontrolâ and âexperimentalâ.<br/></li><li>The script will first determine the observed variation of all axons that are within the allowed variability across experiments in this particular experiment (Figure 10B, grey shaded area), and then use this value to determine the percentage of control axons that have more than 10% of their values outside the allowed variability and thus score positive (such as the black trace in Figure 10B).<br/></li><li>It will then determine the percentage of experimental axons that have more than 10% of their values outside the allowed variability and thus score positive (see Figure 11).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="131" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816091152_6338.png" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 11. Visual representation of the aggregate analysis.</strong> First, intensity values outside the allowed variability are determined (A, values outside the grey box). Then the script calculates what percentage of axonal stretch falls within this category. Results for individual axons are plotted in B. The axons are scored as positive if more than 10% of their values are in this category. This allows to rule out false-positives such as due to untransfected axons crossing. Finally, the percentage of axons that score positive within one experiment is calculated.<br/><br/></li><li>You now have the results for one repeat.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti35223">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Transfection efficiency is generally low, expect ~2-3 transfected neurons that also project through the microgrooves to the adjacent channel per device.</li><li>Each axon that projects through to the next channel typically branches out widely, thus almost every projecting neuron will make contact with a transfected neuron in the next channel.</li><li>The low transfection efficiency allows for full reconstruction of the two connecting neurons.
