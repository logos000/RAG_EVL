            <h1>Photodynamic Therapy in a 3D Model of Ovarian Cancer</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Shubhankar Nath, Kaitlin Moore</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT), is a clinically-approved light-based anti-cancer treatment modality in which a photoactivatable photosensitizer is irradiated with an appropriate wavelength of light to generate cytotoxic molecules to kill cancer cells. In this article, we describe an <em>in vitro</em> PDT protocol using a 3-dimensional (3D) model of ovarian cancer that was established on beds of Matrigel. PDT was performed using a liposomal formulation of verteporfin photosensitizer (Visudyne<sup>Â®</sup>). The cancer cells were genetically-labeled with the fluorescent protein mCherry to facilitate the evaluation of the treatment response. This protocol is advantageous because the mCherry fluorescence is an indicator of cell viability, eliminating the need for external dyes, which often exhibit limited penetration and diffusion into 3D organoids. Additionally, Visudyne PDT achieves significant tumor-killing efficacy in a 3D model for ovarian cancer.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an FDA-approved light-based treatment modality that utilizes a photoactivatable molecule, termed a photosensitizer (PS). Upon irradiation with an appropriate wavelength of light, the PS generates reactive molecular species (RMS) within the cytosol. These RMS, often reactive oxygen species, induce photodamage and are toxic to the cell (Celli <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Obaid <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Certain formulations of PS preferentially accumulate in the malignant tissue and thus PDT often achieves dual selectivity as a result of confined PS accumulation in the tumor and its spatiotemporal control over the light irradiation. PDT is clinically approved for several indications, including esophageal cancer, lung cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and is being investigated for many more cancerous and noncancerous indications (Celli <em>et al.</em>, 2010).<br/><br/>Ovarian cancer is a deadly gynecologic malignancy often associated with treatment-resistant metastases and poor outcomes in patients. While surgery and chemotherapy are the current standard of care for ovarian cancer, the efficacy of PDT to manage ovarian cancer is currently being investigated in pre-clinical studies by many research groups (Goff <em>et al.</em>, 1996; Rizvi <em>et al.</em>, 2010). <br/><br/>Like many other malignancies, ovarian cancer metastases display complex morphological and biochemical characteristics that are lost in traditional monolayer (2D) cell culture. 3D tumor model is an emerging technique for evaluating tumor properties and treatment response <em>in vitro</em>. 3D cultures of tumor cells create a more physiologically relevant tumor microenvironment than traditional 2D cell culture because they retain the biological and structural features of tumors that are found <em>in vivo</em> (Rizvi <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Cells in monolayer experience contact inhibition and a homogeneous oxygen and nutrient environment, while 3D cultures display heterogeneity within and across spheroids and restore extracellular matrix-related cues that are important in treatment response. Like <em>in vivo</em> tumors, 3D cultured tumors proliferate into heterogeneous clusters with varying levels of oxygen and nutrients, making them useful tools for studying PS uptake and PDT efficacy within oxygen gradients. Increased PDT resistance has been found in 3D tumor models compared with 2D, providing a platform for testing alternative treatment regimens and combination therapies to overcome this resistance. The complex factors that contribute to treatment failure in patients necessitate an <em>in vitro</em> model that mimics the structural, biological, and extracellular cues that play a major role in treatment outcomes (Rizvi <em>et al.</em>, 2016). <br/><br/>Here, we describe an <em>in vitro</em> PDT protocol using a 3D model of ovarian cancer. 3D nodules of human ovarian cancer cells (NIH: Ovcar5) that stably express a fluorescent reporter were grown on beds of Growth Factor-Reduced Matrigel<sup>Â®</sup>. PDT was performed using FDA-approved PS verteporfin (Visudyne<sup>Â®</sup>). The treatment response was evaluated by imaging of the fluorescent 3D nodules. The protocol described here has been adapted from a previously published article (Rizvi <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</p>
