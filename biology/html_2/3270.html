            <h1>Neurostore: A Novel Cryopreserving Medium for Primary Neurons</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Francesca Pischedda, Giovanni   Piccoli</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Primary neuronal culture from rodents is a key tool in neurobiology. However, the preparation of primary cultures requires precise planning, starting from animal mating. Furthermore, each preparation generates a high amount of cells that eventually go wasted. The possibility to cryopreserve primary neural cells represents a resource for <em>in vitro</em> studies and significantly reduces the sacrifice of animals. Here we describe that Neurostore buffer supports the cryopreservation of primary neurons.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Primary rodent cultures are a primary tool in any neurobiology laboratory. Primary cultures last 2-3 weeks. Therefore cells are normally prepared when necessary and employed in experiments immediately upon isolation. Cryopreservation is a routine procedure to allow long-term storage of mammalian cells. A protocol to achieve cryopreservation of neuronal cells would spare animals sacrifice and avoid the waste of cells. Furthermore, cell storage might permit the creation of cultures archive, support the reproducibility of experiments, and improve specimen sharing among different laboratories. Several studies have proposed a protocol to achieve the cryopreservation of neurons (Ichikawa <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Paynter, 2008; Ma <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Here we describe Neurostore, a novel buffer that promotes the long-term storage of primary mouse neurons and assures high viability upon thawing. </p>

We thawed and seeded cultures after one week at -80 Â°C. After 14-days in culture, we noticed that cultures frozen in Neurostore generated a complex network of processes (Figure 1A).</li><li>Using MTT assay, we noticed comparable viability among fresh and cultures stored in Neurostore at -80 Â°C for 2 or 4 weeks (Figure 1B). Physiologically, neuronal cultures respond to pharmacological stimulation by triggering intracellular pathways. Cryopreserved cultures and acutely dissociated ones answered comparably in terms of AKT (Protein Kinase B) or ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) phosphorylation upon FGFb (Basic fibroblast growth factor) or EGF (Epidermal growth factor) stimulation (Figures 1F-1H). Cryopreservation procedure may induce oxidative stress. However, ROS (Reactive oxygen species) production resulted similar between fresh and cryopreserved cultures (Figures 2C and 2F).</li><li>Next, we infected cell with GFP expressing virus and analyzed the morphology of the culture at DIV14 (Figure 3A). The analysis of neurite number, total length, and average length did not reveal any significant difference among acutely dissociated and cryopreserved cultures (Figures 3B-3D).</li><li>To appreciate synaptic architecture, we stained acutely dissociated and 2- and 4-week cryopreserved cultures for synapsin and PSD-95 at DIV14 (Figure 4A). We could not detect any major differences among the experimental groups under analysis (Figures 4B-4D). To complement this analysis, we investigated by Western-blotting the expression of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in acutely dissociated and 2- and 4-week cryopreserved cortical cultures at DIV14 (Figures 5A-5C).</li><li>Lastly, we analyzed the electrical features of acutely dissociated and 2- and 4-week cryopreserved cortical cultures by whole-cell patch clamp recording. The quantification of all parameters demonstrated no significant differences between frozen cultures and fresh neurons (Figure 6 and Table 2).</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28096">### Notes</p><p class="ppzz">Neuronal mortality in Neurostore medium is estimated in 20%-30% for both cortical and hippocampal neurons if cells are stored at the concentration of 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml Neurostore medium.
