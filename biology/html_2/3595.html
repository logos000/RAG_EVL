            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>A key component of combating substance use disorders is understanding the neural mechanisms that support drug reward. Tasks such as self-administration assess the reinforcing properties of a drug using a learned behavior but require numerous training sessions and surgery. In comparison, the conditioned place preference (CPP) task assesses reward with little training, without costly surgeries, and confounds that accompany the use of anesthesia or pain-relieving drugs. The CPP task contains three phases: pretest, conditioning, and posttest. During the pretest, mice are allowed to explore a three-compartment apparatus. The two outer compartments contain unique olfactory, tactile, and visual cues whereas the middle compartment is used as an entrance and exit for the mice on test days. During conditioning, mice receive cocaine before being confined to one of the outer compartments. The following day, mice are given saline then confined to the other outer compartment. These pairings are then repeated once. At posttest, mice are permitted to freely explore all compartments in a drug-free state while the time spent in each compartment is recorded. A CPP score is calculated for both the pretest and posttest by comparing the time spent in the cocaine-paired and saline-paired compartments. Enhancements in the CPP score from the pretest to the posttest serve as a measure of the rewarding property of the cocaine. This task offers several notable advantages: 1) the simultaneous recording of locomotor activity and reward, which may utilize different neural mechanisms, 2) the three-compartment CPP setup removes the bias that can be observed in a two-compartment design, and 3) use of multimodal cues support the acquisition of a robust preference in a variety of mouse strains.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm has been used for decades to examine the role of genes, histone modifications, signaling pathways, and brain regions in drug-associated memory and reward (see Tzschentke, 1998; Malvaez <em>et al.</em>, 2009). It incorporates classical conditioning to assess the rewarding effects of contextual cues that have been associated with a drug (for reviews see Schechter and Calcagnetti, 1993; Everitt <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Bardo and Bevin, 2000). There are various CPP chamber designs and configurations, depending on the specific research question being addressed (Bardo and Bevin, 2000). However, the most commonly used designs are the two-compartment or three-compartment chambers. Both chambers types rely on the ability of mice to differentiate between two compartments that contain distinct olfactory, tactile, and visual cues. The three-compartment design contains an additional compartment, between the two larger compartments, that does not contain olfactory or tactile cues, and is used only for the entry and removal of mice at test. Here, we describe the equipment setup, key parameters, and data collection in the three-compartment CPP paradigm using adult mice. The focus of this protocol is on cocaine CPP. However, this paradigm can be used for other drugs of abuse (<em>e.g.</em>, other psychostimulants, opioids, and nicotine).<br/><br/>The three-compartment design allows mice to choose whether to enter either the cocaine or saline-paired compartments or remain in the center compartment. Conversely, the two-compartment chambers require mice to be placed in either the saline-paired or the cocaine-paired compartments to begin the test. This has the potential to introduce bias for the compartment in which the mice is place at post-test. Using tactile, olfactory and visual cues allows mice to form a memory for each context that does not rely on one sensory system. Therefore, the likelihood that mice with sensory deficits (<em>e.g.</em>, poor vision) will fail to acquire a drug-associated preference is reduced. Other variations of the task (<em>e.g.</em>, olfactory only) can require four cocaine pairings, which results in eight total injections when the saline injections are included. Acquisition in our task requires two cocaine pairings (four total injections) for robust cocaine CPP, which reduces the likelihood that stress and irritation at the site of injection will be significant factors in the experiment. Furthermore, if both the control and experimental groups equally acquire a preference, the posttest day of the CPP task can serve as the first day of an extinction experiment. This subsequent extinction experiment would allow the experimenter to examine the persistence of the acquired cocaine-associated memory. Overall, the CPP paradigm provides an adaptable, quick, and inexpensive method of assessing drug reward in adult mice.<br/></p>

The experiment is counterbalanced to ensure that half of the mice have cocaine paired with the white compartment while the other half have the cocaine paired with the checkered compartment. On days 6 and 8, saline is administered before the mice are confined to the large compartment that has not been associated with cocaine. They are then permitted to explore that compartment for 30 minutes. Mice are given a day off on day 9 and remain in their home cages.

Alternatively, if the results are not normally distributed, non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Whitney test can be used.

The results from the statistical tests will also indicate whether there are any significant changes in the amount of time in the cocaine paired chamber between groups. These specific comparisons can be made using Studentâs <em>t</em>-tests with Î±-levels held at 0.05.
