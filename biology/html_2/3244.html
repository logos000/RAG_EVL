            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Mammalian cell transfection is a powerful technique commonly used in molecular biology to express exogenous DNA or RNA in cells and study gene and protein function. Although several transfection strategies have been developed, there is a wide variation with regards to transfection efficiency, cell toxicity and reproducibility. Thus, a sensitive and robust method that can optimize transfection efficiency based not only on expression of the target protein of interest but also on the uptake of the nucleic acids, can be an important tool in molecular biology. Herein, we present a simple, rapid and robust flow cytometric method that can be used as a tool to optimize transfection efficiency while overcoming limitations of prior established methods that quantify transfection efficiency.</p>
            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Transfection, Flow cytometry, Nucleic acids, Protein expression, DNA labeling</p>
            <h2>Background</h2><p>Transfection is one of the most commonly used techniques in molecular biology (Stoll and Calos, 2002; Kim and Eberwine, 2010). Transfection is the process of introducing nucleic acid (DNA that carries a gene of interest or mRNA) into target cells that then eventually express the desired nucleic acid or protein. There are several biological, chemical, and physical methods for introducing nucleic acids into cells (Stoll and Calos, 2002; Kim and Eberwine, 2010; Zhou <em>et al.</em>, 2016). However, all these methods are variable and donât assess the cell transfection efficiency, cell toxicity and the level of gene expression within the same experiment. To truly optimize cellular transfection, a sensitive and robust detection assay is required to quantify and optimize the efficiency of different transfection methods to deliver the target gene into the cytosol and facilitate protein expression, while reducing cell toxicity.<br/><br/>Herein, we demonstrate the development of a flow-cytometric assay to determine transfection efficiency by labeling a reporter plasmid with Label IT<sup>Â®</sup> Tracker<sup>TM</sup> (Homann <em>et al.</em>, 2017) (Figure 1). This method does not depend on co-transfection of two different plasmids and simultaneously quantifies cell death, uptake of the labeled plasmid during transient transfection, and expression of the target protein. We demonstrate that this method can be used as a tool to i) optimize transfection efficiency in 2 independent standard cell lines, ii) quantify cellular toxicity of different transfection methods, iii) determine uptake of DNA into difficult to transfect cells via electroporation without the need to use co-transfection of GFP plasmid that can further reduce the efficiency of transfection. This flow cytometric method can be directly applied to optimize several transfection methods including gene therapy strategies (<em>e.g.</em>, CRISPR/Cas system).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190516/20190516025049_0069.jpg" width="233"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Experimental design for determination of transfection efficiency by flow cytometric method.</strong> The plasmid DNA was labeled with FITC by DNA label IT@ tracker. After transfection, cells were detected by flow cytometry. The FITC fluorochrome is used to detect intracellular levels of the transfected plasmid that has been labeled with FITC (Label IT tracker, green). The second fluorochrome is used to quantify expression of the target protein (by directly measuring fluorescence of the expressed protein if the target protein is fluorescent or by using a fluorescent-labeled antibody against the target protein, red). Either Q1+Q2 (DNA signal) or Q2+Q3 (protein signal) should be used as readouts of transfection efficiency.<br/></p>

Flow cytometric determination of transfection efficiency based on two independent readouts (DNA plasmid uptake and protein expression).</strong> Representative transfections are shown. 293T cells underwent chemical transfection using the TransITX2 transfection reagent as described in Procedure. The same amount (1 Î¼g) of DNA was used for two independent plasmids: a small (B. pUltraHot expressing mCherry, 8.3 kb) and a large (C. pNL4-3 expressing p24, 14.0 kb) DNA plasmid. Gating strategy is shown: A) forward and side scatters B) discrimination of doublets C, D) two independent readouts of transfection efficiency. FITC fluorescence corresponds to the uptake of FITC-labeled plasmid DNA (y-axis). A fluorochrome that has no spectral overlap with FITC is used to quantify protein expression. Either a fluorescent protein can be used (<em>e.g.</em>, mCherry; shown in C) or a protein labeled with a fluorescent-labeled antibody (<em>e.g.</em>, intracellular expression of HIV-1 p24 protein was detected by a CF647-labeled anti-p24 antibody; shown in D). Co-expression of DNA taken up by cells and target protein were analyzed 24 h after transfection. The numbers in the quadrants indicate the percentages of viable cells that took up the FITC labeled DNA plasmid versus the expressed protein that was detected. The following dot plots are shown for each chemical transfection in 293T cells: i) untransfected cells (negative control), ii) cells transfected with FITC-labeled DNA plasmid harvested before protein expression occurred (3 h post transfection), iii) cells transfected with unlabeled plasmid harvested 24 h after transfection (when protein expression can be quantified) iv) cells transfected with FITC-labeled DNA plasmid and harvested 24 h after transfection (when protein expression can be quantified). In this plot Q3 quadrant demonstrates many cells that express protein but do not show any fluorescence associated with uptake of the plasmid DNA. Either Q1+Q2 (DNA signal) or Q2+Q3 (protein signal) should be used as readouts of transfection efficiency. E. Transfection efficiency was quantified in human lymphocytes (Jurkat E6 cells) harvested 24 h after electroporation with FITC-labeled DNA mCherry plasmid without the need to use co-transfection of 2 different plasmids and GFP reporter.</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34062">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz">Results of the peak fluorescence measurements are blank-corrected with signal from non-transfected cells and normalized to 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells with the corresponding cell density value from the same well. Values are presented as max fluorescence (median fluorescence intensity; MFI) or relative fluorescence units (rfu) per 10 cells. Cell viability at 24 and 48 h is expressed as % of viable cells (based on the death dye) of total number of cells and can be compared to the viability from the non-transfected control cells. This method takes into consideration cell toxicity as a direct result of the transfection and the nucleic acid <em>per se</em> and uses two independent readouts of transfection efficiency: a) the amount of plasmid nucleic acid that cells have taken up during transfection b) the amount of the encoded expressed protein. In summary, we provide a relatively simple, rapid and robust flow cytometric method that can be used as a tool to optimize transfection efficiency.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34063">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>10% FBS complete culturing medium for 293T<br/>DMEM supplemented with:<br/>10% heat-inactivated FBS<br/>100 unit/ml Penicillin and streptomycin<br/>2 mM L-glutamine</li><li>10% FBS complete culturing medium for Jurkat cells<br/>RPMI1640 supplemented with:<br/>10% heat-inactivated FBS<br/>100 unit/ml Penicillin and Streptomycin<br/>2 mM L-glutamine</li><li>0.02% Tween/PBS<br/>4 Î¼l of Tween 20 in 20 ml PBS<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34064">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">We would like to acknowledge the Center for AIDS Research Virology Core Lab and the Gene and Cellular Therapy Core that are supported by the National Institutes of Health [UCLA Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) NIH/NIAID 5P30 AI028697] and by the UCLA AIDS Institute and the UCLA Council of Bioscience Resources.
