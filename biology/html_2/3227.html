            <h1>Quantification of Cutaneous Ionocytes in Small Aquatic Organisms</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Aquatic organisms have specialized cells called ionocytes that regulate the ionic composition, osmolarity, and acid/base status of internal fluids. In small aquatic organisms such as fishes in their early life stages, ionocytes are typically found on the cutaneous surface and their abundance can change to help cope with various metabolic and environmental factors. Ionocytes profusely express ATPase enzymes, most notably Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, which can be identified by immunohistochemistry. However, quantification of cutaneous ionocytes is not trivial due to the limited cameraâs focal plane and the microscopeâs field-of-view. This protocol describes a technique to consistently and reliably identify, image, and measure the relative surface area covered by cutaneous ionocytes through software-mediated focus-stacking and photo-stitchingâthereby allowing the quantification of cutaneous ionocyte area as a proxy for ion transporting capacity across the skin. Because ionocytes are essential for regulating ionic composition, osmolarity, and acid/base status of internal fluids, this technique is useful for studying physiological mechanisms used by fish larvae and other small aquatic organisms during development and in response to environmental stress.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Ionocytes (formerly called chloride cells and mitochondrion-rich cells) are specialized cells that transport ions to regulate the ionic composition, osmolarity, and acid/base status of internal fluids (reviewed in Evans <em>et al.</em>, 2005). Ionocytes typically express high levels of the enzyme Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, which can be used to visualize them using immunohistochemical techniques. In larval and juvenile fishes, ionocytes are present throughout the skin (reviewed in Varsamos <em>et al.</em>, 2005). The abundance, distribution, and size of ionocytes can change during development, as well as in response to environmental stressors such as temperature, acidification, salinity, hypoxia, UV light, and pollutants. However, accurate and consistent quantification of cutaneous ionocytes can be difficult due to their presence in large numbers (tens of thousands), non-homogenous distribution, and being masked by pigmented cells. In addition, ionocyte quantification throughout the entire skin of an organism is often limited by the microscopeâs field-of-view (Fridman <em>et al.</em>, 2011) and both the cameraâs field-of-view and focal plane (Hiroi <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Varsamos <em>et al.</em>, 2002). Because ionocyte distribution is often quite variable across the larval skin, estimations of ionocyte abundance based on a single photograph and focal plane may not be representative of the organism as a whole, and therefore not reliable or repeatable. As such, previous studies that utilized immunohistochemistry to identify and quantify ionocytes have been descriptive in nature (Hwang, 1989; Hiroi <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Katoh <em>et al.</em>, 2000), which precludes replication and comparison across species and treatments. <br/><br/>Here, we describe a protocol involving immunohistochemistry, photo-microscopy, and photo-editing software that allows estimating ionocyte number, size, density, and relative coverage of cutaneous ionocytes with high accuracy. Unlike previous studies, our method resolves both frame-of-view and focal plane limitations through focus-stacking and photo-stitching software, effectively digitizing a 3-D fish larva into a 2-D image. Additionally, the resulting digital image retains its high-resolutionâthereby allowing the accurate quantification of all ionocytes on one side of the larva along with their average size and the larvaâs surface area. These parameters can then be inputted into a simple equation to estimate the cutaneous ionocyte ion-transporting capacity in relation to the total skin surface area of the specimen. For larger specimens in which counting all cutaneous ionocytes is cumbersome and time-consuming, we developed a random sampling protocol that allows highly accurate cutaneous ionocyte estimations after counting ionocytes within 10% of the skin surface area. For example, the estimated number of cutaneous ionocytes in a 13.7 mm long Yellowfin Tuna (<em>Thunnus albacares</em>) specimen was 15,342, which was only 3.6% higher than the actual 14,795 cutaneous ionocytes counted in the entire fish skin (Kwan <em>et al.</em>, 2019). We believe this method will be valuable for future studies quantifying cutaneous ionocytes in larval and juvenile fish as well as other small aquatic organisms during development and in response to various environmental stress (<em>e.g.</em>, ocean warming, hypoxia, and acidification).<br/></p>

In Kwan <em>et al.</em>, 2019, we examined the relationships of relative ionocyte area across standard length and days post hatching using linear regressions. The slope of the linear regression explains the steepness of the line, with the null hypothesis being zero, whereas R<sup>2</sup> describes the regressionâs goodness-of-fit. Other developmental metrics that may be applicable include accumulated thermal units and total length of the sample. Development may not always be linear; therefore, researchers should choose their own regressions according to your field of study. If the experiment includes multiple treatments or species, the comparison of the regressionâs slope should be examined with <em>t</em>-test (2 treatments total) or Analysis of Covariance (3 or more treatments).
