            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The Morris water maze (MWM) is one of the most commonly used tests for assessing spatial learning and memory in mice. While the MWM is highly amenable to testing the effects of memory modifying drugs, most studies do not consider the timing or duration of drug exposure when conducting the MWM assay; factors that can strongly influence the effect of the drug on different stages of memory and interfere with data interpretation. Herein we describe a MWM protocol which offers the advantage of distinguishing the impact of a fast acting intraperitoneally (IP) injected drug on the different stages of spatial memory: acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval. Mice initially undergo habituation to both the MWM apparatus and IP injection procedure over the course of three days. For assessing the effect of a drug on memory acquisition, mice are injected with the drug prior to training sessions over four consecutive days, where mice learn to find an escape platform in a circular water tank using distal spatial cues. To determine the effect of the drug on memory consolidation, mice are injected with the drug immediately after each training session. For testing the effect of a drug on memory retrieval, mice receive mock IP injections on each training day and the drug is IP injected only once, prior to a probe trial, where mice attempt to locate the platform following its removal from the tank. This protocol provides a simple strategy for distinguishing the effect(s) of a CNS acting drug on the different stages of memory.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Numerous studies in rodents have demonstrated that memory is a process generally considered to occur during several stages: acquisition, consolidation and retrieval (Abel and Lattal, 2001). The acquisition phase is better known as learning, while consolidation is a labile phase during which the memory trace is stored. The standard model of memory consolidation posits that task engagement initially triggers intracellular signaling cascades and activation of immediate early gene (IEG) expression, within minutes to hours after learning, and ultimately elicits long-term synaptic changes primarily within the hippocampus (Dudai, 2004). Over time, hippocampal activity is theorized to promote extra-hippocampal consolidation, particularly in the neocortex, in a process termed âsystems consolidationâ that is largely independent of the hippocampus (Dudai, 2004). However, recent studies suggest that hippocampal and neocortical consolidation occur concurrently, and rapidly, after <em>de novo</em> learning (Runyan <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Memory retrieval takes place during re-exposure to the learning context and is believed to involve reactivation of patterns of neural activity in hippocampal and neocortical networks associated with the original learning experience (Ben-Yakov <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Surgical or chemical strategies that interfere with acquisition, consolidation and retrieval stages have shed light on the underlying processes of memory formation (Broadbent <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Bast <em>et al.</em>, 2005).<br/><br/>The Morris water maze (MWM) was originally developed by Richard Morris in order to test spatial learning and memory in rats (Morris, 1984). The MWM is a hippocampus dependent behavioral task in which rodents are placed in a circular pool filled with opaque water and learn to find (and climb up on) an escape platform hidden just below the water surface at an unchanging location within the pool. Initially, rodents placed in the pool find the escape platform by random navigation. However, over repeated training trials, mice slowly learn the escape platform location using objects or symbols placed outside the maze as cues, and progressively swim to the platform in a shorter time (decreased escape latency). This visuospatial task is a reliable test for rats and mice, and more recently in humans using an analogous virtual task (Kallai <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Zhong <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The popularity of the MWM task has resulted in the development of a plethora of different versions that vary in utility (D'Hooge and De Deyn, 2001). Generalized MWM protocols for mice have been described elsewhere ( Wenk, 2004; Choi <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Vorhees and Williams, 2006; Bromley-Brits <em>et al.</em>, 2011) and modified MWM protocols adapted for use with various strains, environments, genetics and ages have also been developed (Bromley-Brits <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Barnhart <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Weitzner <em>et al.</em>, 2015; De Coninck <em>et al.</em>, 2017).<br/><br/>Various pharmacological, genetic and lesion approaches have helped to define the brain regions, neural pathways and molecular processes involved in different stages of spatial memory using the MWM. Although lesion studies can be informative for discerning brain regions and neural circuits required for memory formation, the permanence of many types of lesions makes it difficult to precisely determine which stage(s) of memory the lesion affected. However, the MWM is highly amenable for testing the effects of injectable drugs on spatial memory. In many studies, memory modifying drugs are typically administered for a prolonged period of time or simply prior to the beginning of testing. The duration and timing of drug administration can have profound effects on the different stages of memory, thereby precluding proper determination of drug effects on learning or memory. Relatively few studies have attempted to systematically modify the timing of drug treatment during the MWM assay in order to tease apart the effect of the agent on learning/acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of spatial memory (Da and Takahashi, 2002; Florian and Roullet, 2004; Hou <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Bonini <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Herein we outline a protocol for distinguishing the influence of an intraperitoneally (IP) injected fast acting drug on different spatial learning and memory components.</p>

The averages +/- standard error for latency to find platform or path length for each trial should be plotted for each training day (Figure 4) and a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures can be used to detect the effect of the drug treatment, as well as the learning curve over the course of training days. A lack of decreased escape latency or path length to find the platform during training is indicative of compromised memory acquisition or consolidation. Average swimming speed should be measured over training as a control to ensure that the test drug has no adverse effects on locomotor ability.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917231319_6044.jpg" width="216"/><br/><strong>Figure 4. Representative Data for drug-mediated effects on memory acquisition.</strong> Average latency to find the platform (A), path length (B) and mean speed (C) for mice across all four trials for each training day. Total distance traveled (D) and percent time spent in target quadrant (E) for mice on Probe 1. The number of times mice enter the area where the platform was previously located during training for probe 1 (F) and probe 2 (G). Latency for mice to find the flagged platform on the final flag trial (H). Data is presented as mean and SEM (n = 7). No less than seven mice are recommended for each group. However, a larger number of mice may be required in order to detect statistically significant differences between drug and vehicle treated mice if the effect is small. Example data is provided demonstrating a drug showing impact on memory acquisition. Graphs of the same format are to be produced separately for tests of drug impact on memory consolidation and retrieval as well. Injection with drugs showing an impact on either memory consolidation or retrieval is not expected to result in significant differences in latency to find the platform and path length, as seen in (A) and (B) respectively, but is expected to result in reductions of percent time in target quadrant, as seen in (E), or the number of platform entries, as seen in (F) and (G) during probe trials. <br/><br/>For the probe trial the average percent time spent in the target quadrant or number of platform entries should be plotted and an unpaired <em>t</em>-test can be used to detect differences between drug and vehicle treatment. A decrease in time spent in the target quadrant or the number of platform entries is indicative of compromised memory retrieval. The total distance traveled or average swimming speed over the course of the probe trial can be measured as a control to ensure that the test drug has no effect on locomotor ability. Finally, the latency for mice to find the flagged platform on the final flag trial should also be plotted. For training phases and probe trials, a Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction for significance threshold should be implemented depending on how many measures are used to evaluate the effect of the drug on spatial memory. For example, if both the average percent time spent in the target quadrant and the number of platform entries are used to evaluate spatial memory during the probe trial (two independent hypotheses to be tested), then the significance threshold of <em>Î±</em> &lt; 0.05 should be divided by 2 to yield a corrected threshold of <em>Î±</em> &lt; 0.025. Statistical analysis can be performed using RStudio v0.97.551.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29388">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Drugs that interfere with memory acquisition and consolidation will result in a longer latency to find the platform and a longer distance traveled compared to vehicle-injected mice. However, it is important that no differences in mean swimming speed during training trials and total distance traveled during the probe tests are observed between drug and vehicle treatments as this would indicate that the drug may affect swimming performance or motivation to find the platform, possibly confounding the analysis. In addition, to ensure that the drug has no adverse effect on visual acuity, no significant difference in the ability to find the flagged platform should be observed between vehicle and drug-treated mice. </li><li>Occasionally some animals are unmotivated to escape and simply float. In this case, the mouse should remain in the MWM until the end of the trial. If it floats again on the second trial, then it should be returned to its cage and tested again the next day. If the animal now swims on the subsequent day of testing, then testing should be continued with the mouse but will be staggered one day behind the other animals in the testing schedule. If the animal fails to swim on the second day, then it should be excluded from further testing. In addition, some mice initially tend to swim along the wall of the pool (thigmotaxic or wall-hugging swimming). This behavior is generally reflective of anxiety and stress, although the extensive habituation in this protocol tends to reduce anxiety in mice. Animals that persist with a thigmotaxic strategy during the training trials and probe test cannot be excluded unless they fail to find the platform during the flag trial at the end of the assay. Anxiety effects can be measured explicitly using additional tests such as the elevated plus maze, elevated zero maze, light/dark test, or open field test. </li><li>It has been suggested that the multiple training sessions used in the MWM over 4 days may result in memory traces that are reactivated and reconsolidated during each learning session, possibly obscuring events associated with the initial consolidation of a spatial memory (Florian and Roullet, 2004). An alternative one day massed-training protocol has been developed whereby mice are submitted to four consecutive trial sessions within a 70-90 min period followed by a probe trial 24 h later (Florian and Roullet, 2004; Stein <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Villain <em>et al.</em>, 2016). The one day protocol has the advantage that it can expose the effects of drug treatment on early consolidation after the training sessions without the complication of overlapping reconsolidation processes during multiday training protocols (Stein <em>et al.</em>, 2014). However, potential problems with using the massed training include poorer establishment of a memory trace and the potential of hypothermic effects. Intrahippocampal injection of a protein kinase C (PKC) chemical inhibitor in rats revealed impaired spatial memory consolidation using either the one day massed or multi-day training protocols of the MWM (Bonini <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Thus injection of drugs in the post-training phase using the multiday protocol can discern effects of the drug on the consolidation process, with the caveat that reconsolidation processes may also be affected. </li><li>Some cellular aspects of memory consolidation may take place within 30 min of the initial exposure to training (Runyan <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Since injection of a drug to assess for effects on memory consolidation occurs at the end of each training session (~40 min in duration), some of the early stages of consolidation may not be fully affected using this protocol. However, the effect of a drug on consolidation, using a massed training protocol for the MWM, has been noted 70 minutes after training (Villian <em>et al.</em>, 2016). </li><li>Mice are more susceptible to hyperthermia in the MWM than rats (Iivonen <em>et al.</em>, 2003). The risk of hyperthermia is mitigated by ensuring the water temperature is maintained at 24 Â°C throughout the protocol, thoroughly drying mice after removal from the water, keeping home cages warm on heating mats, and ensuring inter-trial intervals are no less than 10 min. This is of particular importance if using aged or transgenic mice.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29389">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Sterile saline solution (0.9% w/v NaCl) <br/>Dissolve 9 g of NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich) and filter sterilizing using a 0.2 Âµm filter unit (Thermo Scientific)<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29390">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This research was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Grant 355803-2013 and Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging Grant 137794.
