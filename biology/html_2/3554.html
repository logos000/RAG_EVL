            <h1>Method for Measuring Mucociliary Clearance and Cilia-generated Flow in Mice by <em>ex vivo</em> Imaging</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Eric  Song, Akiko Iwasaki</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><em>Ex vivo</em> biophysical measurements provide valuable insights into understanding both physiological and pathogenic processes. One critical physiological mechanism that is regulated by these biophysical properties is cilia-generated flow that mediates mucociliary clearance, which is known to provide protection against foreign particles and pathogens in the upper airway. To measure ciliary clearance, several techniques have been implemented, including the use of radiolabeled particles and imaging with single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) methods. Although non-invasive, these tests require the use of specialized equipment, limiting widespread use. Here we describe a method of <em>ex vivo</em> imaging of cilia-generated flow, adapted from previously reported methods, to make it more accessible and higher throughput for researchers. We excise trachea from mice quickly after euthanasia, cut it longitudinally and place it in an inhouse made slide. We apply fluorescent particles to measure particle movement under a fluorescent microscope, followed by analysis with ImageJ, allowing calculation of fluid flow generated by cilia under different conditions. This method enables <em>ex vivo</em> measurements in tissue with minimal investment or special equipment, giving opportunity to investigate and discover important biophysical properties associated with ciliary movement of the trachea in physiology and disease.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The composition of diverse biophysical properties, each aiding a specified function, make up the human body. A key example of this is the generation of flow in many different organ systems, including the central nervous system (Olstad <em>et al.</em>, 2019), reproductive tracts (Afzelius <em>et al.</em>, 1978; Yuan <em>et al.</em>, 2019) and the pulmonary system (Satir and Sleigh, 1990), made by specialized ciliated cells. Understanding how the environment or external stimuli affect these processes can give us insights into disease. In our recent study (Kudo <em>et al.</em>, 2019), we explored how humidity affects influenza infections in a mouse model. By using this method of <em>ex-vivo</em> measurement of cilia-generated flow in mice, we were able to visually measure how ambient humidity altered the rate of virus clearance (Figures 1 and 2). Previous studies have used radiolabeled particles to measure mucociliary clearance using a noninvasive method (Hua <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Bustamante-Marin and Ostrowski, 2017). However, this requires the use of radioactive materials and SPECT or other machines to measure radioactivity that may not be readily available. Measurements like this can be made more accessible using <em>ex vivo</em> imaging of particles in tissue (Nance <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Francis and Lo, 2013; Mastorakos <em>et al.</em>, 2015 and 2016). Here, we describe a detailed method of measuring the flow generated by cilia in upper airway tissue, adapted from Francis and Lo (2013). Our method is easy to perform and allows for measurement of large numbers of mice at a relatively low cost. This protocol can also be performed in a short time, allowing for the preservation of biological differences and measurement in a large number of animals. Finally, it can be adopted for other organ systems or tissues, measuring various biophysical properties, as shown by Nance <em>et al.</em> (2012), in identifying what criteria drug loaded particles must meet to navigate through brain parenchyma. Altogether, this protocol will provide researchers with an easy to follow, step-by-step methodology to measure properties of biological tissues <em>ex vivo</em> (Figure 3).</p>

This is the plane of the tissue, where particles are attached/engulfed to the mucus/cells on the surface. From there move focus up a set amount for each image. This is important because the measurement of the flow generated by cilia will change as a function of the distance away from the surface of the cilia. Thus, to generate data that can be compared between samples, this distance must be kept constant (refer to Video 2). In our experiments, we used a distance of ~1 Î¼m distance from the surface of the cilia.<br/><br/><!--video3554-2å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3554-2" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3554-2"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(2)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3554/3554-2s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 2.

Practice to get a good flow going, or work in pairs to have one person dissect while another sets up the microscope in order to set up an optimal imaging condition. As a positive control of cilia movement regulation, mice housed in higher ambient humidity (~50%) will show higher cilia particle velocity (Kudo et al., 2019). As a negative control, mouse housed in lower ambient humidity can be used, or trachea that has be excised for a prolonged time period (&gt; 10 min) can be used.</em><br/></li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32332">### Data analysis</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Load data into FIJI/ImageJ using File &gt; Import &gt; Image sequence.</li><li>Analyze particle velocity using Plugins &gt; Tracking &gt; MTrack2 (<a href="https://imagej.net/MTrack2" target="_blank">https://imagej.net/MTrack2</a>).<br/><em>Note: Use imageJ settings Image &gt; Adjust &gt; Brightness/Contrast to ensure a high signal to noise ratio.
