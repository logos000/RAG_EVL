            <h1>Displaced Object Recognition Memory in Rats</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ali N. Mclagan, Jena B. Hales</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The Displaced Object Recognition (DOR) task, sometimes called the Novel Object Location task, assesses spatial recognition memory without navigational demands, explicit instruction, or the need for multiple days of training. This memory task has two phases. First, the subject is familiarized to an open arena with two objects and is allowed to explore the objects. Following a delay period, the subject returns to the arena, but one of the previous objects has been moved to a new location. Greater exploration of the displaced object is used as the index of memory for the previous object location. An advantage of the DOR task is that subjects can be tested without explicit training, since this task exploits the natural tendency to be more interested in something novel. The spontaneous aspect of this task allows for the testing of animals as well as human populations that are unable to follow verbal instructions, such as babies. Therefore, this powerful test of recognition memory can be administered similarly for many species, including rats and humans, allowing for better translatability. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Animal models are critical for developing a better understanding of human memory function and dysfunction. Early animal studies examining memory dysfunction reported the critical importance of the hippocampus and surrounding cortical regions within the medial temporal lobes (Winocur, 1990; Zola-Morgan and Squire, 1990; Squire <em>et al.</em>, 2001). One area of memory function that has been found to be particularly dependent on the hippocampus is spatial memory formation and retrieval. Many of the spatial memory tasks which are most sensitive to hippocampal damage or disruption are those that involve navigation, such as the radial arm maze, Barnes maze, and Morris Watermaze (Clark <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Although such tasks are valuable, there are some limitations and potential confounds in using tasks that require navigation. For example, certain populations may have difficulty in navigating, but can still form and retrieve spatial memories. In addition, the performance aspect of navigation, independent of the spatial memory, may require the recruitment of additional brain areas. Therefore, it is important to have tests of spatial memory that are non-navigational. The DOR task provides a means for assessing spatial memory recognition without the animal having to navigate to a learned reference location in order to express the memory. </p>

Familiarization and testing lengths of 15-min allow enough time for the animal to explore the objects. The three-hour delay interval has been used successfully to show a hippocampal-dependent memory effect using the Novel Object Recognition task previously (Broadbent </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2010). Shorter time delays may not show hippocampal dependency, and longer time delays can lead to weaker memories in control animals.</em> <br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="102" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190414/20190414183830_8194.jpg" width="143"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

Select âSumâ for keys 1 and 2. <br/><br/></li><li>Start the video file, and press âbeginâ on the ODLog 2 program as soon as the rat is placed into the apparatus. Place your left index finger on the left on key â1â, which corresponds to the left object on the screen, and right index finger on the right on key â2â, which corresponds to the right object on the screen. As soon as the rat places its nose up to an object to explore it (as shown in Figure 2), press down the corresponding key and keep it pressed down until the rat leaves the object or turns its head away, at which point, pick up your finger. It is important to be consistent in using the same scoring criteria for all rats.</li><li>Do not score if the rat is chewing the objects, climbing on the objects, or sniffing above, behind, or next to the objects.</li><li>Score the behavior until the rat reaches 30 s of total object exploration (the program will automatically stop once this summed value is reached). Save the summary document (yellow screen that pops up) and save the data file (txt document) before closing the program. Close the program after scoring each animal. A 30 s limit of total object exploration is used based on previous research using the Novel Object Recognition task, which showed the highest preference for the novel object to be within the first 30 s (after which, the novel object gains familiarity).</li><li>Open the program to score the next video file.</li><li>Enter data into an Excel spreadsheet with the following columns:<ol class="npwthree"><li>Subject #</li><li>Group: this could be a within-subjects group or a between-subjects group label</li><li>Displaced Side (L/R): was the object on the left (L) or the right (R) displaced?</li><li>Time L: time spent exploring the object on the left</li><li>Time R: time spent exploring the object on the right</li><li>Time Displaced: time spent exploring the displaced object (equal to either Time L or Time R)</li><li>Total Time: how long the rat was in the apparatus before reaching 30 s of object exploration</li><li>Total % Displaced (Time Displaced/30 * 100).</li></ol></li><li>Calculate % time exploring the displaced object by averaging the âTotal % Displacedâ values for all rats within a group.
