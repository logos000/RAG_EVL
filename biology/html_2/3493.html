            <h1>A Radioactive-free Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Assay Against the <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em> Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 short (<em>Tb</em>GSK-3s)</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Antonia Efstathiou, Despina Smirlis</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The identification of small molecules possessing inhibitory activity <em>in vitro</em>, against a given target kinase, is the first step in the drug discovery process. Herein, we describe a non radioactive protocol using luciferase-based ATP assay for the identification of inhibitors for the short isoform of the <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>âs Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (<em>Tb</em>GSK-3s). <em>Tb</em>GSK-3s represents a potential drug target as it is essential for parasite survival. Small molecules used in our study are indirubin analogues possessing substitutions in different positions in the bis-indole backbone. Presently, the standard laboratory practice for the kinase assays is the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate from [gamma-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP as the efforts for developing non-radioactive assays (ELISA-based assays, fluorescence quenching assays, <em>etc.</em>) exhibit limitations such as lack in sensitivity or limitations for broad applications. This protocol can be a useful starting point for lead discovery, as it surpasses the drawbacks of radioactive kinase assays and it allows for relatively sensitive measurements of kinase inhibition for <em>Tb</em>GSK-3s.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in biological processes including differentiation, cell proliferation and apoptosis, by putting in motion signaling pathways upon catalyzing the transfer of the Î³-phosphate from ATP to substrate (Jia <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Efstathiou <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Deregulation of kinases can frequently lead to a variety of diseases (Ways and Sheetz, 2000; Cohen and Goedert, 2004; Mazitschek and Giannis, 2004; Resnick and Fennell, 2004) and therefore, they are considered one of the largest classes of drug targets (Cohen 1999; Manning <em>et al.</em>, 2002). The first step of the lead kinase inhibitor discovery is the establishment of an <em>in vitro</em> kinase assay. The radioactive assays are the standard laboratory practice due to their high sensitivity (Jia <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Lilienthal <em>et al.</em>, 2010). However, drawbacks of kinase-based radioactivity assays include the need of special handling and the restriction in flexibility because of the short half-life of <sup>32</sup>P. To resolve these limitations, new non-radioactive technologies have been created that are based on fluorescence or luminescence (Jia <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Herein, we describe a non radioactive protocol using luciferase-based ATP assay, for the identification of inhibitors for the short isoform of the <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>âs Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (<em>Tb</em>GSK-3s). In the bloodstream form of <em>T. brucei</em>, <em>Tb</em>GSK-3s is essential for survival (Ojo <em>et al.</em>, 2008) and therefore it is a molecular target for the discovery of new anti-trypanosomal agents (Ojo <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Oduor <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Woodland <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Urich <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Swinney <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Mammalian GSK-3 has been related to a wide range of diseases and thus small molecular weight GSK-3 inhibitors has been developed (Woodland <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Gaboriaud-Kola <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Masch and Kunick, 2015). Amongst GSK-3 inhibitors, there are the indirubins, a family of natural bis-indole derivatives (Hoessel <em>et al.</em>, 1999, Polychronopoulos <em>et al.</em>, 2004, Vougogiannopoulou <em>et al.</em>, 2008, Myrianthopoulos <em>et al.</em>, 2013). In this protocol, a luminescent kinase assay based on the Kinase-Glo<sup>Â®</sup> reagent of Promega, is described. This method is straightforward, radioactive-free, fast and it doesnât lack sensitivity. While the protocol described below is specific for the recombinant <em>Tb</em>GSK-3s expressed in baculovirus system as described before (Efstathiou <em>et al.</em>, 2019), it can be applicable to any kinase with the appropriate alterations for the specific kinase (substrate, ATP concentration, buffer, <em>etc.</em>).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200112/20200112001231_8263.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Scheme for the luminescent kinase assay based on the Kinase-Glo<sup>Â®</sup> reagent.</strong> The kinase reaction is conducted under the appropriate conditions with or without inhibitors. The remaining ATP at the time that the reagent is added, is used as a substrate by the Kinase-Glo<sup>Â®</sup> Luciferase to catalyze the mono-oxygenation of luciferin. The luciferase reaction produces one photon of light per turnover. Luminescence is inversely related to kinase activity (Promega).</p>
