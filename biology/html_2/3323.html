            <h1>Solid Phase PCR on 3D Microstructure ArrayChip for Pathogen Detection Application</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Krishna Kant, Tien Anh Ngo</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Advanced free angle photolithography (FAPL) is presented for making 3D supercritical angle fluorescence (SAF) microstructures and transfer them on to polymeric chips using injection molding technique for low-cost microfluidic devices embedded with optical sensing structures. A solid phase polymerase chain reaction (SP-PCR) is used as model technique, which allows rapid and sensitive detection of pathogen DNA on-chip. This article presents the detailed fabrication of SAF structure and SP-PCR application on SAF structure for pathogen detection. This protocol of developing SAF structures using the FAPL process, increases the number of SAF per mm<sup>2</sup>. FAPL was performed via a motorized stage to control the angle of incidence and to achieve the desired bucket-shapes (dimensions of 50 Î¼m to 150 Î¼m with a slope) required for the 3D optical sensing. Due to the unique properties of SAF structures, it enhances the fluorescent signal by 46 times. Increasing the number of SAF structures and reducing the size resulted in reduction of sample volume required per test along with improvement in the limit of detection (LOD) due to a smaller size. This article also presents the experimental details of SP-PCR using DNA oligos bound to the SAF structures for on-chip pathogen detection and a comparison between different sizes of SAF structures. The direct on-chip SP-PCR paves the path for the application of this technique in point-of-care devices.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The role of master mold is crucial to generate defect-free polymer chips in an injection molding process (Klank <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Hong <em>et al.</em>, 2010). This work presents a strategy to maximize on-chip 3D detection sites per mm<sup>2</sup> with reduced defects and improved smoothness. Micro milling technique is conventionally used to make a rapid mold for injection molding. Due to the rough surface of milling bits it can cause defects in microstructures during molding. Significant efforts are being made towards improvement of molds by decreasing surface roughness and defects to achieve a better and smoother polymer chip (Ogilvie <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Adding the novel FAPL (free angle photolithography) process we report here an improved fabrication of SAF structures and their transfer to the master mold and then to the polymeric chip. <br/><br/>The advantage of using SAF structures can be explained if we consider fluorophore molecule available on the front of a generic surface of microstructure: for a generic structure, most of the emitted light onto the material is refracted outside the structure, and only small amount of light passes through to give a signal (Ruckstuhl and Verdes, 2004; Winterflood <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Usually, this refracted fluorescent light is lost or not been gathered when using a flat surface (microscopic polymer slide) for signal capturing. Collection of this remaining part of light by a structure that exhibits supercritical angle of reflection enhances the signal intensity up to 46 times (Hung <em>et al.</em>, 2014). SAF structure offers a higher sensitivity and better view for efficient signal collection compared with the flat surface. Fabrication of SAF with photolithography improves the number of structures on a unit area of chip and reduces the volume of sample required. Incorporation of SAF structures on microfluidic chip in combination with SP-PCR provides the capability of multiplexed SP-PCR reactions on-chip for effective low-cost and compact optical detection platform. Our experimental results demonstrated that with SAF array it achieves ultra-sensitive limit of detection (LoD) for fluorophores. This sensitivity is comparable to that obtained by a conventional microarray with data acquisition from a high-end laser scanner. This SAF array platform is advantageous in terms of having a low cost microfluidic platform, whilst retaining high sensitivity and multiplexing capability.<br/><br/>In this paper, we introduce FAPL fabrication process and demonstrate the possibility of achieving lithography-made SAF (L-SAF) structures with lower surface roughness and higher optical efficiency with respect to our previously described micro-milled SAF (M-SAF) (Hung <em>et al.</em>, 2015). In particular, we present fabrication procedure (Figure 1) for L-SAF structures of different sizes (50 Î¼m, 100 Î¼m, 150 Î¼m). Multiplexed SP-PCR reaction using DNA probes on L-SAF array for on-chip pathogen detection application (Sun <em>et al.</em>, 2011) and our experimental outcomes confirmed that by using these improved SAF arrays, the limit of detection (LOD) could be improved up to 0.05 nM around 6.62 x 10<sup>3</sup> molecules. The LOD is calculated by data obtained from a high-end fluorescent scanner.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190730/20190730194733_5856.jpg" width="104"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

The edge bead removal is performed with the robotic arm of the spin coater by dropping continuously acetone solution (to dissolve photoresist) at the edge and continuous spin at 1000 rpm at the same time). Due to the spinning of the wafer, the solution moves outwards so it does not affect the rest of the coating of Silicon wafer.</li><li>Execute the FAPL process with a mask pattern of round holes with diameters ranging from 50 to 200 Î¼m using hard contact mode.</li><li>Load the wafer into the tilting stage, fixed at a given tilt angle and rotated clockwise at 15 rpm and while delivering a dose of 1500 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> throughout the UV exposure.<br/><em>Note: The photoresist refractive index and the necessity of a 60-degree tilt on the final SAF structures lead to a fixed tilt angle Î¸rot = 52.3 degrees (Figure 1B).</em> </li><li>After the UV exposure, automated equipment (Gamma Cluster System 2M, Suss MicroTech) is used to develop the wafers by exposing them to 10 puddles of AZ726 MIF developer for 60 s. Later, rinse the wafers with deionized water before final drying.</li><li>The sputter Nickel Vanadium (Ni/V) = 80 nm or (Chromium (Cr)/ Gold (Au) = 20/60 nm metal Cr/Au seed bilayer together with sputtering 1 Î¼m thick Aluminum (Al) sacrificial layer (Kurt J Lesker) (Figure 1C).</li><li>Perform the Ni electroplating (Microform.200, Technotrans) in three steps by increasing the current in 3 steps. The current goes up linearly from 0 to 0.5 A during the first 15 min, and from 0.5 to 1.5 A for the next 15 min. As soon as the current reaches up to 17 A, keep it constant for 6 h and after that decline it to 0 with a slow rate. The current density should not drop suddenly to minimize the residual stress and achieve a thickness of 350 Î¼m. </li><li>After electroplating, Si is etched out in a KOH bath at 80 Â°C. Then the remaining Ni shim is cut in required size for installation in injection molding machine (ENGEL Victory 80/45 Tech).</li><li>Use TOPAS 5013L COC pellets for injection molding for polymer chip. The polymers get dry in the hopper of injection molder (airflow at 90 Â°C) and extra moisture is removed.</li><li>The temperature of injection molding cylinder is increased gradually from 250 Â°C as polymer exited the hopper to reach 300 Â°C at the nozzle. Molten COC gets injected into the mold at a speed of 21 cm<sup>3</sup>/s and a pressure of 600 bars as presented in Video 1.</li><li>The mold temperature may vary (Variotherm process) from 155 Â°C (at the moment of injection) to 103 Â°C when the demolding is performed. Also, a packing pressure of injection molding (600 bars) is applied for 6 s injection molded to produce the structures into the microfluidic device. The final chips had the dimensions of a microscope slide (76 mm x 25 mm x 1 mm).<br/><br/><!--video3323-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3323-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3323-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3323/3323-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.

A circle is adjusted to the size of the SAF, and the mean value of grey levels of the pixels inside a fluorescent spot is calculated. A square is drawn surrounding the circle, and the mean signal is taken as background 1. To determine the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the mean of the negative control (NC) fluorescent spots (sample lacking the probe target) is used as background 2 (b2). The SNR in this study is defined as the mean signal intensity of the feature (ave SI) subtracted from the mean background 2 (ave b2) and divided by the variation of the background 2 (stdev b2).
