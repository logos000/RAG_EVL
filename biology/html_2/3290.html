            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is an extra-embryonic organ and thus well accessible for seeding and harvesting 3D cell cultures. Samples from CAM assays are suitable for protein and gene expression analysis as well as for immuno-histochemical studies. Here we present the CAM assay as a possible model to study autophagy in different types of cancer using immunohistochemistry. Compared with other 3D and xenograft models, the CAM assay displays several advantages such as lower costs, shorter experimental times, physiological environment and reproducibility. Macroautophagy hereafter simply referred to as âautophagyâ is a conserved cellular catabolic process that degrades and recycles cellular components. Under basal conditions, autophagy contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis whereas under cellular stress, such as starvation or hypoxia, autophagy is activated as a survival mechanism. Dysregulation of autophagy has been described in many diseases. In cancer, autophagy has been suggested to play a dual role. Whereas autophagy has been reported to play a tumor suppressive role in early stages, it seems to be rather tumor supportive in later stages. Here we provide a method to study autophagy in 3D microtumors of cancer cells grown on the CAM.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is a highly vascularized extra-embryonic membrane that has multiple functions during embryonic development, such as gas exchange (Romanoff, 1960). It is a well-known model to study blood vessels and angiogenesis in the context of tumor biology (Kain <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Nowak-Sliwinska <em>et al.</em>, 2014). The chick development in the egg lasts 21 days (Romanoff, 1960). Three days after starting incubating the eggs, we cut a small round window into the eggshell for easy access to the CAM later in the procedure (Figure 1). At this time point the membrane is not yet formed and thus there is no risk to damage it. On Day 7 of embryo development the tumor cells are seeded on the CAM and seven days later (Day 14) the microtumors that developed on the membrane are harvested and analyzed. To this end, the tumors are excised, fixed, dehydrated, embedded and cut to apply immunohistochemical stainings for the autophagy-related markers: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B, short LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, aka p62). <br/><br/>Experimentally assessing autophagy is challenging, since it is a dynamic process, and steady state expression levels of autophagy related genes do not give a complete picture of the active autophagic process (Barth <em>et al.</em>, 2010). In tissue, dot like staining of LC3B and p62 is considered a better indication of autophagic flux, defined as the degradation rate of cargo via autophagy (Martinet <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Our group previously established an automated LC3B and p62 staining and scoring protocol for tumor tissue (SchlÃ¤fli <em>et al.</em>, 2015), which we apply here on microtumors generated in the CAM model. Using a 3D CAM xenograft model to broaden our knowledge on autophagy in tumor biology has several advantages. It is easy accessible for manipulation (addition of an autophagy blocking agent), for microscopy (for instance to analyze the growth and vascularization of the tumors) and it provides small tumors that are suitable for immunohistochemical analyses. Thus, the expression of different markers can be visualized in the tissue.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190630/20190630180828_2214.jpg" width="221"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Overview of the workflow.</strong> The development of the chicken in the egg takes in total 21 days. At Day 3 of incubation, when the CAM is not yet formed a window is cut into the eggshell. At Day 7 of incubation when the membrane is visible but not yet completely developed the cancer cells are seeded in a collagen scaffold and then transferred to the membrane. After another 7 days in the incubator, at Day 14 of development the tumor is harvested, fixed and embedded.</p>

In a first step, a small hole is punched into the eggshell at the âbottomâ of the egg (A). Then, around 3 ml of albumen are removed using a syringe and the hole is closed with adhesive tape (B). Another stripe of tape is glued on the side of the egg (C). A window is cut in the area of the scotch to avoid eggshell crumbs to fall on the membrane, using sharp scissors (D). Finally, the window is closed with an additional stripe of tape (E).<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Preparation of collagen scaffolds (24 h before seeding)<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Work in a laminar flow hood.

Then the part of the CAM around the tumor is excised (B), sandwiched between two embedding sponges (C) and placed in an embedding mold (D).

In the overview picture, glandular structures newly formed by the OE19 esophageal adenocarcinoma tumor cells (T) can be observed. The micro tumors that developed in the CAM assay are comparable to tumors formed from OE19 cells in mouse xenograft models (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Some tumor OE19 cells show invasive growth into the stroma. In addition, parts of the collagen scaffold (SC), blood vessels (BV) in the lower part of the micro tumor and the epithelial layers of the CAM can be seen. Tumor cells are made visible by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using pan-Cytokeratin staining. A high proliferation activity was demonstrated by Ki67 staining (human specific). Overexpression of Her2 in tumor cells was also demonstrated by IHC staining (for antibody information see âRecipesâ). <br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190630/20190630184044_3189.jpg" width="151"/><br/><strong>Figure 4. Immunohistochemical stains of the tumor in the CAM.</strong> OE19 esophageal adenocarcinoma cells (1 x 10<sup>6</sup> inoculated on CAM for 7 days). SC = scaffold; BV = blood vessels; T = tumor and CAM = chorioallantoic membrane. Shown here are stains with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E); and human specific IHC stains: pan-cytokeratin (PanCK), an epithelial marker; HER2, a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is amplified in OE19 cells and Ki-67 that is associated with proliferation.<br/><br/>Before seeding OE19 cells, one group was treated with an early stage autophagy inhibitor VPS34-IN1, which is considered rather specific for macroautophagy (Bago <em>et al.</em>, 2014). The inhibitor was applied at a concentration of 5 ÂµM to the cells before seeding them on the CAM.<br/>These are the same concentrations we used before for in vitro experiments (Janser <em>et al.</em>, 2018). After excision and staining with the autophagy markers LC3B and p62 untreated and pretreated tumors were compared (Figure 5). Where in the untreated sample the stainings for p62 and LC3 are continuous, the staining pattern of the VPS34-IN1 treated sample shows clearly dot formation. We already showed that VPS34-IN1 inhibits macroautophagy in vitro in OE19 cells (Janser <em>et al.</em>, 2018), thus this is a clear indication that we can capture blocked autophagy in microtumors grown in the CAM model. As the CAM represents a relatively cheap 3D tumor model allowing to assess several parameters (IHC, microscopy), this could be the method of choice to complement in vitro data and gain more insight into the role of autophagy in cancer.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190630/20190630184109_2631.jpg" width="160"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.

In the magnifications, the dot-like structures of the autophagy markers indicative for ongoing macroautophagy are clearly visible.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28314">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>The protocol was established with OE19 esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. Additionally, we tested a panel of breast cancer cell lines (SKBR3, T47D and MCF7) and two colon cancer cell lines (LS174T, CaCo2) with which we observed good results as well.</li><li>The collagen scaffold is easier to handle than Matrigel<sup>Â®</sup> also resulting in better grafting. Since the collagen sponge absorbs the cell suspensions, fewer cells were lost in the seeding step compared to our experiments with Matrigel<sup>Â®</sup> scaffolds.</li><li>During manipulation outside the incubator the eggs should not get cold. Thus, there is a much higher success rate in terms of survival of embryos if only one egg is handled at a time and every working step is well prepared.</li><li>Depending on which cell line will be used tumor cells will grow better on the CAM when seeded in serum free medium.</li><li>The cell number seeded onto the collagen scaffold on the CAM can vary from cell line to cell line. Usually, between 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> and 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells are seeded.</li><li>This CAM protocol has been optimized to assess autophagy in a 3D-model. Generally, this improved CAM protocol allows to determine other aspects of tumor biology as well, <em>e.g.</em>, invasion of genetically modified or treated cancer cells into the CAM, and cell death by immunohistochemical staining for cleaved caspase-3. Using a collagen sponge as a scaffold could improve CAM assays for therapy response studies of cancer cells in 3D.</li><li>The tumor cells can be labeled with EGFP, mCherry or other fluorescent proteins (Figure 6). This will facilitate localization of the microtumors on the CAM for excision (sometimes the tumors are transparent and difficult to find). Another advantage of labeling the cells is that there is an indication whether a microtumor formed and how big it is. If there is a new tumor visible, there is no need to continue with the procedure. Moreover, the intensity of the fluorescence can be used as a viability read out as well.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190630/20190630184135_1896.jpg" width="101"/><br/><strong>Figure 6. mCherry and EGFP labeled tumor cells in the CAM.</strong> mCherry labeled MCF7 breast cancer cells.
