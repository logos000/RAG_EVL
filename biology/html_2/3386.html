            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Salivary glands consist of multiple phenotypically and functionally unique cell populations, such as the acinar, ductal, and myoepithelial cells that help produce, modify, and secrete saliva (Lombaert <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Identification of mechanisms and factors that regulate these populations has been of key interest, as salivary gland-related diseases have detrimental effects on these cell populations. A variety of approaches have been used to understand the roles different signaling mechanisms and transcription factors play in regulating salivary gland development and homeostasis. Differentiation assays have been performed with primary salivary cells in the past (Maimets <em>et al.</em>, 2016), however this approach may sometimes be limiting due to tissue availability, labor intensity of processing the tissue samples, and/or inability to long-term passage the cells. Here we describe in detail a 3D differentiation assay to analyze the differentiation potential of a salivary gland cell line, SIMS, which was immortalized from an adult mouse submandibular salivary gland (Laoide <em>et al.</em>, 1996). SIMS cells express cytokeratin 7 and 19, which is characteristic for a ductal cell type. Although adult acinar and myoepithelial cells were found <em>in vivo</em> to preserve their own cell population through self-duplication (Aure <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Song <em>et al.</em> 2018), in some cases duct cells can differentiate into acinar cells <em>in vivo</em>, such as after radiation injury (Lombaert <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Weng <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Thus, utilization of SIMS cells allows us to target and analyze the self-renewal and differentiation effects of ductal cells under specific <em>in vitro</em> controlled conditions.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><em>In vitro</em> differentiation assays are a remarkable tool that enables us to analyze the potency of cells without relying on <em>in vivo</em> models. Cells in these assays can be manipulated for gene expression to, for instance, analyze their differentiation ability. While previous protocols have described the differentiation potential of primary salivary gland cells <em>in vitro</em>, our protocol is optimized for the use of the SIMS cell line (Laoide <em>et al.</em>, 1996; Maimets <em>et al.</em>, 2016). SIMS cells express cytokeratin 7 and 19, which is characteristic for a ductal cell type. Although adult acinar and myoepithelial cells were found <em>in vivo</em> to preserve their own cell population through self-duplication (Aure <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Song <em>et al.</em> 2018), in some cases duct cells can differentiate into acinar cells <em>in vivo</em>, such as after radiation injury (Lombaert <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Weng <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Thus, utilization of SIMS cells allows us to target and analyze the self-renewal and differentiation effects of ductal cells under specific <em>in vitro</em> controlled conditions. Our recent work shows that SIMS cells have the ability to differentiate into unique populations of acinar, myoepithelial, and duct cells in 3D differentiation conditions, that normally produce, modify and secrete saliva <em>in vivo</em> (Lombaert <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Athwal <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This protocol describes the workflow necessary for the generation and analysis of 3D differentiated SIMS cells. SIMS cells are cultured in a 3D matrigel/collagen matrix over a period of 7-9 days. Matrigel is a solubilized basement membrane preparation extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma, which is rich in several growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin-1, collagen IV, and heparin sulfate proteoglycans (Patel <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Matrigel has been shown to induce differentiation of stem/progenitor cells and outgrowth of already differentiated cell types by causing polarization of cells embedded in or on top of it. For SIMS grown in this 3D matrix, organoid formation post single cell culture is apparent around day 5 of culture. These organoids are also stained either via cryosectioning or in 3D to analyze for differentiation markers and cell populations. Alterations, such as cell transfections, transductions and/or media changes, to this condition can easily be made to address specific research questions (Athwal <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The media components were adjusted using literature from both existing salivary and mammary gland differentiation protocols, which deemed necessary to induce differentiation of the SIMS cells <em>in vitro</em>. Here we show the robust use of this cell line to address specific research questions without having to rely on primary salivary gland cells. </p>
