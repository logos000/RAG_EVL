            <h1>Application of Mechanical Forces on <em>Drosophila</em> Embryos by Manipulation of Microinjected Magnetic Particles</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Arturo DâAngelo, JÃ©rÃ´me Solon</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cells generate mechanical forces to shape tissues during morphogenesis. These forces can activate several biochemical pathways and trigger diverse cellular responses by mechano-sensation, such as differentiation, division, migration and apoptosis. Assessing the mechano-responses of cells in living organisms requires tools to apply controlled local forces within biological tissues. For this, we have set up a method to generate controlled forces on a magnetic particle embedded within a chosen tissue of <em>Drosophila</em> embryos. We designed a protocol to inject an individual particle in early embryos and to position it, using a permanent magnet, within the tissue of our choice. Controlled forces in the range of pico to nanonewtons can be applied on the particle with the use of an electromagnet that has been previously calibrated. The bead displacement and the epithelial deformation upon force application can be followed with live imaging and further analyzed using simple analysis tools. This method has been successfully used to identify changes in mechanics in the blastoderm before gastrulation. This protocol provides the details, (i) for injecting a magnetic particle in <em>Drosophila</em> embryos, (ii) for calibrating an electromagnet and (iii) to apply controlled forces in living tissues.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> embryogenesis is a classical model for morphogenesis (Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1985). While many tools have been developed to assess the role of specific proteins in morphogenesis, assessing cellular forces or mechanics still remains challenging. For the last fifteen years, laser dissection has been the most commonly used approach to assess cellular forces (Colombelli and Solon, 2013; Shivakumar and Lenne, 2016). However, laser dissection is invasive, it wounds tissues, and does not facilitate the application of ectopic forces. To overcome these limitations, a few methods have been developed to probe the mechanics of tissues by inducing deformations in droplets of magnetic fluid or through the optical trapping of cellular junctions (Bambardekar <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Serwane <em>et al.</em>, 2017). These methods have a limited range of force and require specific, complex instrumentation. Here, we present the protocol for an alternative, versatile and low-cost method for applying controlled forces within an epithelium of a living <em>Drosophila</em> embryo (DâAngelo <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This method relies on the injection of a magnetic particle within a living embryo and on the application of a magnetic field with an electromagnet. Since the magnetic particle is coated with GBP nanobody, it is possible to target a specific intracellular attachment. Here, we injected the bead in a fly line expressing GFP at the plasma membrane (Resille GFP) to position the bead at the plasma membrane. Our methodology does not impair morphogenesis and repeated force application can be performed without cellular damage.<br/> <br/>It is well established that tissue mechanics is an essential component to consider for the control of cellular behavior (differentiation, cell division, migrationâ¦) leading to morphogenesis during animal development and to the progression of diseases such as tumor formation and cancer progression (Lecuit <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Heisenberg and Bellaiche, 2013; Engler <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Frey <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Godard and Heisenberg, 2019; Northcott <em>et al.</em>, 2018). In these contexts, our method can be used to probe tissue mechanics and its changes or to apply local forces to investigate mechanosensation and mechanotransduction.</p>

The electromagnet is composed of three components: A Mu-metal rod (soft ferromagnetic alloy with very high magnetic permeability), a radiator in aluminium to evacuate the heat and a copper wire to connect to electric current (Figures 1A and 1B). The Mu-metal rod is sharpened to achieve a conical tip and then thermally annealed. (both operations can be done at the Sekels factory). A custom manufactured 45 mm long aluminium cylinderâwith 4.5 mm inner diameter to host the Mu-metal rod was used to dissipate the heat generated by the magnet. The outer diameter of the cylinder was 200 mm. Close to one end, four, 1 mm wide and 40 mm deep troughs spaced by 2 mm were milled into the cylinder to increase the radiator surface. Another 220 mm wide trough of 100 mm diameter was milled 5 mm from the other end of the cylinder to host 100 coils of the copper wire. On the two extremities, three plastic screw were positioned at 120Â° interval and were used to hold the Mu-metal rod (Figures 1C and 1D).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427000514_9728.jpg" width="158"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Electromagnet set up for force application.</strong> A. Photograph of the power supply (left) and electromagnet mounted on the micromanipulator. B. Photograph of the electromagnet mounted on the stage of the spinning disk microscope. C. Close up of the electromagnet, the left arrow indicates the Mu-metal rod conically shaped, the center arrow indicates the copper coil around the radiator and the right arrow indicates the aluminium radiator. D. Schematics showing the design of the aluminium radiator, a = 160 mm, b = 120 mm, c = 220 mm, d = 160 mm, e = 200 mm.<br/><br/>Upon application of a direct current circulating within the cupper coils, a magnetic field emanates from the tip and decays spatially. Magnetic beads lying within the magnetic field are attracted towards the tip with a force proportional to the gradient of the field (Kollmannsberger and Fabry, 2007).<br/>  To calibrate the force exerted on the bead as a function of the distance from the magnet, we developed an assay using beads embedded in PDMS. Since its viscosity is known, by measuring the velocity of the beads within the PDMS when the magnetic field is applied, we can calculate the force field as a function of the distance from the tip: Stokeâs law directly relates the force to the velocity (Figure 2 and Video 1).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427000547_0413.jpg" width="199"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

After injection, the coverslip supporting the embryos is left to develop over a neodymium magnet that will hold the bead in the embryo cortex. Thus, at cellularization time, the bead will be naturally encapsulated into a newly formed cell. By choosing the orientation of the embryo relative to the neodymium magnet, it is possible to embed the particle in a specific group of cells, which will later develop into specific tissues or organs.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427000626_9707.jpg" width="126"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.
