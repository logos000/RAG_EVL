            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cardiac, neuronal and renal tubular epithelial cells are the most metabolically active cells in the body. Their fate depends largely on their mitochondria as the primary energy generating system which participates in the control of apoptosis, cell cycle and metabolism. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of many chronic diseases including diabetic nephropathy. A drop in mitochondrial bioenergetics efficiency is often associated with altered expression of respiratory chain complexes. Moreover, recent studies demonstrate that cellular proteins can shuttle to mitochondria and modify their function directly. Here we illustrate two mitochondria isolation protocols; one is recommended if the purity of the mitochondrial fraction is a priority such as if the mitochondrial localization of a protein has to be validated, the other if a high yield of intact functional mitochondria is required for functional studies and quantitative Western blotting. Next, we provide a detailed protocol for Western blotting of isolated mitochondria and renal cortex either to prove the purity of isolated fractions or to quantify complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. We used this approach to identify classically cell membrane bound angiotensin II receptors in mitochondria and to study the effect of these receptors on mitochondrial function in early stages of diabetic nephropathy.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Mitochondria are the primary energy generating system in metabolically active cells with a high energy demand such as renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC), cardiac muscle and neuronal cells. Additionally, they participate in the regulation of calcium signaling, proliferation, cell death and metabolism (Antico Arciuch <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Thus, it is not surprising that diabetic nephropathy (DN) correlates more closely to defective mitochondria and increased oxidative stress in the kidney than to hyperglycemia. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by defective mitochondria may initiate a vicious cycle, aggravating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Arora and Singn, 2014; Higgins and Coughlan, 2014). Mitochondrial ATP is produced in the respiratory chain (ETC), an assembly of more than 20 discrete electron carriers that are mainly grouped into five multi-polypeptide complexes and localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Increased oxygen consumption for ATP production may contribute to ischemia. Increased ROS may alter a number of functional cellular processes. A major regulator of DN is angiotensin II (AngII) which primarily acts via its type 1 receptor (AT1R). A second AngII receptor type 2 (AT2R) often counteracts the AT1R mediated effects (Peters <em>et al.</em>, 2012). We have previously shown that mitochondrial dysfunction already occurred in the very early stages of DN and was associated with an altered expression of the ETC complexes. Further we demonstrated that the AT2R, classically located at the cell membrane as a G-protein coupled receptor, can translocate to the mitochondria and protect against the diabetes induced drop in mitochondrial bioenergetics efficiency, the rise in mitochondrial superoxide production, metabolic reprogramming and increased PTEC proliferation. These effects were associated with altered expression of ETC complexes (Micakovic <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Such translocation of cellular proteins to the mitochondria was recently reported for a number of proteins including renin (Peters <em>et al.</em>, 1996; Wanka <em>et al.</em>, 2009), ACE2 (Wilson <em>et al.</em>, 2016), vitamin D receptor (Silvagno <em>et al.</em>, 2013) and polycystin 1 (Lin <em>et al.</em>, 2018). In order to prove their presence in mitochondria and to dissect their mitochondrial function from indirect effects, studies on isolated mitochondria are required. Isolation of intact, functional and pure mitochondria is crucial for <em>in vitro </em>approaches. Furthermore, we performed Western blotting to quantify the ETC complexes and to evaluate the mitochondrial fraction for possible contaminations with other cellular components like the endoplasmatic reticulum, cytosol and cell membrane. Mitochondrial isolation procedures still vary among research groups and inconsistent or contradictory results often found in the literature may be due to differences in the quality of mitochondria as a result of different isolation procedures (Gross <em>et al.</em>, 2011). <br/><br/>In this paper, we illustrate two protocols with highly reproducible outcomes for the isolation of pure and structurally intact mitochondria from kidney cortex of experimental rats: 1. isolation using the Qproteome<sup>TM</sup> Mitochondria Isolation Kit and 2. isolation using the serial differential centrifugation method. Isolation of mitochondria using Qproteome<sup>TM</sup> Mitochondria Isolation Kit provides highly pure mitochondrial fraction, free of contamination by other cellular compartments. The main limitation of this method is that it uses only 60 mg of tissue and therefore results in a low mitochondrial yield and is very expensive. This method is performed according to the manufacturerâs protocol, with slight changes. During the isolation procedure, different subcellular fractions can be collected (cytosol, nuclei/cell debris, mitochondria, and plasma membrane/endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). This isolation method is recommended if the purity of the mitochondrial fraction is a priority, such as if the mitochondrial localization of a protein has to be validated or composition of the mitochondrial proteome has to be determined by mass spectroscopy (Figure 1A). Isolation of mitochondria using the differential centrifugation method provides a much higher yield of functionally active mitochondria. The mitochondrial fraction obtained has a slight reduction in purity compared to the Qproteome<sup>TM</sup> Mitochondria Isolation Kit, but still has very low levels of contamination (&gt; 90% of purity). This isolation method can be used for mitochondrial functional studies which require a large quantity of structurally intact mitochondria. The homogenization procedure is a crucial step that can significantly impact the quality of resulting mitochondria. However, the isolation methods that result in high fractional yield typically require harsh homogenization that often damages the organelles. In contrast to other published mitochondria isolation protocols which harvested the 3,000-10,000 <em>x g</em> fraction (Graham, 2001), we used a very gentle homogenization in Dounce glass homogenizer with a manually driven glass pestle. We then harvested the 500-1,000 g fraction rich in pure mitochondria with preserved integrity after differential centrifugation at 100, 300, 500 and 1,000 <em>x g</em> (Peters <em>et al.</em>, 1996). This approach minimizes both mitochondria damage and contamination with the microsomes/plasma membranes and nuclei (Figure 1B).<br/><br/>For validation of purity and structural integrity of isolated mitochondria, we describe a detailed protocol for Western blot performed on subcellular fractions or proteins isolated from the whole kidney cortex. To demonstrate the purity of the isolated mitochondrial fraction we used antibodies targeting a specific organelle marker: the presence of endoplasmic reticulum is detected by Anti-GRP78; cytosol by Anti-GAPDH; and nucleus by Anti-Histone H3. The presence of the endoplasmic reticulum is also detected by using Anti-KDEL monoclonal antibody. Anti-COX IV antibody is used as an effective loading control for mitochondria (Figures 1A and 1B). COX IV is polypeptide chains of cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal oxidase in mitochondrial electron transport, and it is generally expressed at a consistently high level. Mitochondrial integrity is an important consideration when assessing the function of isolated mitochondria since damaged mitochondrial membranes can become rate limiting factor for oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis. We detected representative subunits of each electron transport chain complex (ETC) (CI:NDUFB8, CII:SDHB, CIII:UQCRC2, CIV:MTC01, CV:ATPVA) in mitochondrial fraction using an OXPHOS cocktail of monoclonal antibodies. Anti VDAC-1/Porin monoclonal antibody is used to detect the mitochondrial outer membrane.</p>
