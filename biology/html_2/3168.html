            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Upon entry into a host cell, the HIV-1 virus undergoes a series of critical early replication events including reverse transcription, nuclear import, and integration of its cDNA into the host genome. Molecular assays used to detect and analyze changes in HIV-1 early phase replication events are valuable tools in developing potential antiretroviral drugs, as well as studying the pathogenesis of HIV. Described here are the molecular assays utilized to detect and quantify HIV-1 early, intermediate, and late reverse transcription (RT) products. In addition to this, protocols for quantifying HIV-1 2-LTR circle DNA and proviral DNA after integration are also included. In these protocols, the optimized TaqMan Real-time PCR reagent is used to increase assay sensitivity and reproducibility. Furthermore, a nested PCR is applied to HIV-1 integration quantification with increased accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>After binding to the receptor and fusing to the host cellâs lipid bilayers, the HIV-1 nucleoprotein complex first enters the cytoplasm, crosses the nuclear envelope, and finally integrates the reverse-transcribed HIV genome into that of the host cell. During this early phase of replication, HIV-1 converts its single-stranded RNA genome into linear double-stranded DNA in cytoplasm by an intricate reverse transcription process (Hu and Hughes, 2012). After nuclear import, some of these linear viral genomes are integrated into the host chromatin. These are termed proviruses. The remaining cDNA that fails to integrate is circularized into either 1-LTR circle DNA or 2-LTR circle DNAs (Sloan and Wainberg, 2011). HIV-1 can counteract various host restriction factors that can interfere with its early phase replication events (Zheng <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Molecular assays used to detect and analyze changes in HIV-1 early phase replication events are valuable tools in studying HIV pathogenesis and in developing potential antiretroviral drugs. We report here methods to quantitatively analyze several critical events during HIV-1 early phase replication by using Real-time PCR. The early, intermediate and late stages of reverse transcription events are represented by the initiation of HIV-1 minus strand DNA synthesis, the elongation of minus-strand DNA synthesis following transfer of minus strand DNA, and the synthesis of complete double-stranded linear viral DNA after plus-strand DNA transfer respectively. Given that 2-LTR circles are exclusively found in the cell nucleus, they have become a useful marker of viral nuclear import (Sloan and Wainberg, 2011). As shown in Figure 1, a nested PCR is utilized to quantify HIV-1 integration with increased sensitivity and specificity. Since <em>Alu</em> sequences are the most abundant repetitive DNA, containing over one million copies dispersed throughout the human genome, the 1<sup>st</sup> round of PCR is designed to amplify a fragment between the integrated HIV-1 <em>gag</em> gene and the host genomic <em>Alu</em> sequence element. Both forward and reverse <em>Alu</em> PCR primers are used in 1<sup>st</sup> round <em>Alu-gag</em> PCR, since either orientation of <em>Alu</em> sequence can exist in human genome. To avoid the amplification of unintegrated HIV-1 cDNA, the 5â end of 1<sup>st</sup> PCR gag R primer is tagged with a unique R sequence. Only the 1<sup>st</sup> round PCR amplicons containing the R sequence can be used as templates in the 2<sup>nd</sup> round of Real-time PCR. The optimized TaqMan Real-time PCR reagent is used to increase assay sensitivity and reproducibility. All PCR primers, probe sequences, and their amplicon locations are listed in Table 1.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="149" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190215/20190215004224_1378.jpg" width="180"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.
