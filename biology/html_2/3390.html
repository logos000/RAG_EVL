            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Factors implicated in the pathophysiology of intestinal inflammation include defects in intestinal epithelial barrier function, abnormal immune responses, and activities of the gut microbiota. Current agents used to treat human Inflammatory Bowels Disease (IBD), chronic inflammation of digestive tract, have serious side effects. In addition, most of these treatments target the damaging factors while not providing pro-healing factors that repair the damaged intestine. Here we provide a method to isolate, purify and characterize a specific population from ginger (ginger-derived nanoparticles: GDNPs 2) with anti-inflammatory activities. GDNPs 2 as a drug vehicle are a novel natural, nontoxic delivery system, which target the inflamed intestinal mucosa, blocks damaging factors while promoting pro-healing factors and could easily be developed for large-scale production aimed at the treatment of IBD.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Efforts to develop new drug-based therapeutic approaches against Intestinal Bowel Disease (IBD) must overcome several challenges, including issues of delivery, potential off-target effects, safety, toxicity, large-scale production costs, and tissue specificity (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2017). We and other groups have recently demonstrated that artificially synthesized nanoparticles may be used to target low doses of drugs (<em>e.g.</em>, siRNAs, proteins and peptides) to specific cell types or tissues (Xiao <em>et al.</em>, 2017). However, the nanoparticles synthesized to date have two major limitations: i) each constituent of the synthesized nanoparticles must be examined for potential <em>in vivo</em> toxicity before clinical application; and ii) the production scale is limited. The use of nanoparticles derived from natural sources may overcome these limitations of synthetic nanoparticles. Here, we provide a safe and cost-effective sucrose gradient ultracentrifuge method to isolate, purify and characterize a specific population of nanoparticles from ginger (ginger-derived nanoparticles: GDNPs 2) with anti-inflammatory activities. GDNPs 2 enable encapsulation of various types of therapeutic agents such as DNA, RNA and antibodies. Loading therapeutic agents in ginger-derived nanolipids can be found in a separate publication (Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2017). GDNPs 2 represents a novel natural, nontoxic delivery system that targets the inflamed intestinal mucosa, blocks damaging factors while promoting healing factors and may easily be developed for large-scale production aimed at the treatment of IBD.</p>

The assay is based on the reaction of protein with an alkaline copper tartrate solution and Folin reagent (DC Protein Assay Instruction Manual). Proteins effect a reduction of the Folin reagent by loss of 1, 2, or 3 oxygen atoms, thereby producing one or more of several possible reduced species which have a characteristic blue color with maximum absorbance at 750 nm. Color development is primarily due to the amino acid tyrosine and tryptophan groups.</em> </li><li>For short term storage (less than 3 months), GDNPs can be suspended in PBS and stored at -80 Â°C.

Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) was used to measure size distribution and zeta potential of the GDNPs. The average nanoparticle size of band 2 was approximately ~115.8 nm in radius (Figure 3). An approximate zeta potential value was ~12 mV at pH 6 for band 2 (Figure 4). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis also confirmed successful isolation and characterization of stable GDNPs (Figures 5 and 6). <em>In vitro</em> stability test for GDNPs 2 confirmed the tolerance of the nanoparticle within harsh environment such as gastric and intestinal tract. Precisely measured particle size and zeta potential of GDNPs 2 ensure the capability to be used as stable drug carrier in human system. Also, TEM and AFM probed ability of GDNPs 2âs electromechanical functionality which is critical for characterization for biological materials. <br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="102" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190925/20190925232940_0277.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.
