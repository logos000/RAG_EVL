            <h1>Acute Cerebellar Slice Preparation Using a Tissue Chopper</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Yubin Wang, Michel Baudry</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Acute cerebellar slices are widely used among neuroscientists to study the properties of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission as well as intracellular signaling pathways involved in their regulation in cerebellum. The cerebellar cortex presents a well-organized circuitry, and several neuronal pathways can be stimulated and recorded reliably in acute cerebellar slices. A widely used acute cerebellar slice preparation technique was adapted from Edwardsâ thin slice preparation method published in 1989 (Edwards <em>et al.</em>, 1989). Most of the acute cerebellar slice preparation techniques use a vibrating microtome for slicing freshly dissected cerebellum from various animal species. Here we introduce a simpler method, which uses a tissue chopper to quickly prepare acute sagittal cerebellar slices from rodents. Cerebellum is dissected from the whole brain and sliced with a tissue chopper into 200-400 Âµm thick slices. Slices are allowed to recover in oxygenated aCSF at 37 Â°C for 1-2 h. Slices can then be used for electrophysiology or other types of experimentation. This method can be used to prepare cerebellar slices from mouse or rat aged from postnatal day 7 to 2 years. The preparation is faster and easier than other methods and provides a more versatile diversity of applications.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Acute cerebellar slice preparations, like many other current brain slice preparation techniques, originated from Edwardsâ thin slice preparation method published in 1989 (Edwards <em>et al.</em>, 1989). In general, cerebellum was quickly dissected and immersed in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free aCSF and glued to the stage of a vibratome. After slicing, slices were recovered in regular aCSF for 1-2 h before use (Llano <em>et al.</em>, 1991a and 1991b; Kano and Konnerth, 1992). Here we introduce a method adapted from the acute hippocampal slice preparation method used in our laboratory. Freshly dissected cerebellum is rapidly sliced (around 10 s) on a McIlwain tissue chopper without the need for glue or oxygenation during slicing. The slices prepared using this method are as healthy as the ones prepared with a vibratome and can be used for electrophysiology or a variety of other manipulations. </p>

This stimulation elicited a typical P1-N1-P2-N2 waveform (Barnes <em>et al.</em>, 2011), where N1 corresponds to the presynaptic fiber volley and N2 to the postsynaptic population spike (Figure 4). Responses elicited by stimulation intensity below 120 mA were too unreliable to be analyzed, and only responses elicited by stimulation intensities above 120 mA were analyzed by calculating the ratio of N2 over N1, which reflects the efficiency of synaptic transmission. At all intensities, the N2/N1 ratio was smaller in calpain-1 KO mice as compared with WT mice, and the overall difference between the two genotypes was statistically significant (Figure 4). The N2/N1 ratios of the EPSPs recorded in cerebellar slices from calpain-1, and PHLPP1 double-KO (DKO) mice at all stimulation intensities were intermediate between those in WT and calpain-1 KO mice, indicating that synaptic transmission was at least partially restored in the cerebellum of DKO mice (Figure 4).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190301/20190301180614_3100.jpg" width="208"/><br/><strong>Figure 4. Parallel fibers to Purkinje cell EPSPs are reduced in adult calpain-1 KO mice, and partially restored in adult calpain-1 and PHLPP1 double-KO (DKO) mice.</strong> Acute cerebellar slices were prepared as described in Procedure, and field EPSPs were evoked by parallel fiber stimulation recorded in the Purkinje cell layer.
