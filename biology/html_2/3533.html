            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p> In the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in rodents, systemic injections of pilocarpine induce continuous, prolonged limbic seizures, a condition termed âStatus Epilepticusâ (SE). With appropriate doses, many inbred strains of mice show behavioral seizures within an hour after pilocarpine is injected. With the behavioral scoring system based on a modification of the original Racine scale, one can monitor the seizures behaviorally, as they develop into more prolonged seizures and SE. SE is typically associated with damage to subsets of hippocampal neurons and other structural changes in the hippocampus and generally subsides on its own. However, more precise control of the duration of SE is commonly achieved by injecting a benzodiazepine into the mouse 1 to 3 h after the onset of SE to suppress the seizures. Several days following pilocarpine-induced SE, electrographic and behavioral seizures begin to occur spontaneously. The goal of this protocol is to reliably generate mice that develop spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and show the typical neuropathological changes in the brain characteristic of severe human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), without high mortality. To reduce mortality, multiple subthreshold injections of pilocarpine are administered, which increases the percentage of mice developing SE without concomitant mortality. Precise control of the duration of SE (1 or 3 h) is achieved by suppressing SE with the benzodiazepine Midazolam (Versed). We have found that this protocol is an efficient means for generating mice that subsequently develop characteristics of human mTLE including high-frequency interictal spike and wave activity and SRS. In addition, we and others have shown that this protocol produces mice that show excitotoxic cell death of subsets of hippocampal GABAergic interneurons, particularly in the dentate gyrus and compensatory sprouting of excitatory projections from dentate granule cells (mossy fiber sprouting). Aspects of this protocol have been described in several of our previous publications.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The mouse pilocarpine model of TLE is an experimental paradigm that has been widely used as an animal model of human mTLE. This model has been used for testing long-term efficacy of novel therapies for suppressing SRS and improving cognitive and neuropathological changes associated with severe mTLE. This rodent model of TLE recapitulates many of the neuropathological hallmarks in mTLE, including severe seizures, loss of GABAergic interneurons in the dentate gyrus, Ammonâs Horn sclerosis, and cognitive impairments (Swartz <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Although some patients with mTLE can be treated successfully anti-convulsant medications, about one-third experience intractable pharmaco-resistant seizures and surgical removal of the seizure foci are required. If the foci are located in the mesial temporal lobes, surgical removal may not be feasible due to the role of the hippocampus in memory formation and consolidation. For these patient populations, novel treatments are needed. The cost-effective pilocarpine model of TLE in rodents provides an experimental system for testing novel therapies because a high percentage of rodents develop SRS that can be monitored by video electroencephalography (v-EEG) for weeks or months. Novel treatments that suppress seizures can also be studied for their effects on the neuropathological changes observed in this model, including mossy fiber sprouting (Henderson <em>et al.</em>, 2014), dispersion of the granule cell layer (Scharfman <em>et al.</em>, 2000), and aberrant neurogenesis (Parent <em>et al.</em>, 1997).<br/><br/>Pilocarpine hydrochloride (referred to as pilocarpine) is a drug that directly stimulates muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the central nervous system and in the parasympathetic branch of the peripheral nervous system. As a parasympathomimetic drug, pilocarpine induces exocrine gland secretion and stimulates smooth muscle contractions in the gut and secretory glands. It is also a chemoconvulsant that is used to elicit limbic seizures in rodents. Pilocarpine is typically administered by subcutaneous (Walter <em>et al.</em>, 2007) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections in rodents to induce a condition of continuous generalized seizures, called Status Epilepticus (SE). After the mice develop SE in this model, the experimenter terminates the seizures by injecting a sedative dose of benzodiazepine, a class of drugs that acts on gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A) receptors in the brain. Typically, rodents that have experienced one or more hours of SE, will develop TLE with high-frequency interictal spike, wave activity, and SRS (Mello <em>et al.</em>, 1993; Wozny <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Knopp <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Henderson <em>et al.</em>, 2014).<br/><br/>In a comprehensive study of the multiple factors contributing to the development of SRS in the rodent pilocarpine model, the strongest correlations were found between dentate gyrus GABAergic neuron loss and seizure frequency (<em>i.e.</em>, disease severity) (Buckmaster <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Many human TLE patients and rodents subjected to pilocarpine-induce SE show loss of somatostatin-expressing GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus (Robbins <em>et al.</em>, 1991; Borges <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Hoffman <em>et al.</em>, 2016). In the mouse pilocarpine model, GABAergic interneurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and CA1 that co-express somatostatin and Striatal Enriched Tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP) were found to be highly vulnerable to SE (Buckmaster and Jongen-Relo, 1999; Choi <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Associated with the loss of GABAergic interneurons, studies reported reduced synaptic inhibition (Kobayashi and Buckmaster, 2003), despite the fact that many of the GABAergic interneurons in the dentate gyrus and CA1 that survive after SE sprout additional inhibitory projections (Wittner <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Bausch, 2005; Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Thind <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Loss of both somatic and distal dendritic GABAergic inhibition to granule cells occurs shortly after SE, but precedes the development of SRS, suggesting that loss of GABAergic inhibition onto granule cells in the dentate gyrus is an important predictor of whether TLE will develop (Kobayashi and Buckmaster, 2003).<br/><br/>Because of the strong link between loss of GABAergic inhibition and development of TLE, we and other groups have tested whether transplantation of GABAergic progenitors, from either the embryonic mouse forebrain or generated in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells, suppresses pilocarpine-induced TLE (Maisano <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Henderson <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Anderson <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Additionally, recent work shows that this model can be used in combination with molecular and electrophysiological approaches, such as retroviral labeling and optogenetics, to evaluate cellular mechanisms responsible for seizure suppression following transplantation (Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The methods detailed in this protocol for induction of SE in both male and female rodents can be adapted to different inbred strains of mice with low mortality; a high incidence of the mice that experience SE will subsequently develop SRS and the typical histopathological hallmarks of TLE (Walter <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Henderson <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Anderson <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>In the following protocol, we provide the detailed methods for the successful induction of SE with multiple subthreshold doses of pilocarpine in inbred strains of mice. This method builds upon number of prior studies. In a comparison of 8 inbred strains of mice, Schauwecker and colleagues found significant differences in the susceptibility to pilocarpine, mortality and neuropathological changes after SE (Schauwecker, 2012). Doses ranging between 300 and 400 mg/kg were reported to induce SE successfully. Higher single doses of pilocarpine were correlated with more successful induction of SE but also increased mortality (Turski <em>et al.</em>, 1984; Cavalheiro <em>et al.</em>, 1991; Curia <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Buckmaster and Haney, 2012; Kelly and Coulter, 2017). In contrast, multiple subthreshold doses of pilocarpine were effective for inducing SE and SRS, with much lower mortality rates (Glien <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Groticke <em>et al.</em>, 2007).</p>

The optimal dose of pilocarpine is critical for successful SE induction in mice and should be worked out based on the strain used in the study.<br/>  To induce SE in mice, first inject scopolamine (0.5 mg/ml, i.p.), followed by an injection of pilocarpine (280 mg/kg; i.p.). If the mouse fails to develop seizure in 30 min after the first injection, 1 or 2 supplemental doses of pilocarpine 30-60 mg/kg, i.p. can be administered to induce SE. Mice injected with pilocarpine at these doses will generally develop generalized motor seizures that may include jumping and running. During induction of SE, the experimenter monitors behavioral seizures visually, based on a modification of a behavioral scoring system originally developed by Racine (Racine, 1972). In the modified version, the severity of behavioral seizures are scored (Shibley and Smith, 2002) (see Table 1). Mice that develop SE exhibit repetitive head bobbing and a lack of motor control that continues after the seizures are attenuated with Midazolam. The rhythmic head movements typically subside after ~6 h but body tics or brief limb/body twitches may continue.<br/><br/><strong>Table 1. Modified Racine scale for scoring seizures</strong><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200217/20200217015543_4177.jpg" width="560"/><br/><br/>Monitoring and scoring pilocarpine-induced seizures and SE: The modified Racine Scale shown in Table 1 is used during pilocarpine induction of SE to observe and classify different levels of seizures (Shibley and Smith, 2002). The original scale included 5 behavior categories of seizures. In the pilocarpine model in mice, several stages may occur together in rapid succession, making it difficult to distinguish stage 4. This rating system is convenient, but less sensitive than EEG detection of seizures. The following video recordings illustrate three stages of seizures, stage 3 (Video 1), stage 5 (Video 2), and SE (Video 3).<br/><br/><!--video3533-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3533-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3533-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3533/3533-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.

Although the onset of SRS varies, we find it useful to begin to monitor 3 weeks after SE induction because the mice begin to exhibit more frequent seizures by 3-4 weeks. The effects of a particular experimental treatment on seizures can be accurately monitored using video (V)-EEG recordings (Curia <em>et al.</em>, 2008). We typically conduct continuous v-EEG recordings for 3 weeks or longer, when assessing the efficacy of a particular therapeutic treatment.<br/><br/>When performing multiple stereotaxic surgeries, we typically wait at least 1 week after SE. In our prior work, we made stereotaxic injections of stem cells at ~2 weeks after SE and stereotaxic injections of retrovirus at 1 week before, or after, stem cell transplantation. We typically have an experimental treatment group (<em>e.g.</em>, mice that receive stem cell transplants) and compare them to a control group that receives vehicle (or stereotaxic injections of the media minus stem cells). We then implant subdural electrodes for chronic v-EEG recordings at ~3 weeks after SE. To detect and quantify SRS, it is useful to carry out continuous v-EEG recordings for 3 weeks or longer. For v-EEG recordings, EEG signals are amplified with a preamplifier connected to the data acquisition device and recorded with Sirenia Seizure Pro software (Pinnacle Technology), an analysis package for quickly identifying and analyzing user-defined seizure events based on power and line length. Data are captured using Sirenia Acquisition software at 1,000 Hz with a gain of 10x, using high and low pass-filters set at 0.5 Hz and 100 Hz respectively. Video recordings are synchronized with EEG signals by the Sirenia seizure monitoring software. We use changes in power and line length deviations from baseline EEG brain activity to detect seizures in this software (Henderson <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Anderson <em>et al.</em>, 2018). After detecting potential seizures with the software, each of the seizure events should be verified manually by an experimenter who views the EEG and associated video recording and scores the severity of the seizures based on the modified Racine scale (Table 1; Figure 2). Verification is necessary to distinguish true seizures from occasional EEG artifacts caused by grooming or other issues with the head-mounted electrodes.<br/><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Open âSirenia Seizureâ. Click âFileâ, then select the file to analyze.</li><li>Click âTime Spanâ and choose â1 Minuteâ.

Change the top box to â500â and the bottom box to â-500â to scale down the EEG trace for easier viewing of seizure activity. Seizure activity is usually about Â± 500 Î¼V or more than twice baseline amplitude, for each mouse.</li><li>Click the âSeizure Settingsâ icon.
