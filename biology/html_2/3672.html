            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are formed mainly by bacteria fermenting undigested carbohydrates in the colon, they are based on the number of carbon atoms in the carbon chain. Organic fatty acids with less than 6 carbon atoms are called short-chain fatty acids. SCFAs are closely related to various aspects of the human body, so more and more researchers concentrate on SCFAs. This protocol describes, a direct injection gas chromatography detection method with a pretreatment method for extracting SCFA from mice feces by combining acidification. The corresponding sample limit of quantization (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) are 0.8-1.0 mg/L and 0.5-0.8 mg/L, respectively. The correlation coefficient of calibration curve is greater than 0.999. The recovery rate of the spiked standard is 80%-102%. This method can be used to analyze and determine SCFAs in mice feces. Therefore, this is an economical, effective and reproducible method for SCFAs measurement in mice samples.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are important molecules that regulate and control biological functions (Siri-Tarino <em> et al.</em>, 2015). SCFAs typically refer to volatile organic fatty acids with less than six carbon atoms (Wong <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Marette and Jobin, 2015). They mainly include acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid. SCFAs are mainly produced by the intestinal microbiota, which ferments undigested carbohydrates and dietary fiber in the colon. (Henningsson <em>et al.</em>, 2001). Many studies have shown that branched fatty acids are derived from branched-chain amino acids and leucine (Koh <em>et al.</em>, 2016). A small amount of branched-chain fatty acids are generated by fermenting undigested proteins (Cummings and Englyst, 1987), such as isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid. Numerous types of SCFAs are present in the colon, and have different functions, because bacteria are complex and fermentation substrates vary in the colon (Topping and Clifton, 2001). These metabolites are formed and absorbed in the colon and then transported through the hepatic vein to the liver. Only approximately 5% of SCFAs are excreted in feces and the remaining are absorbed by colon cells (Ruppin <em>et al.</em>, 1980; Hu<em> et al.</em>, 2010; Stumpff, 2018). SCFAs play an important role in maintaining the normal function of the large intestine and the morphology and function of colonic epithelial cells. Among other features, SCFAs contributes to the main role of the intestinal flora in the homeostasis of the host. Studies have shown that propionic acid, butyric acid and 3-hydroxybutyric acid, which are signaling molecules, play important roles in activating G protein-coupled receptors and inhibiting histone deacetylase activity (Johnstone, 2002; Xiong <em>et al.</em>, 2004). The most abundant molecules in SCFAs are acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid, which are usually present in deprotonated form. SCFAs are quickly absorbed by the hindgut and store energy. Acetic acid provides 10% of the bodyâs energy expenditure and is an important component of the collective energy source (Hu <em>et al.</em>, 2010). The close relationship between SCFAs content in the human body and human health has always been the focus of research (O'Keefe, 2016). Therefore, a method for the rapid qualitative and quantitative analyses of SCFAs in complex biological matrices is needed to be developed (Fiorini <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/><br/> Many detection techniques can be used for the qualitative and quantitative identification of SCFAs. Those include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Torii <em>et al.</em>, 2010; de SÃ¡ <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Schiffels <em>et al.</em>, 2011; De Baere <em>et al.</em>, 2013), capillary electrophoresis (Saavedra<em> et al.</em>, 2000), and ion exchange HILC (Horspool<em> et al.</em>, 1991). However, these methods have several limitations in terms of poor sensitivity and low recovery (Saavedra <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Destandau <em>et al</em>., 2005; Horspool <em>et al.</em>, 1991). Gas chromatography (GC) is the most commonly used method for SCFA analysis because SCFAs are volatile. SCFA biological samples are prepared differently in terms of sample processing such as pretreatment, distillation, ultrafiltration, and extraction (Zhao<em> et al.</em>, 2006; Fiorini <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Hoving <em>et al.</em>, 2018). However, the tedious and time-consuming pretreatment process may be one of the reasons for the decrease in detection sensitivity and recovery of SCFA.<br/><br/> Therefore, GC was chosen to detect SCFA, but a pretreatment method for processing biological samples needs to be developed. Such method must not only be simple and easy to implement, but also time-efficient. In this study, a simple and effective pretreatment method for the rapid qualitative and quantitative determination of SCFAs in mice feces via GC was developed. This approach can provide a basis for the analysis of SCFAs in other biological samples.<br/></p>

At this time, all organs of the mice were mature and the health index was good. In the following 1-2 months of the experimental cycle, the mice were healthy status.</li><li>In the sample collection step, after weighing the feces of mice, avoid the repeated freeze-thaw of samples. There are two benefits to storing at -20 Â°C. One is to freeze the sample into clumps for easy weighing, and the other is to reduce the volatilization of the material in the feces.</li><li>There are many ways to collect mice feces. This article chooses a method to deal with stimulus. The operation is as follows: fix the mouse and lift its tail, then press the mouse's lower abdomen with your fingers, collect fresh feces in a micro-centrifuge tube, store at -20 Â°C.</li><li>The number of samples is not a rigid requirement. It should be judged according to the specific experimental conditions. The purpose of selecting 12 in this article is to increase the randomness of the sample selection as much as possible to make the experimental results more accurate. If there is a clear experimental group sample, the sample size is the experimental group sample number. With regard to the amount of mice feces, it is necessary to judge at least 100 mg for one test. If the recovery rate of six kinds of SCFAs is tested, and one SCFA is added with three different concentrations of SCFA standard solution, it will need to be tested 18 times. When the final detection of SCFAs in the sample, ensure the accuracy, test 3 times, take the average value, and include blank Group, such a system operation will need to be tested 22 times, conservatively requires 2,200 mg. In calculating the loss during weighing and other experiments, at least 3,000 mg is collected.</li><li>When using 1 M HCI, configure the new reagent according to the recipes. Do not use reagents configured long ago.</li><li>When using a vortex mixer to mix HCl with the sample, the centrifuge tube should be tightly covered to prevent the mixture from flying out.</li><li>The reason for apparent lumping is that during pretreatment, the sample is frozen, and there may be caking. Another possibility is that the fecal sample itself has caking, which needs to be shaken to separate the caking and fully reflect with HCl.</li><li>During ultrasonic treatment in the ice water bath, add ice in time to maintain the temperature.</li><li>The purpose of using the pipette gun is to operate easily and sensitively, and to control the suction at any time.</li><li>During the extraction operation, the centrifuge tube needs to be inverted up and down several times to fully react the supernatant with ethyl acetate. The step lasts 3 min.</li><li>Pay attention to the liquid level dividing line, and do not over aspirate. The disposable syringe is not sensitive enough for operation, so special attention should be paid to it. Alternatively, use a pipette tip to transfer the supernatant to another tube and then filter to avoid disturbing the sediment or the bottom layer.</li><li>When using 0.22 Î¼m organic filter membrane to filter the supernatant, it is necessary to control the pressure of the needle tube to prevent the filter membrane from being broken.</li><li>When configuring a single standard solution or a mixed standard solution, try to configure a large-capacity solution or a high-concentration solution as much as possible to reduce the concentration error in the solution preparation.</li><li>When performing a gradient dilution operation, select the appropriate volumetric flask for constant volume.</li><li>According to the content of SCFAs in mice feces, the setting range of SCFAs concentration in single standard solution or mixed standard solution was determined. </li><li>The purpose of analyzing a single standard solution is to determine the species of each substance in the mixed standard solution.</li><li>Because the GC injection volume is very small, when performing gradient dilution, you can choose a small volume volumetric flask to make the volume, the purpose is to reduce the waste of solution.</li><li>When analyzing a single standard solution, you can choose the order from low concentration to high concentration, we only need to obtain the peak time.</li><li>The retention time and the detection range of each analyte may vary according to capillary column type and length and equipment brands.</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti36254">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>1 M HCl solution (100 ml)</li>  8.35 ml HCl 37% (v/v) into a 100 ml volumetric flask<br/>  Add distilled water to constant volume to scale<br/><li>SCFAs single standard solution (100 ml)</li>  The highest concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid are 2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.5, 0.5, and 0.1 g/L. <br/>  (The label is NO.1)<br/>  190.48 Âµl analytical standard acetic acid, GC assay â¥ 99.8%<br/>  50.51 Âµl analytical standard propionic acid, GC assay â¥ 99.8%<br/>  10.53 Âµl analytical standard isobutyric acid, GC assay â¥ 99.8%<br/>  52.08 Âµl analytical standard butyric acid, GC assay â¥ 99.8%<br/>  53.72 Âµl analytical standard isovaleric acid, GC assay â¥ 99.8%<br/>  10.65 Âµl analytical standard valeric acid, GC assay â¥ 99.8%<br/>  Add ethyl acetate to 100 ml volumetric flask respectively for constant volume.
