            <h1>Differential Fractionation of Erythrocytes Infected by <em>Plasmodium berghei</em></h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The study of host/pathogen interactions at the cellular level during <em>Plasmodium</em> intra-erythrocytic cycle requires differential extraction techniques aiming to analyze the different compartments of the infected cell. Various protocols have been proposed in the literature to study specific compartments and/or membranes in the infected erythrocyte. The task remains delicate despite the use of enzymes or detergents theoretically capable of degrading specific membranes inside the infected cell.<br/><br/>The remit of this protocol is to propose a method to isolate the erythrocyte cytosol and ghosts from the other compartments of the infected cell via a percoll gradient. Also, the lysis of the erythrocyte membrane is done using equinatoxin II, which has proven to be more effective at erythrocyte lysis regardless of the cell infection status, compared to the commonly used streptolysin. The parasitophorous vacuole (PV) content is collected after saponin lysis, before recovering membrane and parasite cytosol proteins by Triton X-100 lysis. The lysates thus obtained are analyzed by Western blot to assess the accuracy of the various extraction steps. This protocol allows the separation of the host compartment from the parasite compartments (PV and parasite), leading to potential studies of host proteins as well as parasite proteins exported to the host cell.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The protocol presented herein is an improvement of a protocol that we initially published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The initial goal of this protocol was to perform the characterization of a <em>P. berghei</em> protein exported by the parasite to its host cell. This allowed the confirmation of immunofluorescence assays showing the export of the proteinâand its blockage by Brefeldin Aâand the analysis of its interactome upon export in the infected erythrocyte (Gnangnon <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>With the aim to provide an improved protocol herein, we refined the technique reported previously by including a percoll gradient step to separate the host cell materials from the parasite ones. After enriching the infected erythrocytes via a Nycodenz<sup>Â®</sup> layer, we use Equinatoxin II (EQTâAnderluh <em>et al.</em>, 1996) to lyse infected erythrocytes, instead of Streptolysin (SLO) as proposed previously (Nyalwidhe and Lingelbach, 2006; Heiber and Spielmann, 2014; KÃ¼lzer <em>et al.</em>, 2015). We made this choice since a few studies have shown that EQT lyses all erythrocytes independently from their infection status, whereas SLO lyses preferentially uninfected erythrocytes (Jackson <em>et al.</em>, 2007; SchÃ¶n <em>et al.</em>, 2008). A percoll gradient is then used to separate the erythrocyte components from the parasite ones. The preparation of this gradient is performed similarly to the one used for <em>P. falciparum</em> (Heiber and Spielmann, 2014).<br/><br/>The parasites embedded in their parasitophorous vacuole (PV) are further treated using saponin, which specifically lyses the PV membrane (KÃ¼lzer <em>et al.</em>, 2015). The final lysis step involves Triton X-100 to recover membrane and parasite cytosol proteins (Heiber and Spielmann, 2014).<br/><br/>Other intermediate lysis steps can also be set up to analyze the parasite compartments more in depth (Ghosh <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The different lysates are analyzed by Western blot. The choice of the antibodies used to detect protein markers of each purified compartment was based on previous studies and on antisera availability from different laboratories (see Table 1) (Knapp <em>et al.</em>, 1990; Kina <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Blisnick <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Hliscs <em>et al.</em>, 2013; KÃ¼lzer <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Meibalan <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Ghosh <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The techniques used here are optimized to the study of <em>P. berghei</em>âinfected erythrocytes (the antibodies listed in Table 1 cross-react with <em>P. berghei</em> antigens despite being initially raised against proteins from other <em>Plasmodium</em> species) and may require some modifications when studying other <em>Plasmodium</em> species. In the case of <em>P. falciparum</em>, the reader can refer to suggestions made by KÃ¼lzer <em>et al.</em> (2015).<br/><br/>The protocol presented here will enable the analysis of the membrane and cytosol of erythrocytes infected by <em>Plasmodium</em> (and maybe other erythrocyte-infecting pathogens like <em>Babesia</em>, following protocol optimization). Further refinements could allow a more precise and specific analysis of all the different compartments of the infected cell at once, which will favor the study of host/pathogen interactions over the parasite intra-erythrocytic development (see the âNotesâ section at the very end of this manuscript). This is of critical importance since this phase of the development cycle of the parasite is responsible for the symptoms of malaria.</p>

This supernatant must be collected carefully without disturbing the pellet, and centrifuged twice for 30 min at 18,000 x g. It is important to note that the Equinatoxin lysis is performed during 15 min, as shorter incubation may provide incomplete lysis of infected erythrocytes, and longer incubation may increase the leakage of parasite content as illustrated by discrete parasite HSP70 staining observed in some cases.</li><li>The pellet P1 obtained after SN1 first centrifugation contains red blood cell ghosts (TER119 positive signal). This pellet should be red. The presence of a black pellet at the bottom of the red one indicates a contamination with parasites. The EXP2 signal observed in Western blot analysis of P1 may correspond to the presence of parasite vesicles in the red blood cell, as described for P. yoelii-infected cells, that would be pelleted along with ghosts during centrifugation (Meibalan et al., 2015).</li></ol></em> </li><li>Centrifuge fractions 2 and 3 at 18,000 <em>x g</em> for 30 min at 4 Â°C and wash three times with 1 ml of 1x PBS to remove the percoll.

Discard all supernatants.<br/><em>Note: The fractions 2 and 3 obtained after the percoll gradient may correspond to red blood cells infected with different stages of the parasite (as observed in Heiber and Spielmann, 2014), even if this is not clear when these fractions are analyzed on smears. Note that we have always observed the same profile of EXP2, HSP70 and Aldolase expression in these two fractions, and that in P. berghei-infected mice, only ring to trophozoite stages are observed in the circulating blood (Janse et al., 2004).</em> </li><li>Prepare the 1x Saponin lysis solution (see Recipe 3).</li><li>Add 1 ml of 1x Saponin lysis solution on pellets 2 and 3 (Step B10) and incubate 10 min on ice.</li><li>Centrifuge Saponin-lysed fractions 2 and 3 at 18,000 <em>x g</em> for 30 min at 4 Â°C. Collect the pellets (to be processed in Step B15). Collect the supernatants into new 1.5 ml tubes and repeat the centrifugation. Collect the supernatants on ice (supernatant SN2s and SN3s).<br/><em>Note: The supernatants SN2s and SN3s collected after saponin lysis correspond to the PV content. Note that it is important to centrifuge these fractions twice for at least 30 min at 18,000 x g to avoid contamination with PV and/or parasite membranes. This can be checked by the absence of EXP2 detection in Western blot analysis. However, the HSP70 signal observed in these supernatants confirms previous results showing that the use of saponin to lyse the PV membrane does not prevent leakage from the parasite compartment (Burghaus and Lingelbach, 2001; Nyalwidhe and Lingelbach, 2006). In the absence of a more specific detergent or enzyme capable of lysing specifically the PV membrane, the study of this compartment that plays a key role in the parasite growth and communication with its host cell remains particularly complex (reviewed in Matz et al., 2020).</em> </li><li>Prepare the Triton lysis solution (see Recipe 4).</li><li>Add 200 Âµl of Triton lysis solution on pellets 2 and 3 from Step B13 and incubate 5 min on ice.</li><li>Centrifuge Triton-lysed fractions 2 and 3 at 18,000 <em>x g</em> for 30 min at 4 Â°C.

This implies that we did not refine the sequential lysis of the PV/parasite compartments (the use of antibodies against EXP2, Aldolase and HSP70 is not discriminant between parasite cytosol and PV/parasite membranes). Elegant techniques involving the use of biotin derivatives have however allowed the isolation the PV and the erythrocyte membrane, prior to their study by OMICs approaches (Nyalwidhe and Lingelbach, 2006; Ravenhill <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The combination of our protocol with these techniques creates perspectives for more sophisticated ways of deciphering the ins and outs of host/pathogen interactions over the intra-erythrocytic cycle of <em>Plasmodium</em> on both the host and the parasite sides.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34262">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>60% Nycodenz solution<br/><strong>Nycodenz buffered medium</strong><br/>5 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5<br/>3 mM KCl<br/>0.3 mM CaNa<sub>2</sub>Â·EDTA<br/><strong>Nycodenz stock solution</strong> <ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 27.6 g solid Nycodenz in 60 ml buffered medium and make up to 100 ml with that medium [density (20 Â°C) 1.15 g/ml]</li><li>Autoclave and store at 4 Â°C</li></ol><strong>60% Nycodenz solution (freshly prepared)</strong><br/>Add 2 ml of 1x PBS to 3 ml of Nycodenz stock solution</li><li>Equinatoxin II (EQT) lysis buffer (to be freshly prepared)<br/>20 âmM Tris pH 7.4<br/>130â mM NaCl<br/>1 âmM MgSO<sub>4</sub><br/>6âÂµg/ml EQT</li><li>Saponin lysis solution<br/><strong>Saponin 10x stock solution</strong><br/>Dissolve 0.7 g Saponin in 100 ml 1x PBS; store at 4 Â°C<br/><strong>1x Saponin lysis solution (to be freshly prepared)</strong><br/>Mix 1 vol of Saponin stock solution with 9 vol 1x PBS</li><li>Triton lysis buffer (to be freshly prepared)<br/>50 mM Tris pH 7.4<br/>100 mM NaCl<br/>1% Triton X-100<br/>0.5 mM EDTA<br/>Roche cOmplete<sup>TM</sup> EDTA-free anti-protease cocktail<br/>0.2 U/ml DNase, store on ice until use</li><li>Percoll gradient layers<br/><strong>90% Percoll stock solution</strong><br/>Mix 45 ml Percoll with 5 ml 10x PBS<br/><strong>80% Percoll layer</strong><br/>Mix 0.5 g D-sorbitol with 8.9 ml 90% Percoll stock solution and 1.1 ml RPMI<br/><strong>70% Percoll layer</strong><br/>Mix 0.5 g D-sorbitol with 7.8 ml 90% Percoll stock solution and 2.2 ml RPMI<br/><strong>60% Percoll layer</strong><br/>Mix 0.5 g D-sorbitol with 6.7 ml 90% Percoll stock solution and 3.3 ml RPMI<br/><strong>40% Percoll layer</strong><br/>Mix 0.5 g D-sorbitol with 4.4 ml 90% Percoll stock solution and 5.6 ml RPMI<br/>Filter all solutions (0.22 Âµm) and store at 4 Â°C</li><li>3x Sample buffer (long storage at -20 Â°Câthaw at RT for use)<br/>150 mM Tris pH 6.5<br/>7.5% SDS<br/>15% Î²-Mercaptoethanol<br/>30% glycerol<br/>0.25% bromophenol blue</li><li>Running buffer (stored for a couple of weeks at 4 Â°C)<br/>3.03 g Tris Base<br/>14.41 g Glycine<br/>5 ml SDS 20%<br/>Add H<sub>2</sub>O to 1 L</li><li>Transfer buffer (stored for a couple of weeks at 4 Â°C)<br/>2.42 g Tris Base<br/>11.26 g Glycine<br/>200 ml EtOH<br/>Add H<sub>2</sub>O to 1 L</li><li>Blocking solution (freshly prepared prior to blocking)<br/>5% Low fat milk in 1x PBS</li><li>Western blot washing buffer (stored for a couple of weeks at 4 Â°C)<br/>0.4% Tween-20 in 1x PBS<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34263">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This work was supported by UniversitÃ© de Lille, CNRS, Inserm and Institut Pasteur de Lille.
