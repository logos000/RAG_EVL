            <h1>Determination of Root Exudate Concentration in the Rhizosphere Using <sup>13</sup>C Labeling</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Laurent  Simon, Feth el Zahar   Haichar</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>One of the most remarkable metabolic features of plant roots is their ability to secrete a wide range of compounds into the rhizosphere, defined as the volume of soil around living roots. Around 5%-21% of total photosynthetically fixed carbon is transferred into the rhizosphere through root exudates. Until recently, studies on the quantity and quality of root exudates were conducted mostly under axenic or monoxenic <em>in vitro</em> conditions. Today, <em>in situ</em> assays are required to provide a better understanding of root exudates dynamics and role in plant-microbe interactions. By incubating plants with <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> <em>in situ</em> for one week and quantifying <sup>13</sup>C enrichment from the root-adhering soil using mass spectrometry, we were able to determine root exudate levels. Indeed, labeled substrate <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> is converted into organic carbon <em>via</em> plant photosynthesis and transferred into the soil through root exudation. We assume that all <sup>13</sup>C increases above natural abundance are mainly derived from exudates produced by <sup>13</sup>C-labeled plants.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Through the exudation of a wide variety of compounds, plants communicate with the soil microbial community in their immediate vicinity, cope with herbivores, foster beneficial symbioses, change the chemical and physical properties of the soil, and inhibit the growth of competing plant species. Understanding how plants differ quantitatively in their root exudate patterns, according to their genotypes and traits as well as to environmental parameters and the soil microbial community is an exciting research challenge. This objective could be achieved by quantifying root exudate content using <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> plant-labeling coupled with a <sup>13</sup>C enrichment measurement from the root-adhering soil using mass spectrometry. This protocol was set up by using different plant species such as <em>Poaceae</em>, legumes (<em>Medicago truncatula</em>), <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>, and Monocotyledon plants such as maize and wheat. As rhizodeposition also depends on plant species, the collection period was after 10 weeks for <em>Poaceae</em> and 4 weeks for the rest. This method can be used with other species, for which the collection period must be set up according to what is known about the studied plant.</p>
