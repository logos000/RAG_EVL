            <h1>Production and Isolation of Magnetic Protein Crystals in HEK293T Cells</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Thomas L. Li, Bianxiao Cui</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Advances in protein engineering have enabled the production of self-assembled protein crystals within living cells. Our recent publication demonstrates the production of ftn-PAK4, which is a ferritin-containing crystal that can mineralize iron and become magnetic when isolated. We have developed an optimized protocol for the production and isolation of PAK4-based crystals. The crystals are first grown in low-passage HEK293T cells, released using a lysis buffer containing NP-40 and DNase, and collected under careful centrifugation conditions. Our protocol maximizes the purity and yield of crystals and is quick and straightforward.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Recent works have reported the production and isolation of â<em>in cellulo</em>â crystals through the heterologous expression of proteins in living cells. These crystals have varied applications, such as cargo delivery (Ijiri <em>et al.</em>, 2009) or x-ray structure determination (Baskaran and Ang, 2015). The properties of the crystals vary, but they are generally quite large relative to the cell, ranging from 1-2 Î¼m up to hundreds of Î¼m in size (SchÃ¶nherr <em>et al.</em>, 2015). In our recent work, we modified inka-PAK4 crystals to create ftn-PAK4, which is a ferritin-containing crystal that can mineralize enough iron to be attracted to a nearby permanent magnet (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>The production and isolation of intact protein crystals poses several unique experimental challenges. Because the crystals are so large, purification methods such as gel electrophoresis cannot be used. Likewise, because the crystals are protein-based, harsher lysis conditions such as SDS will disassemble the crystals. However, clean suspensions can be critical for downstream applications. For example, excessive debris in an inka-PAK4 suspension can trap auto-oxidized iron and stick to crystals, generating spurious magnetic attraction results.<br/><br/>Here, we present a protocol for the production, isolation, and iron loading of ftn-PAK4 and inka-PAK4 crystals. It is possible to achieve results using only deionized water as the lysis buffer, but we present several optimizations that significantly improve crystal yield and minimize unwanted debris. These considerations should inform future work on other protein crystals, both for their production and isolation as well as their functional applications.<br/></p>

Ensure that the cells have not been passaged more than 10 times before transfection.<br/><em>Note: Cells can be plated any time before transfection, including immediately beforehand, as long as the density is 60% at the time of transfection.</em> </li><li>Transfection<br/>Transfect HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions.<ol class="npwthree"><li>Use 2 Î¼g of total plasmid, and 6 Î¼l of Lipofectamine 2000 per well, for a 1:3 plasmid to reagent ratio.</li><li>To produce ftn-PAK4, use 1 Î¼g of ftn-PAK4 plasmid and 1 Î¼g of inka-PAK4 plasmid. To produce inka-PAK4, use 2 Î¼g of inka-PAK4 plasmid. The plasmid concentration is not important, only the total mass of DNA.</li><li>To aid in crystal visualization through fluorescence microscopy, include 0.2 Î¼g GFP-PAK4 plasmid in the plasmid mix.

While inka-PAK4 crystals should be immediately visible, ftn-PAK4 crystals may not be obvious after 24 h. To maximize crystal yield and size, maintain cells in culture for 72 h after transfection before isolation (Figure 1).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200716/20200716034422_2575.jpg" width="101"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

Add 500 Î¼l lysis buffer and 10 Î¼l DNase solution directly to the cell culture well, and place on a rocker at 50 tilts/min at room temperature for 40 min.<br/>The presence of DNase in the lysis buffer is critical to high yields. Without DNase, a sticky pellet will form from the lysed cellsâ DNA, which will trap most of the crystals (Figure 2).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200716/20200716034455_3973.jpg" width="180"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

Centrifuge at 400 rcf for 1 min in a swinging-bucket centrifuge. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 Î¼l of 0.1 M HEPES buffer.<br/><em>Note: The supernatant will still contain crystals, which can be collected using a second centrifugation.</em> </li><li>Verify Isolation<br/>Check crystal yield by pipetting a few Î¼l of the suspension onto a coverslip and looking at it under the microscope. Isolated crystals should be visible through the eyepiece using a 10x objective under both brightfield and GFP illuminations.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Iron loading and assay<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Add Iron<br/>Prepare a solution of FAS (50 mM, 100x) and mannitol (500 mM, 100x) in sterile deionized water. Add 1 Î¼l of each stock solution to a 100 Î¼l aliquot of the crystal suspension. Incubate at room temperature for exactly 15 min.<br/><em>Notes:</em><br/><ol class="npwthree"><li><em>The final concentrations are 500 Î¼M FAS and 5 mM mannitol.

The darker this color is, the more Fe<sup>3+</sup> precipitate there is.</em> </li></ol></li><li>Wash Iron<br/>Centrifuge samples at 400 rcf in a swinging bucket centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100 Î¼l of HEPES buffer.<br/><em>Notes:</em><br/><ol class="npwthree"><li><em>It is important to match the volume of the wash buffer with the original suspension volume. If a larger volume, like 500 Î¼l, is used, the ftn-PAK4 suspension may not pellet during centrifugation, though the WT-PAK4 will.</em> </li><li><strong><em>Common failure</em></strong><em>: If the resulting pellet is a yellow/orange color, the iron incubation step was likely too long, and analysis will be confounded by the presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> precipitates.</em> </li></ol></li><li>Prepare Prussian Blue (PB) Stain<br/>Prepare a solution of 5% concentrated HCl v/v and 1% potassium ferrocyanide w/v in water.<br/><em>Note: It is important to prepare the PB stain immediately before use, because Fe<sup>2+</sup> will oxidize and create Prussian Blue over time. While this oxidized solution will still work for approximately 48 h, it will contain a significant suspension of Prussian Blue particles.</em> </li><li>Add PB Stain<br/>To verify iron loading, pipet a 10 Î¼l droplet of iron-loaded PAK4 crystals onto a glass slide or coverslip and add 1 Î¼l of the PB stain. The droplet can be immediately checked under brightfield optical microscopy (Figure 3).<br/><em>Note: If iron loading is successful, ftn-PAK4 crystals should have a deep blue color in the center. Inka-PAK4 crystals may be a faint blue, depending on the optics of the microscope.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200716/20200716034520_0074.jpg" width="180"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.
