            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Acid ecto-phosphatases are enzymes that hydrolyze phosphomonoesters in the acidic pH range with their active sites facing the extacellular medium. Their activities can be measured in living cells. In bacteria and protozoan pathogens, acid ecto-phosphatases have been associated with the survival of intracellular pathogens within phagocytes through inhibition of the respiratory burst, suggesting that they act as virulence factors. Extracellular acid phosphatase activity in <em>Leishmania (L.) donovani</em> has been associated with the degree of promastigote virulence/infectivity. The levels of acid ecto-phosphatase activity in different <em>Leishmania</em> sp or even strains of the same species vary and this has been linked to their virulence. It may also be related to their ability to survive and multiply in the insect host.<br/><br/>Acid phosphatase enzymatic activity can be measured in crude membrane fractions and in membrane fractions enriched in plasma membrane, however, in these cases, the intracellular acid phosphatases, mainly localized in lysosomes, contribute to the final result. Therefore, measuring phosphatase activity at the surface of live cells in acidic pH range is the only accurate way to measure acid ecto-phosphatase activity. This assay is performed at 25 Â°C or 37 Â°C for 30 min using as substrate the generic phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (<em>p</em>NPP), in a citrate buffer, with or without sodium tartrate (L(+)-tartaric acid), as histidine acid phosphatases are classified according to their sensitivity to tartate inhibition. The steps of the protocol consist of pelleting cells in suspension, in this case <em>Leishmania</em> promastigotes, washing twice with HEPES buffer, resuspending the cells in the substrate reaction mixture and terminating the reaction by the addition of 0.5 N NaOH. The cells are removed by centrifugation and the absorbance of the reaction product (<em>p</em>-nitrophenolate=<em>p</em>NP) in the supernatant is measured at 405 nm. The enzymatic activity (A<sub>405</sub> values) is normalized for the mean number of cells/ml used for each independent experiment. <br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Trypanosomatid protozoan parasites are a diverse group of primitive parasitic organisms (Kaufer <em>et al.</em>, 2017). They are both of medical and veterinary importance as many Trypanosomatid species cause serious or fatal diseases in humans and agricultural animals in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide (Reference 16). Virulence factors of these parasites include molecules expressed on their cell surface as well as those secreted or shed into the extracellular medium (Gottlieb and Dwyer, 1981; Fonseca-de-Souza <em>et al.</em>, 2008 and 2009). Trypanosomatidae are exposed to diverse environmental stimuli throughout their life cycles in all biological systems they reside. Central events in recognition of the external and internal signals in these cells, which lead to specific responses for adaptation and survival in all these environments, are protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events carried out by a multitude of kinases and phosphatases. The trypanosomatid kinome and phosphatome have been recently deciphered (Brenchley <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Sadatomi <em>et al.</em>, 2013). <br/><br/>Phosphatase activities modulate different aspects of the infection by members of the trypanosomatid family (Neves <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Ecto-phosphatases, the enzymes localized in parasiteâs surface membranes, are of special interest as they are candidate molecules for the interaction between the parasite and its host and thereby they could be intimately involved in many cellular events implicated in parasite adhesion to the host, protection from the hostâs immune response and establishment of infection. Moreover, several alternative functions have been suggested for ecto-phosphatases, such as participation in proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, virulence and infection (Katakura and Kobayashi, 1988; Singla <em>et al.</em>, 1992). Little is known about their physiological roles in protozoa parasites (Cosentino-Gomes <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Gomes <em>et al.</em>, 2011). In particular, acid ecto-phosphatases that hydrolyze phosphomonoesters at acidic pHs, have been associated with the survival of intracellular parasites within phagocytes through inhibition of the respiratory burst (Saha <em>et al.</em>, 1985; Remaley <em>et al.</em>, 1985; Baca <em>et al.</em>, 1993; Reilly <em>et al.</em>, 1996; Jungnitz <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Saleh and Belisle, 2000; Burtnick <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Steenkamp, 2002; Cosentino-Gomes <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Aragon <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Cosentino-Gomes and Meyer-Fernandes, 2011), suggesting that they may act as virulence factors (Katakura and Kobayashi, 1988; Singla <em>et al.</em>, 1992; Papadaki <em>et al.</em>, 2015). They may also be related to the ability of parasites to survive and multiply in the insect host (Remaley <em>et al.</em>, 1985; Saha <em>et al.</em>, 1985; Singla <em>et al.</em>, 1992). The field of the acid ecto-phosphatases was reopened with the characterization of the <em>L. donovani</em> acid ecto-phosphatase <em>Ld</em>MAcP (Papadaki <em>et al.</em>, 2015) and the identification of at least two more open reading frames in the <em>L. donovani</em> genome that could be potentially expressed at the surface membrane of the parasites (Papadaki and Boleti. data not published). <br/><br/>Therefore assaying acid phosphate activity at the surface of live cells is a putative diagnostic parameter for virulence of <em>Leishmania</em> parasite strains as well as for the evaluation of the expression of the ecto-phosphatases under study at the surface of transgenic parasite strains overexpressing them.Acid phosphatase enzymatic activity can be measured in crude membrane fractions and in membrane fractions enriched in plasma membrane (Glew <em>et al.</em>, 1982; Shakarian <em>et al.</em>, 2002), however, in these cases, the intracellular acid phosphatases, mainly localized in lysosomes, contribute to the final result. <br/><br/>The protocol provided herein was used to measure acid ecto-phosphatase activity in live <em>Leishmania</em> promastigotes but it could be used to detect and quantitate acid ecto-phosphatase activity in all suspension cells of prokaryotic or eukaryotic origin. <br/><br/>Our method was adapted from previously described methodologies (Remaley <em>et al.</em>, 1985; Saha <em>et al.</em>, 1985; Katakura and Kobayashi, 1988; Singla <em>et al.</em>, 1992) for assaying ecto-phosphatases in other organisms.<br/></p>
