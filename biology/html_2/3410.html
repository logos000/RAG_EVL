            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Neglected tropical diseases gain the scientific interest of numerous research programs in an attempt to achieve their effective control or elimination. In this attempt, more cutting-edge public health policies and research are needed for the discovery of new, safer and effective drugs originated from natural products. Here, we describe protocols for the <em>in vitro</em> screening of a natural product-derived compound required for the determination of its antileishmanial potency. For this purpose, the Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) derived from extra virgin olive oil is evaluated through the <em>in vitro</em> cell culture method against extracellular promastigote and intracellular amastigote <em>Leishmania</em> spp. forms. The aim of this article is to describe a step-by-step procedure that can be easily applied to accurately estimate the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>), the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) and the selectivity index (SI) via the resazurin reduction assay. These protocols are based on the ability of resazurin (oxidized blue form) to be irreversibly reduced by enzymes in viable cells and generate a red fluorescent resorufin product and can be easily expanded to the investigation of the antimicrobial activity in other microorganisms.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of about 20 diseases, typically endemic in 149 tropical and subtropical countries that represent a significant public health impact worldwide by affecting more than 1 billion people and being responsible for over 500,000 deaths per year (Cheuka <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Mitra and Mawson, 2017). Until nowadays, drug discovery against NTDs exhibited limited success in translating potential drug candidates into effective therapies. Indeed, the current clinically used drugs against NTDs are characterized by various disadvantages including severe adverse effects, complicated administration procedures, lengthy treatment duration and emergence of resistance (Cheuka <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Natural products represent a valuable alternative source of novel and structurally diverse compounds that deserves attention in drug discovery against NTDs. Numerous metabolites isolated from plant, microbial and marine sources such as alkaloids, phenolic compounds, quinones, terpenes, saponins, lignans, toxoids and anthranoids have been investigated (Cheuka <em>et al.</em>, 2016) and it has been estimated that approximately at least 25% of the presently used drugs in modern medicine are derived from plants (Lahlou, 2007). <br/><br/>Among NTDs, leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoa of the genus <em>Leishmania</em> spp., causing a range of manifestations and exhibiting progressively increasing frequency in non-endemic western developed countries (Burza <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Numerous of agents of natural origin, plant derived bioactive compounds and their secondary metabolites have been tested as antileishmanial drugs, such as flavonoids, sterols, chalcones, coumarins, tannins and aurones, iridoids, quinones and quinolone alkaloids (Singh <em>et al.</em>, 2014). The assessment of the bioactive potential of biological extracts or molecules involves numerous assays performed at animal, cell-based or molecular levels (Lage <em>et al.</em>, 2018) while the first steps of the biological screening and evaluation of plant extracts usually involve the screening of compounds in cell-based <em>in vitro</em> assays (Griffiths and Sundaram, 2011).<br/><br/>The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) is a representative quantitative measure of the potency of a substance to inhibit <em>in vitro</em> a specific biological process by 50%, (Lahlou, 2007; Aykul and Martinez-Hackert, 2016) and is primarily defined through <em>in vitro</em> test models. Since <em>Leishmania</em> spp. have a digenetic life cycle, the antileishmanial effect of drugs is tested on both the promastigote (infective form in the intermediate host) and the amastigote form (intracellular form in the tissue of the mammalian host) (Bates and Rogers, 2004). In this regard, IC<sub>50</sub> is determined for both promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes and is defined as the concentration of a compound that causes inhibition of growth in the 50% of <em>Leishmania</em> promastigotes and of intracellular amastigotes, respectively. To this end, the <em>in vitro</em> screening of the antileishmanial activity of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) is performed on <em>L. infantum</em> and <em>L. major</em> promastigotes and on Leishmania-infected J774A.1 macrophages in which amastigotes survive and multiply (Bilbao-Ramos <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Moreover, the cytotoxicity of TPF <em>in vitro</em> against J774A.1 macrophages is also tested through the determination of the CC<sub>50</sub> (cytotoxicity concentration 50%) that is the compoundâs concentration that causes cytotoxicity in the 50% of the cells (Kyriazis <em>et al.</em>, 2013). In addition, we employ the selectivity index (SI) that is defined as the ratio of the 50% cytotoxic concentration of J774A.1 macrophages to the 50% inhibitory concentration of <em>Leishmania</em> spp. amastigotes (CC<sub>50</sub>/IC<sub>50</sub>). A compound with SI value greater than 1 is considered to be more selective against <em>Leishmania</em> spp. parasites and is regarded as a promising potential agent in the treatment of leishmaniasis (Makwali <em>et al.</em>, 2015). All the above indices are crucial in order to conclude whether or not a tested compound is appropriate as an antileishmanial agent. </p>

Subsequently, the maintenance of </em><em>Leishmania</em><em> spp. virulence is achieved by continuous passage in BALB/c mice. Tissue amastigotes are obtained after homogenization either of spleen tissue in case of </em><em>L. infantum</em><em> or popliteal lymph node in case of </em><em>L. major</em><em>. Transformation of intracellular amastigotes to infective promastigotes is achieved during culture in complete RPMI-1640 medium at 26 Â°C. Parasite cultures are subcultured into fresh medium (usually at day 4 depending on </em><em>Leishmania</em><em> strain, after every passage) until they reach the 10<sup>th</sup> subculture (Nasiri </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2013). The appropriate inoculum dose of </em><em>Leishmania</em><em> spp. promastigotes is usually 2 x 10</em><sup><em>6</em></sup><em> parasites per ml.</em> </li><li>Allow parasites to enter stationary-growth phase at 26 Â°C. Then promastigotes are removed by gently pipetting using a sterile disposable transfer pipette.<br/><em>Note: </em><em>Leishmania</em><em> spp. promastigotes usually enter the stationary-growth phase after 3 to 5 days, depending on the </em><em>Leishmania</em><em> strain. For example, </em><em>L. major</em><em>, a commonly used strain, approximately enters the stationary growth phase at Day 4 when it reaches the number of 3.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> parasites/ml (Nasiri </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2013). </em> </li><li>Determine the number of <em>Leishmania</em> spp. promastigotes per ml by differential counting of dead and live parasites using the Trypan blue exclusion dye (Recipe 6) in a Malassez counting chamber under an optical microscope.<br/><em>Note: The final dilution of promastigotes in Trypan blue dye depends on the density of the </em><em>in vitro</em><em> parasite culture. Usually, a 1:20 final dilution of promastigotes is suitable at the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>rth</sup> day of the </em><em>in vitro</em><em> culture. Additionally, promastigotes have to be fixed with 2% (v/v) formalin before counting. </em> </li><li>Seed 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> <em>L. infantum</em> promastigotes and 7.4 x 10<sup>5</sup> <em>L. major</em> promastigotes per well in a final volume of 100 Âµl of complete RPMI-1640 medium in separate 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plate for each strain, under a sterile biosafety cabinet.<br/><em>Note: Different concentrations of stationary phase </em><em>L. infantum</em><em> and </em><em>L. major</em><em> promastigotes (e.g., 10</em><sup><em>4</em></sup><em>, 2.5 x 10</em><sup><em>4</em></sup><em>, 5 x 10</em><sup><em>4</em></sup><em>, 7.5 x 10</em><sup><em>4</em></sup><em>, 10</em><sup><em>5</em></sup><em>, 2.5 x 10</em><sup><em>5</em></sup><em>, 5 x 10</em><sup><em>5</em></sup><em>, 7.5 x 10</em><sup><em>5</em></sup><em>, 10</em><sup><em>6</em></sup><em> in a final volume of 200 Âµl/well) are usually screened before the experimentâs set-up in order to determine the optimal cell density (Corral </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2013).</em> </li><li>Add various increasing concentrations of TPF (5-400 Âµg/ml) in triplicates and fill in the wells with complete RPMI-1640 medium until the final volume of 200 Âµl per well.<br/><em>Note: Concentrations of plant extracts may vary depending on the natural product.</em> </li><li>Add one reference drug (<em>i.e.</em>, one drug currently subscribed for the chemotherapy of leishmaniasis) in triplicate at the appropriate 50% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>). Hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) is used at the concentrations of 3.3 Âµg/ml and 6.4 Âµg/ml for <em>L. infantum</em> and <em>L. major</em> promastigotes respectively, as previously described (Koutsoni <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</li><li>Triplicates of different kinds of negative controls are also included.
