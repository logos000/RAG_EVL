            <h1>Co-immunostaining of ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and CD31 in Mouse Kidney Glomeruli</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sun-sang J. Sung</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a common pathological condition in chronic kidney diseases that often leads to end stage renal failure. Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18)-mediated neutrophil, macrophage, and dendritic cell glomerular infiltration leading to cellular dysfunction and destruction is an important disease mechanism. The cellular distribution and dynamics of the expression of Mac-1 ligands ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 in GN have not been well studied because of the difficulties in tissue staining and colocalizing glomerular cells with surface antigens. To improve the visualization of cell surface marker and antigen expression in kidney compartments, we have devised an even but mild fixation procedure employing p-formaldehyde-lysine-periodate (PLP) perfusion. A large panel of antibodies (Ab) against cell surface markers was used to identify kidney cell types and adhesion molecules. When confocal microscopy was used in visualizing glomerular adhesion molecule staining, the endothelial cells were found to specifically express CD31, and these cells express ICAM-2 constitutively. Though ICAM-1 was not expressed by glomerular endothelial cells in homeostasis, it was highly upregulated in mice with chronic GN and severe proteinuria. VCAM-1, a ligand for VLA-4 important in leukocyte migration, was not expressed in the glomerulus. The results highlight the importance of ICAM-1 in the infiltration of macrophages and dendritic cells in cGN. This report will provide a widely applicable procedure for yielding high quality confocal images and for the identification and quantitation of receptors and other cellular antigens expressed in different kidney compartments and cell types.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The glomerulus plays a central role in the ultrafiltration function of the kidney by the formation of a semipermeable filtration barrier between the circulation and the urinary space (Dickinson, 2016). It is composed of a network of capillaries formed by fenestrated endothelial cells lined by podocytes with interdigitating foot-processes forming slit diaphragms for selective filtration and mesangial cells which provide mechanical support and contractile functions. Most chronic kidney diseases and a large percentage of end stage renal disease exhibit glomerulus involvement and glomerulonephritis (GN) is the underlying cause in 40% of patients with chronic kidney disease (Jha <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Foster, 2016; Lindenmeyer and Kretzler, 2017). Leukocyte infiltration and immune complex deposition are largely responsible for the initiation and progression of GN with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and macrophages constituting the predominant infiltrating cell types (Devi <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Dickinson, 2016; Sung <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Almarza Novoa <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Leukocyte transmigration into the glomerulus is dependent on chemokine and adhesion molecule functions (Filippi, 2016; Sung <em>et al.</em>, 2017). For PMN and monocyte adhesion and diapedesis into the subendothelial space and the mesangium, CD11b function is of particular significance (Ernandez and Mayadas, 2016; Filippi, 2016; Sung <em>et al.</em>, 2017). This Î²2 integrin binds ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 which are expressed by glomerular intrinsic cells, especially the endothelial cells (Devi <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Filippi, 2016; Sung <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The expression of integrin Î²1 and Î²2 ligands including ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells are modulated by changes in the inflammatory environments but their expression within the glomerulus is not well-studied. To understand cellular interactions in GN pathogenesis, microscopic examination of the dynamics of cell type-specific expression of adhesion molecules is critical (Devi <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Sung <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Studies by confocal microscopy have provided a clearer understanding of leukocyte emigration in the glomerulus. Unequivocal definition of expression specificity in this microscopic technique requires (1) availability of glomerular cell type-specific Ab; (2) optimized methods for tissue preparation and fixation; (3) availability of Ab for detecting the antigenic epitopes; and (4) adequate signal to noise ratio. In the past, difficulties arising from one or more of these issues have resulted in suboptimal detection of integrin expression by glomerular cells. Some of the issues in kidney glomerulus staining are summarized below. The first is the high autofluorescence and nonspecific binding of renal tubules. The autofluorescence of cortical tubules is particularly notable. The problem of nonspecific staining is especially severe when secondary Ab are used. Availability of reagents poses another hurdle since fluorescence-tagged Ab for staining kidney glomerular intrinsic cell types such as podocyte and mesangial cells are not commercially available. Furthermore, with the staining of frozen sections, as is often the case, the images are diffuse and lack resolution compared to fixed tissues (Figure 1, cf. HLA-DR staining (arrows) in panel Aâfrozen and panel Bâfixed sections). This report describes a mild kidney fixation method for preserving tissue architecture and Ab-binding antigenic epitopes. Ab conjugated with fluorescence tags for background reduction were used to identify glomerular cell expression of integrins in homeostatic and inflamed kidneys. The procedure yielded sharp images of glomerular endothelial cells expressing ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 and extraglomerular tubular cells expressing VCAM-1. The method is applicable to studies on cellular interactions and receptor and cytokine expression by other kidney cell types such as inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="103" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200630/20200630184356_9941.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

VCAM-1 staining was restricted to the extraglomerular interstitial region (Figures 5A-b, f). Podocytes and mesangial cells identified by nephrin and integrin Î±8 respectively expressed little ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 (not shown). The results suggest that in homeostasis PMN and monocyte adhesion to glomerular endothelial cells through CD11b is largely dependent on Mac-1/ICAM-2 but not Mac-1/ICAM-1 interaction. The results also show that Î²1 integrins such as VLA-4 (Î±4Î²1) which binds VCAM-1 play negligible roles in myeloid cell adhesion in the glomerulus.</li><li>In mice with anti-glomerular basement membrane-induced nephritis, little change from control mice in the localization of ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and VCAM-1 was found (Figure 5B).</li><li>There were remarkable changes in the ICAM-1 expression in NZM2328 mice with chronic GN from non-diseased mice (cf., Figures 5C with 5A, panels a, b, c). In sick mice, ICAM-1 was highly expressed and occurred predominantly in the glomeruli. ICAM-1 colocalized with endothelial cells expressing CD31 (Figure 5C, panels a, b, c) instead of being periglomerular as in control mice (Figure 5A, panels a, b, c). This ICAM-1 upregulation may play significant roles in the infiltration of macrophages in the glomeruli of mice with chronic GN (Figure 5 in Sung <em>et al.</em>, 2017). ICAM-2 expression in the glomerulus of mice with chronic GN (Figure 5C, panels a, e) was similar to that of nondiseased mice (Figure 5A, panels a, e). Since macrophage glomerular infiltration is correlated with ICAM-1 and not ICAM-2 expression in the glomerulus, it is likely that ICAM-2 plays minor or insignificant roles in macrophage glomerular emigration in cGN. By the same token, VCAM-1 expression remained extraglomerular (Figures 5C-b, f), indicating that VLA-4 plays little or no role in macrophage glomerular emigration in mice with severe GN.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200630/20200630185358_4006.jpg" width="111"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.
