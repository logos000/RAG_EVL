            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Developing axons change responsiveness to guidance cues during the journey to synapse with target cells. Axon crossing at the ventral midline serves as a model for studying how axons accomplish such a switch in their response. Although primary neuron culture has been a versatile technique for elucidating various developmental mechanisms, many <em>in vivo</em> characteristics of neurons, such as long axon-extending abilities and axonal compartments, are not thoroughly preserved. In explant cultures, such properties of differentiated neurons and tissue architecture are maintained. To examine how the midline repellent Slit regulated the distribution of the Robo receptor in spinal cord commissural axons upon midline crossing and whether Robo trafficking machinery was a determinant of midline crossing, novel explant culture systems were developed. We have combined an âopen-bookâ spinal cord explant method with that devised for flat-mount retinae. Here we present our protocol for explant culture of embryonic mouse spinal cords, which allows flexible manipulation of experimental conditions, immunostaining of extending axons and quantitative analysis of individual axons. In addition, we present a modified method that combines <em>ex vivo</em> electroporation and âclosed-bookâ spinal cord explant culture. These culture systems provide new platforms for detailed analysis of axon guidance, by adapting gene knockdown, knockout and genome editing.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Growing axons sense numerous extracellular cues to reach their final target cells (Stoeckli, 2018). At intermediate targets on the way to the destination, axons timely switch on/off responses to guidance cues. Molecular mechanisms underlying this switch have been a hot topic in neurobiology (Guan and Rao, 2003; Sabatier <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Dickson and Zou, 2010; Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011; Stoeckli, 2018; Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Ducuing <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>The ventral midline of the central nervous system is an important intermediate target for different types of axons. Floor plate (FP) cells at the ventral midline secrete short- and long-range guidance cues, which act as attractants or repellents, and spatiotemporally organize the formation of neural circuits. Commissural axons project across the midline, connect the left and right sides of the nervous system and play roles in information transfer between both sides (Figures 1A and 1B). Commissural axons are initially guided to the midline by attractants derived from the FP and ventricular zones, such as netrin-1 and Sonic hedgehog (Dominici <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Varadarajan <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Moreno-Bravo <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2019). At the midline, commissural axons lose their responsiveness to the attractants and acquire responsiveness to repellents, such as Slit and semaphorins (Shirasaki <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Zou <em>et al.</em>, 2000). Thus, the midline is initially an attractive target for commissural axons, but becomes an unfavorable place upon their arrival, so that commissural axons exit the midline and never re-cross it. What mechanism ensures that commissural axons cross the midline only once? One key is the molecular basis by which commissural axons increase Slit sensitivity upon midline crossing.<br/><br/>Here we will summarize how spinal cord explant cultures have contributed to our understanding of axon guidance. The landmark research using explants showed that FP cells produce chemoattractant activity for commissural axons (Tessier-Lavigne <em>et al.</em>, 1988). Two-dimensional co-culture assays using explants of commissural neurons and the FP revealed the presence of unknown midline repellent activity, which is unmasked by inhibiting either axonin-1/TAG-1 (a cell adhesion molecule [CAM] expressed in commissural axons) or NrCAM (expressed in FP cells) (Stoeckli <em>et al.</em>, 1997). When Slit was identified as a ligand for Robo receptor and a long-awaited midline repellent (Brose <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Kidd <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Li <em>et al.</em>, 1999), its repellent activity for vertebrate commissural axons was not clarified. But soon later, ingenious assay systems using FP-containing and FP-lacking spinal cord explants embedded in collagen gel revealed that Slit inhibits outgrowth of commissural axons that have crossed the midline (post-crossing axons), but not pre-crossing axons (Zou <em>et al.</em>, 2000). This was the first demonstration that Slit is an evolutionally conserved midline repellent.<br/><br/>To examine how Slit sensitivity of commissural axons was regulated, we established a primary culture system (Kinoshita-Kawada <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Yuasa-Kawada <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Commissural neurons dissociated from dorsal spinal cords of mouse embryos at post-crossing stages (embryonic day [E]11.5-12.5) exhibit growth cone collapse and the increase in axonal Robo1 levels in response to Slit. In contrast, commissural neurons harvested from pre-crossing stage embryos show neither collapse responses to Slit nor the Slit-induced increase in axonal Robo1. Therefore, even without FP cells, dissociated commissural neurons recapitulate <em>in vivo</em> behaviors, with respect to the acquisition of Slit responsiveness. We then sought to develop an explant assay to examine Slit-induced Robo redistribution and growth cone responses in individual axons (or small fascicles) in a more physiological context, with subcellular resolution. Unfortunately, it was difficult to use so far developed explant assays for such purposes, because axons tended to form vigorous bundles in collagen gel.<br/><br/>To study retinotectal topography, Drs. Friedrich Bonhoeffer, Uli Schwarz and colleagues developed retinal explant culture systems; a large mass of embryonic retinae were flat-mounted onto nitrocellulose (NC) filters and placed on the tectal cell membrane carpets, allowing robust extension of retinal axons (Halfter <em>et al.</em>, 1981 and 1983; Bonhoeffer and Huf, 1982; Walter <em>et al.</em>, 1987a and 1987b; Ichijo and Bonhoeffer, 1998; Yuasa-Kawada <em>et al.</em>, 2003). By combining these protocols with spinal cord explant techniques (Zou <em>et al.</em>, 2000), we prepared FP-lacking dorsal spinal cord [dSC (-FP)] and FP-containing hemisected spinal cord [SC (+FP)] explants (from cervical to lumbar levels) from E11.5 embryos and spread them on NC filters. Such explants were cultured on the Matrigel-coated substratum (Figures 1C-1G). Under these conditions, individual axons robustly extended from explants onto the two-dimensional surface, even without netrin-1, a stimulator of commissural axon growth. In both explant types, the extending axons were negative for TAG-1, a pre-crossing commissural axon marker but positive for L1, a post-crossing commissural axon marker (Dodd <em>et al.</em>, 1988), maintaining the characteristics of post-crossing axons (Figure 3). These explant cultures allow simple immunostaining protocols and testing effects of Slit alone on Robo distribution (Kinoshita-Kawada <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>Furthermore, to perform RNA interference (RNAi) against transducers of Slit-Robo signals, Arf6 GTPase and cytohesin Arf-guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Arf-GEFs), we modified an RNAi-based assay that combines <em>ex utero</em> electroporation with spinal cord explant culture (Wolf <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Parra and Zou, 2010). Because the spinal cord, especially the FP region, becomes too fragile to prepare open-book explants after electroporation, we developed a new culture system of intact, âclosed-bookâ spinal cords embedded in collagen gel (Kinoshita-Kawada <em>et al.</em>, 2019) (Figures 2A-2D). The combination of these culture systems with RNAi-mediated knockdown or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based genome editing, introduced by electroporation, virus or nanocomplex (<em>e.g.</em>, Mikuni <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Nishiyama <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Park <em>et al.</em>, 2019), will allow more flexibility to manipulate experimental conditions and to tag endogenous proteins. Such techniques will contribute to the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of axon guidance.</p>

Care should be taken so that the uteri do not touch the body surface of the mouse.</li><li>To reduce the possibility of contamination, wash uteri at least once, twice if possible, by transferring them to HCMF-containing 100 mm dish(es).</li></ol></li><li>Dissecting out embryos from the uterus<br/><em>Note: The following procedure can be performed outside the laminar flow hood.</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li>Place a dish containing the uteri under a dissecting microscope (We performed all subsequent procedures under a dissecting microscope). Using two pairs of blunt No. 5 Inox forceps, tear the uterine horn of each uterus carefully and isolate the embryos from their placentas and amniotic membranes. To avoid damages of embryos, we do not separate the uterus during isolation (keep the state of âpeas in a podâ). By using a spatula, transfer the embryos into new HCMF-containing dishes. Take care not to damage embryonic bodies, especially the spinal cord. Frequently wipe forceps and other tools with 70% ethanol. These procedures, from isolating embryos to mounting explants before cultivation, can be performed outside the laminar flow hood, but keep the environment and your tools clean. For isolation of E11.5 mouse embryos from the uterus, see also Elhendawi and Davies, 2018.</li><li>Check the pooled embryos, and discard those that appear damaged, malformed, abnormal, or too small and too large. By staging the embryos with the EMAP system (mentioned above), select appropriate embryos at E11.5 or earlier stages.</li></ol></li><li>Isolation of spinal cords<ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissection should be performed as quickly as possible, and the dishes containing the remaining embryos should be kept on ice. Transfer 3-4 embryos per 60 mm HCMF-containing dish. First, remove almost all of the ventral organs from the embryo body by using two blunt No. 5 Inox forceps. At this step, we do not use scissors. We obtain the brain and spinal cords together with the surrounding tissues. Next, make an incision at the hindbrain-rostral spinal cord region by using blunt forceps. Dissect out the hindbrain and spinal cord regions from the vertebra, in the rostral-to-caudal direction. Do not peel off the meninges yet; the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) may also be attached. Using a cut pipette (cut the tip of the transfer pipettes with opening of approximately 4-5 mm), transfer the spinal cords (with the meninges) into new HCMF-containing dishes. It is better to quickly proceed to the step of mounting the spinal cords onto ConA-coated black NC filters. In our experience, the shorter period between dissecting out spinal cords and mounting them on NC filters results in better axon growth.</li><li>By using two pairs of sharpened No. 5 Inox forceps (alternatively, ophthalmic scissors), tear (or cut) the dorsal midline (roof plate [RP]) of the spinal cord that is still covered with the meninges (Figure 1D), and open up the entire length of spinal cord like a book (we usually tear the RP by grabbing the adjacent meninges, but not spinal cord proper, with forceps) (see Figure 1K). Next, peel off the meninges from the spinal cord in the rostral-to-caudal direction, by sweeping between the outer surface of spinal cords and meninges, with the forceps. As shown in Figure 1C, at this point, we obtain the spinal cords from the cervical to lumbar levels (by cutting the open-book spinal cord with forceps).</li></ol></li><li>Preparation of spinal cord explant culture<ol class="npwthree"><li>For dSC (-FP) explants: immediately dissect out the dorsal half of the spinal cords (see the cutting lines shown in Figure 1E) with a tungsten needle (Figure 1H).</li><li>For SC (+FP) explants: immediately cut the spinal cord at the opposite edge of the FP (Figure 1E) with a tungsten needle.<br/><em>Note: Do not pool open-book spinal cords or the dSC (-FP)/SC (+FP) explants. If pooled, they will become curled and very difficult to mount onto the NC filter. When one explant is ready, start the Step B5c.</em> </li><li>We usually mark the dorso-caudal corner of the explants by cutting diagonally (Figure 1F). Using a wet pipette (it should be noted that explants can easily adhere to dry surfaces and be damaged), immediately transfer the dSC (-FP) or SC (+FP) explant into a coverslip- and Medium 3-containing dish. Spread the explant on a strip of the ConA-coated black NC filter (Figures 1F, 1J and 1L). To fix the position of the explant, nail the explant on the NC filter by using blunt forceps, without using real ânailsâ, and with the pial side downward (Figure 1L (i)). For dSC (-FP) explants, an extra care not to include any piece of FP tissues into the dish should be taken. We strongly recommend mounting the spinal cord one by one, and immediately after the meninges are peeled off.<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwfour"><li><em>Use un-cut pipettes for transferring the excised spinal cord explant ready for mounting. The un-cut pipettes, rather than cut pipettes, are suitable for handling small pieces of nerual tissues.</em> </li><li><em>For preparing retinal explants, researchers usually âblotâ retinal tissues that are spread on the NC filter, further onto a dry filter paper, so that the retina becomes firmly attached to the NC filter (</em><em>e.g.</em><em>, see Bonhoeffer and Huf, 1982). However, we found that this procedure does not improve axon growth in spinal cord explants and may even compromise tissue integrity. Thus, we do not perform the blotting procedure to prepare spinal cord explants.</em> </li></ol></li><li>Have two spinal cords mounted on the NC filters. Using forceps, place them in parallel on the Matrigel-coated coverslips in the Medium 3-containing 35 mm dish. Reverse the spinal cord explant-mounted filter strips, and hold them with a pair of stainless metal weights (from right above, gently place the weights to stabilize the two NC strips) (Figures 1G and 1M). Now the ventricular side of the spinal cord is contacting the Matrigel-coated surface of the coverslip. Incubate the dish at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 Â°C for 48 h. In our experiments, the cultures were treated with Slit ligand (see Materials and Reagents D.10.). Usually, we do not replace media during 48 h cultivation, before performing ligand stimulation and fixation.<br/><em>Notes:</em><br/><ol class="npwfour"><li><em>During the flipping step, do not put out the explant on the medium.</em> </li><li><em>Although netrin-1 has been used to promote axon growth in dSC (-FP) explants (</em><em>e.g.</em><em>, Zou </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2000), we do not use netrin-1, irrespective of dSC (-FP) and SC (+FP) explant cultures. Thus, we have examined effects of Slit alone on Robo1 receptor expression (Kinoshita-Kawada </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2019).</em> </li></ol></li><li>Examine axon outgrowth in the explant culture under a phase-contrast microscope. Much more axons should extend from the ventral side of the explants. Under the conditions used, the axonal front should reach a distance of 500 Î¼m or more from the explant after 48 h in culture.</li><li>For ligand stimulation, we usually remove the half volume (1 ml) of the culture medium and add 1 ml of the ligand-containing fresh medium. After ligand stimulation, perform fixation of the explant cultures at room temperature for 1 h, by adding 4% PFA plus 10% sucrose in PBS. Immediately before fixation, remove the metal weights carefully. Wash the fixed explants three times with PBS each for 30-60 min, and finally add PBS + 0.025% NaN<sub>3</sub> for storage. The explants can be subjected to immunostaining. Handle with extra care not to detach the explants from the coverslip during fixation, washing and immunostaining steps.</li></ol></li><li>Immunostaining<br/>We usually perform immunostaining of the cultured explants 1 day or later after fixation, which gives better results of immunostaining for Robo receptors and L1.<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Permeabilize the cultured explants with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at room temperature.</li><li>Wash three times with PBS for 5 min each.</li><li>Block the samples with blocking buffer 1 containing 3% BSA, 0.1% skim milk and 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.</li><li>Incubate the explants with the primary antibodies that are diluted in blocking buffer 1 at 4 Â°C overnight (for approximately 18-20 h).

Spinal cords are dissected from mouse embryos after DNA injection and EP, and are cultured as âclosed-bookâ explants in collagen matrix at 37 Â°C at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 4 days (Figures 2A-2H). During this culture period, vYFP-expressing commissural axons reach, cross the ventral midline and turn longitudinally in control spinal cord preparations (Figure 2I). The effects of gene knockdown and knockout can be evaluated in terms of midline axon guidance.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Dissect out E11.5 mouse embryos into HCMF, as described above. Select the embryos appropriate for EP by performing accurate staging of mouse embryos.<br/><em>Note: It is important that the curving morphology of the neural tube of the embryos matches the shape of the electrode. In our hands, the stages just before E11.5 are appropriate for introduction of plasmids/shRNAs to pre-crossing neurons by EP and axon midline crossing in situ. E10.5-11.0 spinal cords are difficult to electroporate efficiently and to prepare the explants in subsequent steps, resulting in insufficient labeling of midline-crossing axons.</em> <br/><br/><!--video3373-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3373-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3373-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3373/3373-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.

Manually inject spinal cords of E11.5 embryos with a solution containing shRNA constructs (2 Î¼g/Î¼l) and pCAG-vYFP (0.4 Î¼g/Î¼l) supplemented with 0.05-0.1% Fast Green and diluted in DPBS (Video 1). Immediately thereafter, electroporate embryos unilaterally with three 50-ms pulses of 20 V at 50-ms intervals (for E11.5 ICR embryos) by using the NEPA21 electroporator (Nepa Gene) and forceps-type electrodes (CUY665P9-6-2-5, Nepa Gene) (Figures 2E and 2F). Just before performing EP, sandwich the injected embryo gently between two electrodes (we set the cathode left-side and the anode right-side) and press the foot switch of the NEPA21 machine. Wait until EP is finished. Do not sandwich the embryo with the electrodes too tightly during EP. If too tightly sandwiched, the injected DNA solution will leak out, and the embryo may be damaged during EP.<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>If different types of PBS are used, the actual electric conditions for EP of embryos may become dramatically different. We recommend testing several kinds of PBS for EP, in terms of gene transfer efficiency and tissue integrity. In addition, if we continue to use the same DPBS for EP of many embryos, the current flowed and electric energy tend to increase remarkably, which also affects tissue integrity. We use fresh DPBS in a new dish for every 3 embryos.</em> </li><li><em>Inject a sufficient volume of DNA solution into the cavity of the neural tube (two approaches are presented in Figure 2A), but too much volume does not increase the efficiency of gene transfer into the spinal cord, because the DNA tends to leak from the embryo after a blowout of the neural tube. EP pulses make the embryonic tissues, especially FP regions fragile. For getting the best results in EP, in terms of the location and efficiency of gene transfer, sufficient practice will be required. If the EP efficiency is too low even after practice, consider whether the shape of your electrodes matches the curving morphology of spinal cords of the embryos, and the electric condition of EP may have to be modified (efficient EP depends on the types of electrodes, pulse voltage, width, numbers and intervals as well as damping factors).</em><br/>This video shows an experiment of DNA injection into E11.5 mouse spinal cord before EP under a dissecting microscope.

Keep them on ice for recovery. After performing EP of each embryo, gently wipe the electrodes with 70% ethanol.<br/><em>Note: We found that the tissue integrity of eletroporated spinal cords is better when keeping in L-15 than in HCMF. After finishing all the EP steps, clean up the electrodes, brush them softly using a toothbrush (or a cotton swab) and toothpaste. Wash them with distilled water and finally with 70% ethanol, and let them air-dry.</em> </li><li>After EP of all the embryos are finished, transfer the embryos to fresh HCMF-containing dishes and dissect out spinal cords carefully, one-by-one. When isolating the electroporated spinal cord from the embryo, we usually start dissection from the regions near the roof plate, to avoid damaging the FP. Do not remove the meninges from the spinal cord. Prepare the closed-book explant, with the meninges attached.<br/><em>Note: We recover the electroporated spinal cords from the cervical to lumbar levels for explant culture. In our hands, successful vYFP expression in the spinal cord, robust axon extension toward the ventral region and axon midline crossing were observed usually from the upper-limbs to lower-limbs levels.</em> </li><li>Embed each isolated spinal cord in collagen gel. Before starting embedding, have acid collagen solution, 5x concentrated medium (DMEM/F12) and reconstruction buffer, and keep them on ice. Mix 7 volumes of acid collagen solution (for example, 350 Î¼l/tube, in our experiments) and 2 volumes of 5x concentrated medium (DMEM/F12) (for example, 100 Î¼l/tube) and keep on ice until use. Just before use, add approximately 0.9-1 volume of reconstruction buffer (for example, 45 Î¼l/tube) to the above mixture, mix well by pipetting and if needed, adjust pH to ~7.4 by referring to the color of phenol red included in the mixture. When kept on ice or at 4 Â°C, the collagen mixture can be maintained in the sol state for a while. When kept at 37 Â°C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, the mixture will gelatinize.</li><li>Place one spinal cord per 35 mm dish (we usually keep the FP the right side [Figure 2G], so that the electroplated side of the spinal cord is located upward). Cover a âclosed-bookâ preparation of the explant with 120 Î¼l of the sol-state collagen mixture and incubate in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator to gelatinize collagen for 15-30 min (not too long). When the collagen has gelatinized, add 2-2.5 ml of Medium 4 to the dish slowly.</li><li>Culture at 37 Â°C for 4 days (exchange daily the half volume, ~1 ml, of the medium).</li><li>After 4 days of culture, dissect out spinal cords from collagen gel. Transfer them into PBS or HCMF. Remove the meninges, cut the roof plate and prepare open-book preparations. Fix the spinal cord with 4% PFA in PBS on Sylgard-coated dissection dishes for 15 min at room temperature (for this fixation step, Sylgard-coated dishes appear to be much better than usual culture dishes). Continue fixation as immersion fixation of the spinal cord at 4 Â°C overnight. Wash the spinal cords twice with PBS and finally replace with PBS + 0.025% NaN3 for storage.<br/><em>Notes:</em><br/><ol class="npwthree"><li><em>When recovering the spinal cords from the gel, their appearance should be similar to those before cultivation, without remarkable swelling. If so different, consider the milder EP condition (</em><em>e.g.</em><em>, try fewer pulses, lower voltages). Use 4% PFA in PBS without sucrose for fixation. In the presence of sucrose in the fixative, spinal cords will be floating and damaged due to surface tension.</em> </li><li><em>We do not use collagenase to recover the spinal cords from the gel.</em> </li></ol></li><li>Mount the electroprated spinal cords for observation. Transfer the open-book spinal cord explant, together with PBS, onto a 24 x 60 mm rectangular coverslip, remove most of PBS, add PermaFluor and cover the explant with another coverslip (same size) to make a sandwich. Visualize them under a confocal microscope. We acquire confocal stacks of green-channel images for visualizing vYFP signals and DIC images to show the accurate FP position.

We usually analyze the axonal trajectories in at least 4 embryos for each experimental group (tracing approximately 200-3000 labeled axons) and perform Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunnâs post-hoc test for statistical analysis. In these analyses, no data for vYFP-positive axons were excluded, with exceptions of over-shooting axons (see below; see also Kinoshita-Kawada <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Figure 7).
