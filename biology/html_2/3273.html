            <h1>Detachment Procedure of Bacteria from Atmospheric Particles for Flow-cytometry Counting</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The protocol separates bacteria from atmospheric particles, obtaining with greater precision their abundance in the atmospheric deposition. This procedure is similar to the one used to separate bacteria in streambed sediments. The detachment procedure consists of a chemical treatment with sodium pyrophosphate and Tween 20 and a physical treatment with agitation and ultrasonic bath to disperse the bacteria in the liquid sample. We recover the total (free and attached) bacteria by generating a density gradient with Nycodenz by centrifugation. The techniques prior to this procedure do not include the microorganisms that are attached to the aerosol particles and, therefore, considerably underestimate the total load and deposition of airborne microorganisms. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The study of airborne microorganisms (bioaerosol) is relevant to understand their long-range dispersal and to assess their meteorological consequences (Kellogg and Griffin 2006; Creamean <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Airborne microorganisms, aerosolized from soil or sea surface, can be transported large distances by the global atmospheric circulation expanding their distribution ranges (Aller <em>et al.</em>, 2005; HervÃ s <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em>, 2012). They are removed from the atmosphere by wet (rain/snow) and dry deposition (sedimentation), affecting the microbial abundance, composition, and distribution in recipient ecosystems (Peter <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Reche <em>et al.</em>, 2018). In addition, bacteria in the atmosphere can act as condensation nuclei of clouds and ice affecting meteorological and climatic conditions (FrÃ¶hlich-Nowoisky <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Viruses and bacteria usually are air-dispersed attached to soil-dust or to marine organic aggregates, not as free cells or particles (Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Reche <em>et al.</em>, 2018). This protocol allows detaching bacteria and viruses from atmospheric particles to quantify them more accurately using flow cytometry (Reche <em>et al.</em>, 2018). This protocol can be relevant in the fields of microbial ecology, aerobiology, and atmospheric sciences. This procedure was inspired in another similar by Amalfitano and Fazi (2008) to detach benthic bacteria from stream sediments. <br/><br/>The detachment procedure consists of two steps: first, a chemical treatment by adding sodium pyrophosphate and Tween 20 to break the links to particles and aggregates; and a second physical treatment by shaking and incubation in an ultrasonic bath to disperse the bacteria into the liquid phase. To recover all the bacteria, we generate a density gradient with Nycodenz by centrifugation obtaining four layers (from top to bottom: supernatant, microbial layer, Nycodenz and pellet). We retrieve completely the layer with microorganisms that were suspended in sterilized Milli-Q water up to the original volume, fixed and stored at -80 Â°C until the flow cytometry analysis.</p>

It is similar to the procedure used for benthic bacteria attached to streambed sediments by Amalfitano and Fazi (2008). After this detachment procedure, bacteria are unattached, dispersed in sterile MilliQ-water and they, then, can be easily counted by flow cytometry representing the total of bacteria associated to atmospheric particles. The atmospheric samples come from dry and wet collectors. We take 3 ml-samples into 5 ml-criovials, fix them with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde (10% + 0.05% final concentration) in the field, freeze them in liquid nitrogen, and keep them at -80 Â°C until analysis. Dry deposition is recovered from the collector using sterile Milli-Q water. More details on dry and wet collectors can be found in Reche <em>et al.</em> (2018). <br/>  Here, we mainly expose the steps for the bacterial counting (Gasol and Del Giorgio, 2000), but the previous steps on the retrieve of the microbial layer are also common for viruses.</p><br/><ol class="npwone"><li>Bacteria detachment procedure<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Take 718 Î¼l of atmospheric deposition samples in 1.5 ml-microcentrifuge tubes.

The syringe with the Nycodenz should not disturb the content of the microcentrifuge tube or has air bubbles.

The pellet is not always visible. The observation of the pellet depends on particle loading in the atmospheric deposition and it is mainly observed when atmospheric deposition contains Saharan dust.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="111" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617183338_2081.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.
