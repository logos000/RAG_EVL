            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cardiac pacemaker cells of the sino-atrial node are responsible for the initiation of the heart beat and express an array of ion channels. The patch-clamp technique is the gold standard method for investigating the function of ion channels expressed in electrically active cells. Conventional whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp techniques can be used to investigate ionic currents in the voltage-clamp mode and changes in membrane potential (<em>e.g.</em>, action potential) in the current-clamp mode. Here, we provide details of protocols used to measure spontaneous and triggered action potentials and whole-cell funny current If (HCN4) in single cardiomyocytes isolated from the mouse sino-atrial node (SAN).</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The patch-clamp technique allows for the real-time measurement of ionic currents and membrane potential from electrically active cells (Hamill <em>et al.</em>, 1981). Electrically active SAN cells are also known as pacemaker cells as they initiate the beating of the heart. The automaticity of the SAN is in part due to the slow diastolic depolarization of the membrane initiated by the opening of If (HCN4) allowing the membrane potential to reach threshold and leading to firing of the SAN action potential. The If current (also known as the pacemaker current) is a non-selective sodium/potassium current activated at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and by intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Whole-cell voltage-clamp and current-clamp recordings allow for understanding of the role of various ionic currents underlying the SAN action potential in more details (Aziz <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Nobles <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Patch-clamp of isolated SAN cells can be challenging, here we provide detailed protocols for the measurement of ionic currents and action potentials using conventional and perforated whole-cell patch-clamp techniques.</p>

For perforated patch-clamp, pipette resistance is around 1.3-1.6 MÎ©.<br/><em>Note: The heat settings for the pipette puller need to be optimized for the required resistance. This will be different for individual machines, however as an example, we set our pipette puller (PP-830, Narashige) to 62 Â°C (1<sup>st</sup> pull) and 48 Â°C (2<sup>nd</sup> pull) for whole-cell patch pipettes (with filament) and to 6 Â°C (1<sup>st</sup> pull) and 43 Â°C (2<sup>nd</sup> pull) for perforated-patch pipettes (without filament). The second pull is important for the shape and size of the pipette.</em> </li><li>Take a coverslip from the plate using curved forceps and place it, cell side up, into the patch-clamp chamber. Perfuse the cells continuously with extracellular solution (most patch-clamp rigs have gravity-driven perfusion systems on them to allow continuous perfusion of solutions during experiments).</li><li>Fill the pipette with the relevant intracellular solution (~half-full using a 1 ml syringe attached to a microloader pipette tip) and remove any air bubbles by gently flicking the pipette before placing it on the pipette holder. For perforated patch-clamp, first fill the tip of the pipette with amphotericin-free intracellular solution by carefully dipping the tip in this solution for a few seconds, then back fill the pipette with stock solution containing amphotericin (Recipe 2).<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>It is very important to remove any air bubbles so as not to compromise whole-cell access resistance and current/membrane potential measurements.</em> </li><li><em>It is advantageous to use non-filamented glass capillaries for perforated patch because it allows one to fill the end of the tip of the pipette with amphotericin-free solution, this helps with seal formation by delaying perforation. The time for âdippingâ the tip (to fill the tip with amphotericin-free solution) is important as it can influence the time taken to perforate the cellâthis time must be optimized. In general, we âdipâ the tip for 2 s initially and see how that affects seal formation and perforation. If seal formation is difficult or the cell starts to perforate before seal formation then a longer âdippingâ time is required.</em> </li></ol></li><li>Lower the pipette into the bath solution using the micromanipulator. After compensating for pipette offset (using the patch-clamp amplifier), under the microscope, approach and gently touch the chosen cell with the pipette to form a high resistance Giga-Ohm (Gâ¦) seal using negative pressure (suction).</li><li>For perforated patch, wait until the access resistance (Ra) reaches at least 20 MÎ© (this depends on the efficacy of the amphotericin). For the whole-cell configuration apply more negative pressure to achieve whole-cell access. Ra should be below 10 Mâ¦. In both configurations, compensate for whole-cell capacitance and series resistance (70-80%) using the patch-clamp amplifier (this has in-built circuitry to compensate for both parameters). Note the whole-cell capacitance (Cm) for each cell.</li><li>For acquisition, set the filter at 2 kHz and sampling rate at 10 kHz.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Whole-cell funny current (If) measurements using the perforated patch-clamp technique<ol class="npwtwo"><li>To record whole-cell If currents from SAN cells, the amplifier should be set to voltage-clamp mode (this is done via a switch on the amplifier interface).</li><li>The following solutions allow for detection and measurement of the If current: Perforated-Patch intracellular solution and Tyrode extracellular solution (Recipe 1).</li><li>Acquire If current-voltage relationship using the following step protocol (see Figure 1): Hold the cell at a holding potential of -40 mV.

The frequency of the trigger can be set as desired.

Further analysis can be carried out using MS Excel, Microcal Origin and GraphPad Prism.</li><li>For voltage-clamp recordings (see Nobles <em>et al.</em>, 2018), plotting the voltage at each step (x) vs current amplitude (y) gives a current (I)-voltage (V) relationship (see Figure 1). The current amplitude can be normalized to cell size by using the Cm. From the I-V relationship is it possible to assess changes in the activation profile and voltage-dependence when the cell is challenged pharmacologically for example. Ideally, cells isolated from at least 5 mice should be subjected to patch-clamp recordings. More information can be ascertained from the raw current traces. For example, time course and rate of activation and inactivation.</li><li>Action potential measurements from current-clamp recordings can initially be analyzed using the event detection function on Clampfit (analysis module from the pCLAMP software), this measures beating frequency, action potential amplitude, inter-event intervals and variability. This can also be done manually on Clampfit for quality control. In addition, parameters such as resting membrane potential (RMP), maximum diastolic potential (MDP), peak potential, time to peak and action potential duration (APD), action potential duration at 50% and 90% amplitude (APD50 and APD90, respectively). Additional AP durations, for example at 20%, 30% <em>etc.</em> amplitudes can also be calculated. Upstroke velocity can be calculated from action potential amplitude and time-to-peak (action potential amplitude (mV)/time-to-peak (ms)).
