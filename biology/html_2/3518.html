            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Yeasts such as <em>Aureobasidium pullulans</em> are unicellular fungi that occur in all environments and play important roles in biotechnology, medicine, food and beverage production, research, and agriculture. In the latter, yeasts are explored as biocontrol agents for the control of plant pathogenic fungi (<em>e.g.</em>, <em>Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium</em> sp.); mainly on flowers and fruits. Eventually, such yeasts must be evaluated under field conditions, but such trials require a lot of time and resources and are often difficult to control. Experimental systems of intermediate complexity, between <em>in vitro</em> Petri dish assays and field trials, are thus required. For pre- and post-harvest applications, competition assays on fruits are reproducible, economical and thus widely used. Here, we present a general protocol for competition assays with fruits that can be adapted depending on the biocontrol yeast, plant pathogen, type of assay or fruit to be studied.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Biocontrol, the use of organisms to control plant pathogens, pests, and weeds, is an attractive alternative to conventional plant protection methods and can help reduce the amount of chemical pesticides employed in agriculture. Most biocontrol organisms are first evaluated <em>in vitro</em>, under laboratory conditions, but eventually will have to prove their efficacy in extensive field trials over many years. Experimental systems which more closely resemble the conditions of an eventual application than a Petri dish and are at the same time, more defined and less time- and resource-demanding than a field trial, are therefore required for both research and the development of novel biocontrol applications.<br/><br/>The bio-protocol presented here represents a combination and adaptation of earlier methods and is specifically aimed at testing the antagonistic activity of yeasts against postharvest diseases of different fruits. Such assays have for example been used to test for antagonistic activity of various yeasts in oranges (Ferraz <em>et al.</em>, 2016), cherries (Oro <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Gore-Lloyd <em>et al.</em>, 2019), peach (Grzegorczyk <em>et al.</em>, 2017), nectarines (Janisiewicz <em>et al.</em>, 2010), plums (Janisiewicz <em>et al.</em>, 2014), pears (Lutz <em>et al.</em>, 2012), grapes (Parafati <em>et al.</em>, 2015) and apples (Vero <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Apart from antagonism testing, a similar method has also been used to assess postharvest disease resistance of apples (Norelli <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The protocol can also be adapted for testing the combined application of biocontrol yeasts with antifungal agents, formulation compounds, plant resistance inducers, or other additives that are envisioned to improve biocontrol efficacy (El-Ghaouth <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Yu and Zheng, 2006; Yan <em>et al.</em>, 2014). The method presented here is thus easily reproducible, efficient and extensively adaptable for testing and evaluating disease control in a variety of fruits.</p>
