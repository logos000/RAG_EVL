            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Ascidians are the closest living relatives of vertebrates (Delsuc <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Satoh <em>et al.</em>, 2014) and are important for the evolutionary study of the ovarian follicle development including oocyte maturation and ovulation. However, neither the endogenous factors nor the molecular mechanisms underlying the oocyte maturation and ovulation had been elucidated mainly due to the lack of efficient procedure for isolating ovarian follicles. Here, we present the protocol for the effective fractionation and isolation of the ovarian follicle of <em>Ciona intestinalis</em> type A using stainless steel sieves with various particle size-meshes, and the simple incubation method of <em>Ciona</em> follicles for evaluating oocyte maturation and ovulation. Combined with the RNA-seq data from each fraction, the current methods lead us to investigate ovarian follicle development including oocyte maturation and ovulation in a stage-specific manner.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><em>Ciona</em> ovarian follicles are classified into four major developmental stages: stage I (pre-vitellogenic), stage II (vitellogenic), stage III (post-vitellogenic, pre-GVBD), and stage IV (post-GVBD, ovulated) follicles (Figure 1; Prodon <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Silvestre <em>et al.</em>, 2009). The ovary of adult ascidians contains numerous follicles at entire developmental stages, and thus, isolation of individual follicles at specific stage is time-consuming and troublesome. This hindered functional analyses in follicular development and suggests requirement for efficient method of follicle isolation. Here we provide an effective fractionation method that a mixture of every developmental stage of follicles can be fractionated using a series of stainless steel sieves with various particle-size meshes (20-150 Î¼m). The current fractionation method enables us to isolate the entire developmental stages of follicles easily and quickly. Moreover, oocyte maturation and ovulation can be evaluated by germinal vesicle breakdown (<em>i.e.</em> GVBD) and rupture of follicular cell layer, respectively (Figure 1). Therefore, a simple incubation method of immature/pre-ovulatory follicle is useful for elucidating the endogenous regulator and the underlying molecular mechanisms oocyte maturation and ovulation as in Matsubara <em>et al.</em>, 2019. Furthermore, transcriptomic data of the entire developmental stages of <em>Ciona</em> follicles, combined with fractionation of respective developmental-stage follicles, lead to the comprehensive understanding of not only oocyte maturation and ovulation but also the entire developmental mechanisms of <em>Ciona</em> follicles. The present fractionation and culture systems are also expected to be applicable to follicles of other aquatic animals including jellyfish, starfish, sea urchin and fish, and will contribute a great deal to advances in the study on oocyte maturation and ovulation in various organisms.</p>

Developmental stages of <em>Ciona</em> ovarian follicles.</strong> Immature/pre-ovulatory (stage I-III) follicles show a germinal vesicle (GV, black arrow) and are enveloped by follicular cells and outer follicular cell (OFc) layer (white arrow).
