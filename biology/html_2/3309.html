            <h1>Lipid-exchange Rate Assay for Lipid Droplet Fusion in Live Cells</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jia Wang, Boon Tin Chua, Peng Li, Feng-Jung Chen</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are central organelles in maintaining lipid homeostasis. Defective LD growth often results in the development of metabolic disorders. LD fusion and growth mediated by cell deathâinducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha (DFFA)-like effector (CIDE) family proteins are crucial for various biological processes including unilocular LD formation in the adipocytes, lipid storage in the liver, milk lipid secretion in the mammary epithelia cells, and lipid secretion in the skin sebocytes. Previous methodology by Gong <em>et al.</em> (2011) first reported a lipid-exchange rate assay to evaluate the fusion ability of each LD pair in the cells mediated by CIDE family proteins and their regulators, but photobleaching issue remains a problem and a detailed procedure was not provided. Here, we provide an improved and detailed protocol for the lipid-exchange rate measurement. The three key steps for this assay are cell preparation, image acquisition, and data analysis. The images of the fluorescence recovery are acquired after photobleaching followed by the measurement of the intensity changes in the LD pair. The difference in fluorescent intensity is used to obtain the lipid exchange rate between the LDs. The accuracy and repetitiveness of the calculated exchange rates are assured with three-cycle of photobleaching process and the linear criteria in data fitting. With this quantitative assay, we are able to identify the functional roles of the key proteins and the effects of their mutants on LD fusion. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Lipid droplets (LDs) play a key role in maintaining lipid homeostasis (Farese and Walther, 2009; Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Defective LD maturation and growth are closely associated with the development of metabolic diseases such as obesity, fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and type II diabetes (Krahmer <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014; Gluchowski <em>et al.</em>, 2017). LDs are dynamic organelles which budded from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Gross <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Choudhary <em>et al.</em>, 2015) and continue to grow via triglyceride synthesis and lipid transfer from the ER (Fujimoto <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Wilfling <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Xu <em>et al.</em>, 2018) or LD fusion (Gong <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Somwar <em>et al.</em>, 2011). LD-associated cell deathâinducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector (CIDE) family proteins including CIDEA, CIDEB, and CIDEC/Fsp27 (Gao <em>et al.</em>, 2017) are crucial regulators in the lipid homeostasis by governing atypical LD fusion and growth for lipid storage. Previously, we reported that CIDEC mediates LD fusion through directional lipid transfer from small (donor) to large (acceptor) LDs (Gong <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Somwar <em>et al.</em>). The enrichment of CIDEC at the LD-LD contact site (LDCS) and the formation of the fusion pore are two essential steps for lipid exchange and transfer to occur. To evaluate the fusion ability of each LD pair in cells mediated by the CIDE family proteins and their regulators such as Perilipin1 (Sun <em>et al.</em>, 2013a) or Rab8a (Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2014), lipid-exchange rate assay was first proposed and performed as previously described (Gong <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Sun <em>et al.</em>, 2013b). However, the analytic process reported in the previous methodology neither eliminated the photobleaching effect upon laser exposure nor provided a detailed procedure to ensure experimental reproducibility and accuracy. <br/><br/>Here, we detailed the protocol of our renewed lipid-exchange rate assay used in Wang <em>et al.</em> (2018). The three key steps in the assay including cell preparation, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) image acquisition, and data analysis using mean of intensities (MOI) and BODIPY-C12-stained size measurement of LDs were reported. Upon performing a three-cycle photobleaching process and the pre-estimation of exchange rate based on the linear criteria in the data analysis, we can ensure the accuracy and repetitiveness of the fitted exchange rates by using our proposed equation underlying molecular thermodynamics in the Theory section. This lipid-exchange rate assay is also applicable for the evaluation of a nanometer size channel connecting two vesicles when the micrometer volumes of the vesicles are measured in advance.<br/></p>

During LD fusion, the lipids constantly exchange between the two LDs. For the measurement of the lipid-exchange rates between the LDs in live cells, the small (donor) LD of each LD pair pre-stained with BODIPY-C12 was photobleached. The fluorescence-labeled lipids in the large (acceptor) LD diffused into the small LD, and the photobleached lipids went into the large LD. The images of the small and large (acceptor) LDs, before and after photobleaching, were recorded and their fluorescent intensities were normalized to the initial fluorescent intensity of the large LD at time 0 s after photobleaching, giving rise to the initial intensity ratio of 1 for the large LD. The ratio of fluorescent intensity of the photobleached small LD to the large LD at time 0 s is denoted as <em>G</em><sub>0</sub>. At any time after photobleaching, the time-dependent ratios of the fluorescent intensities of the large and small LDs are denoted as <em>G</em><sub>1</sub> (<em>t</em>) and <em>G</em><sub>2</sub> (<em>t</em>), respectively. Therefore, a time-invariable exchange rate (â<sub>e</sub>) of the neutral lipid molecules between an LD pair is calculated from the measurement of the fluorescence recovering rate in the LD pair according to the ordinary differential equation as follows:<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="94" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190712/20190712065305_0761.jpg" width="230"/><br/><br/>where <em>V<sub>1</sub> </em>and <em>V<sub>2</sub> </em>represent the volumes of the large and small LDs, respectively. The unit of the lipid-exchange rate is Î¼m<sup>3</sup>/s.

Next, place the culture dish with the cells in the incubator for 1 h before FRAP experiments to help the cells accommodate to the changed medium.</li></ol><br/></li><li>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) image acquisition<br/>The module of FRAP is conventional in most commercial confocal microscopes. Here, we used a Nikon A1 confocal microscope to perform FRAP measurements as an example. This following procedures can also be used for FRAP experiments when using the other confocal microscopes.<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Turn on the live cell station, set the temperature to 37 Â°C, switch on the 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, add an appropriate amount of double distilled water in a heating trough.</li><li>Turn on the confocal microscope, laser generator, microscope controller, mercury lamp, electric automatic stage, z-axis piezoelectric stage, and computer workstation. Turn on the perfect focus system (PFS). Launch the Nis-element software. Choose the 100x oil-immersion objective (Numerical aperture 1.45). Add objective oil dropwise onto the objective, place the 35 mm glass bottom culture dish onto the sample holder, and adjust the height of the objective to immerse the culture dish in the oil. Allow the cells to accommodate for 1 h if possible, or at least 0.5 h to ensure the stability of the following measurement.</li><li>Set the parameters of the microscope as shown in Figure 2. Click on the channel button, select âFluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)â and âTetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)â channels. Choose ânoneâ in Channel series. To capture the fluorescent images, fine settings of the optimized laser power and the gain and sensitivity of detector are critical. There are several commercial microscopes but their definitions of the setting parameters are different. Here, we used Nikon A1 confocal microscope as an example to show our settings, in which âLaser powerâ indicates the level of real laser power, âHVâ indicates the gain of detector (brightness of images), and âOffsetâ indicates the sensitivity of detector (contrast of images). Thus, set the FITC laser power to â6.0â, HV â60-120â, off set â0â; the TRITC laser â0.3â, HV â60-120â, off set â0â. Set pinhole as home under the wavelength of 561 nm. Set scan size to â512 x 512 pixelsâ, scan speed â1 frame/sâ, zoom â3.0â, and line average ânoneâ.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="178" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190712/20190712065536_1085.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

In Phase 1, choose âAcquisitionâ in Acq/Stim, âNo delayâ in Interval, a duration of 1.06 s and 1 loop to capture one image, which shows the initial fluorescent intensities of an LD pair before photobleaching. In Phase 2 and Phase 3, set 3x in Group option. In addition, in Phase 2, set âStimulationâ in Acq/Sim, âS1â in ROIs and 1 loop to perform photobleaching. The stimulation duration will be automatically set according to the setting of stimulation scanning speed in Figure 3. In Phase 3, choose âAcquisitionâ in Acq/Stim, â1.06 sâ in time Interval, and 30 (fast exchange rate) or 50 (slow exchange rate) loops to capture time-lapse images with a time interval of 1.06 s, which record the change in the fluorescent intensities of the LD pair after photobleaching. Subsequently, the duration is automatically calculated. Choose âPerform Time Measurementâ.

Next, draw another circle at the center of the donor LD that covers about 70% area of the donor LD; Draw a third circle at the center of the acceptor LD that covers about 70% area of the acceptor LD. The reason for selecting 70% area is dependent on our experience with the optimal HV value and bleaching laser power used. It is possible to adjust the percentage area on case by case basis.

But, in view of the other to-be-measured LD pairs maybe of different sizes and fluorescent intensities, as well as the potential limitation of the custom-built LabVIEW program to handle any condition of FRAP data, we also provide the manual method to process the most difficult cases.

Briefly, because there are more fluorescent molecules in the larger LDs, photobleaching these large LDs more than twice will result in the rapid decline of the fluorescent intensities in the LD pair and pose difficulty in the fluorescence recovery detection.</li><li>The most critical step in this protocol is to obtain the optimal linearity (mse) and repetitiveness (%) of three fitted lines as described in âProcedure Câ. If either the evaluated linearity or the repetitiveness of the fitted lines in the three cycles measured is out of the linear criteria, the data set should be discarded as these indicate that the exchange rate event might be unstable during the acquisition interval. These unstable exchange rates possibly resulted from the physical size change of the LD pair, the height of imaging plane, deformation of LD fusion complex, and serious photobleaching <em>et al.</em> We recommend 50 sets or more of the lipid-exchange rates to be measured. In general, 30-40 events of lipid-exchange is sufficient to satisfy the criteria if acquired under an optimal environmental control condition.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28527">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Mix 1.37 M NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 8 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 14.7 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 9 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in 900 ml deionized H<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>Adjust to a final pH of 7.4</li><li>Add deionized H<sub>2</sub>O to 1,000 ml</li><li>Autoclave to store (This is 10x PBS stock)</li><li>Dilute PBS stock with deionized H<sub>2</sub>O to 1x PBS</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28528">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">We thank the members of P.
