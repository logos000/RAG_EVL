            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Every living cell relies on signal transduction pathways comprised of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In many cases, these PPIs are between a folded protein domain and a short linear motif (SLiM) within an unstructured region of a protein. As a result of this small interaction interface (3-10 amino acids), the affinities of SLiM-mediated interactions are typically weak (<em>K</em><sub>d</sub>s of ~1-10 ÂµM), allowing physiologically relevant changes in cellular concentrations of either protein partner to dictate changes in occupancy and thereby transmit cellular signals. However, these weak affinities also render detection and quantitative measurement of these interactions challenging and labor intensive. To address this, we recently developed MRBLE-pep, a technology that employs peptide libraries synthesized on spectrally encoded hydrogel beads to allow multiplexed affinity measurements between a protein and many different peptides in parallel. This approach dramatically reduces both the amount of protein and peptide as well as the time required to measure protein-peptide affinities compared to traditional methods. Here, we provide a detailed protocol describing how to: (1) functionalize polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEG-DA) MRBLE beads with free amine groups, (2) synthesize peptide libraries on functionalized MRBLEs, (3) validate synthesized peptide sequences via MALDI mass spectrometry and quantify evenness of peptide coverage on MRBLEs, (4) use MRBLE-bound peptide libraries in multiplexed protein binding assays, and (5) analyze binding data to determine binding affinities. We anticipate that this protocol should prove useful for other researchers seeking to use MRBLE-pep in their own laboratories as well as for researchers broadly interested in solid-phase peptide synthesis and protein-protein binding assay development.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Cellular signal transduction pathways rely on protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The majority of these interactions are mediated by short linear motifs (SLiM) in disordered regions of proteins and a globular domain on another protein (Neduva and Russell, 2006; Dinkel <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Low affinities and prevalent regulation by post-translation modifications have left this type of interaction relatively unexplored. Screening methods like yeast-2-Hybrid (Y2H), phage display (PD) and protein microarrays (PMA) have proven successful for identifying SLiM-based interactions (Mu <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Meyer <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Ueki <em>et al.</em>, 2019); however, they do not return quantitative information about binding affinities. In addition, these methods cannot report negative information (<em>e.g.</em>, mutations that ablate PPIs) and in Y2H and PD do not easily allow incorporation of modified or unnatural amino acids. Conversely, current methods designed specifically to measure binding affinities, such as ITC, SPR and fluorescence polarization, are low throughput and require large amounts of reagents (Fodor <em>et al.</em>, 1991; Gfeller <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Zhou, 2012; Tinti <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Ivarsson and Jemth, 2019). An ideal workflow for identification and characterization of SLiM-based interactions would allow both high-throughput identification of interesting PPIs and medium-throughput characterization of their binding affinities.<br/><br/>The recently published MRBLE-pep technology allows the measurement of binding affinities for many peptides in parallel, thereby facilitating protein-SLiM interaction characterization (Nguyen <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In line with one-bead-one-compound libraries, the method synthesizes peptides directly on beads via solid-phase peptide synthesis to generate one-code-one-peptide libraries (Lam <em>et al.</em>, 1991 and 1997; Nguyen <em>et al.</em>, 2016, 2017 and 2019). However, unlike standard one-bead-one-compound libraries which require downstream isolation of bound beads and either mass spectrometry, Edman degradation or sequencing to identify bound analytes of interest, MRBLE-pep relies on libraries of peptides synthesized directly on spectrally encoded beads with a 1:1 relationship between the sequence of the displayed peptide and the embedded spectral codes (Brown <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2011; MacConnell <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Nguyen <em>et al.</em>, 2019). These spectrally encoded beads (MRBLEs, for Microspheres with Ratiometric Barcode Lanthanide Encoding) are generated by embedding lanthanide nanoparticles (LNP) ratiometrically into polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEG-DA), as described previously. Each LNP species emits light in a series of narrow and well-separated spectral bands upon excitation with deep UV light, allowing codes to be read out by imaging beads at ~9 different wavelengths and using linear unmixing to determine the ratiometric combination of LNP concentrations most likely to have produced the observed spectra and thus the embedded spectral code (Gerver <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Nguyen <em>et al.</em>, 2016 and 2017; Harink <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>Bead-based assays are extremely useful for multiplexed measurements of protein-peptide affinities and have the potential to directly quantify affinities using small amounts of material. However, successful binding assays depend critically on considerations of reagent concentration, binding equilibria and detection of the binding partners. Moreover, it is essential that binding assays take place at appropriate concentrations. Therefore, high-quality measurements depend critically on a variety of additional technical details, including robust and even functionalization of beads, gentle yet thorough mixing of beads during functionalization and binding assays, careful consideration of peptide density at the bead surface, and the number of beads added to each reaction. Here, we provide a detailed protocol describing best practices for: (1) functionalization of MRBLEs prior to peptide synthesis, (2) solid-phase peptide synthesis directly on functionalized MRBLEs, (3) peptide sequence validation and peptide density measurements, (4) MRBLE-pep protein binding assays, and (5) data analysis. While these results are presented here in the context of the MRBLE-pep assay, we anticipate that this detailed protocol may provide useful information for researchers optimizing any bead-bound binding assay.<br/></p>

Therefore, 1 equivalent ~50 mg ~0.016 mmol.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701085747_7474.jpg" width="116"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Overview of MRBLE functionalization.</strong> PEG-DA beads are functionalized with free amine groups for subsequent solid-phase peptide synthesis via Michael addition. The outer shell and inner core are differentially functionalized with acid-labile and acid-sensitive linkers by sequential immersion in water and solvents. The acid labile Rink amide linker at the inner core is thus cleaved during final amino acid side chain deprotection, allowing collection of eluted peptides for quality control and validation via mass spectrometry. The linker in the outer shell stays attached to the bead and is used for downstream measurement of protein-peptide interactions in MRBLE-pep assays.<br/><br/><strong>Part I: Production of MRBLEs</strong><br/><br/>Prior to the start of the protocol, produce PEG-DA hydrogel beads using either a multilayer PDMS âbead synthesisâ microfluidic device (as described previously [Gerver <em>et al.</em>, 2012]) or using syringe pumps and standard droplet generators.<br/>Preparation after bead synthesis:</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Transfer MRBLEs containing each spectral code (here, a 48-code library) into 48 x 2 ml reactor vessels placed in a U-Block Reactor mounted in a vacuum manifold for easy bead washing without bead loss (Figure 2 and see Notes).</li><li>Wash MRBLEs by placing U-Block Reactor assemblies onto the manifold and sequentially washing 3 x with Dichlomethane (DCM), 3 x with Methanol (MeOH), and 3 x with Dimethylformamide (DMF).

The head can be exchanged in case it is necessary to keep the content of each tube separate (see Figure 6). Wash solutions are added using a repeater. Liquid from all 48 tubes is pushed into waste bottle. This set up can be replaced by an alternate configuration; however, it makes the multiple wash steps both more convenient and more reproducible between runs.<br/><br/><strong>Part II: Functionalization of MRBLEs</strong><br/><br/>Prior to peptide synthesis, the PEG-DA polymers that make up MRBLEs hydrogel beads must be chemically functionalized with free amine groups to allow direct coupling of Fmoc-protected amino acid building blocks. In this protocol, the outer shell of the MRBLEs is selectively functionalized with an acid-resistant linker (which remains intact upon exposure to the TFA required for final side chain deprotection during Fmoc peptide synthesis) while the inner core is selectively functionalized with an acid-labile linker that is cleaved upon exposure to TFA (Kunys <em>et al.</em>, 2012). In this manner, peptides from the inner core can be eluted during the final steps of peptide synthesis for direct analysis via mass spectrometry while peptides coupled to the outer shell remain attached for downstream binding assays. This procedure takes place in 5 main steps: (A) Michael addition, (B) selective functionalization of the outer shell, (C) selective functionalization of the inner core, (D) capping of any remaining free amino groups, and (E) addition of a glycine residue to all uncapped functional groups to allow downstream couplings in peptide synthesis.</p><ol class="npwone"><li>Michael Addition to add amine functional groups to acrylate groups on PEG-DA beads using cysteamine and pyridine (Reaction 1)<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701085929_1384.png"/><br/><strong>Reaction 1.

Given that peptides are displayed on beads in the MRBLE-pep assay, this means that beads from each code are all approximately the same size, that equal numbers of beads are added to each assay, and that the surface density of displayed peptides is approximately constant. While microfluidically-produced MRBLE beads are significantly more monodisperse than most commercially available bead-based resins, care must be taken to ensure that each peptide sequence is displayed at approximately the same density. To directly visualize synthesized peptide density (and estimate peptide loading per bead), we biotinylate peptides to allow visualization using fluorescently labeled streptavidin via the following steps: (1) biotinylate the peptides after synthesis, (2) detect the biotinylated peptides using fluorescently labeled streptavidin and (3) decode the beads and measure fluorescence intensities (Figure 5). Importantly, this step can be performed at any point in the synthesis protocol to allow troubleshooting of individual steps (<em>e.g.</em>, after initial MRBLE functionalization or after particularly challenging coupling steps). In all cases, comparing fluorescence signals after a given protocol with appropriate negative controls can test that streptavidin binding is specific.</p><br/><ol class="npwone"><li>Biotinylation of MRBLE-bound peptides.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Take out about 10% of beads from each code and pool them in a new reaction vessel (<em>e.g.</em>, draw 40 Âµl out of 400 Âµl after vigorous pipetting).</li><li>Deprotect MRBLE-bound peptides with 400 Âµl 20% 4-Methylpiperidine in DMF for 10 min rotating at 20 rpm.</li><li>Prepare deprotection solution by adding the following to 800 Âµl of DMF and add all to the beads:<br/>10 eq Biotin (39 mg)<br/>10 eq DIC (24 Âµl)<br/>20 eq DIPEA (56 Âµl)</li><li>Rotate at room temperature for at least 16 hours at 20 rpm.</li><li>Drain liquid and repeat Steps G3-G4 with fresh solution.</li><li>Deprotect as described (see <strong>Part V: Peptide side chain deprotection</strong>).<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Binding Assay with Streptavidin Dylight 650<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Take out ~5,000 beads in PBS-T (wash thoroughly when stored in DMF) and block with 100 Âµl 5% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature on rotator at 20 rpm.

In addition, quality control of synthesized peptides is especially important when peptides are synthesized directly on beads subsequently used for binding experiments since chromatographic purification steps are not possible. Here, we describe analysis of eluted peptides via mass spectrometry. We use MALDI-TOF for peptide analysis, as it has a high sensitivity and generates mostly single charged ionized peptides species that make downstream identification simple (Nadler <em>et al.</em>, 2017).

MALDI ionization mostly generates single charged ions, simplifying interpretation of measured spectra. The glycine added before solid phase peptide synthesis is not necessarily visible and you might see variations of your molecular weight from salt or other impurities. To interpret more complex spectra, consider possible truncations resulting from elimination of the first or last amino acid (where synthesis efficiencies might be lower). We recommend a useful MS mass adduct calculator published by the Fiehn lab at UC Davis (<a href="https://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/staff/kind/Metabolomics/MS-Adduct-Calculator" target="_blank">https://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/staff/kind/Metabolomics/MS-Adduct-Calculator</a>) (Huang <em>et al.</em>, 1999).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701090845_4830.jpg" width="175"/><br/><strong>Figure 8.

MRBLE-pep allows multiplexed measurement of binding affinities between 48 peptides and a protein of interest using only 4 ÂµM of protein in a 100 Âµl volume, thus requiring a total of 40 Âµg of a 100 kDa protein per assay. However, several parameters must be considered carefully to ensure a successful binding experiment.</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>The number of beads added per code must be held constant within and between experiments. Empirically, we find that ~100 beads per code ensures that the concentration of available peptide is sufficiently low relative to the concentration of available protein while simultaneously reducing variability due to stochastic Poisson error in the number of beads present in each volume. In addition, having 100 replicates of each measurement allows robust detection of small but statistically significant differences in binding between peptides via signal averaging.</li><li>Accurate quantification of binding requires that bound protein be detected via imaging. In past MRBLE-pep experiments, we detected binding of epitope-tagged proteins using an antibody (Nguyen <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Here, we describe quantitation of binding for proteins that are directly tagged with a fluorescent indicator, <em>e.g.</em>, YFP. In general, any tagging strategy can be used as long as appropriate negative controls are included to eliminate spurious fluorescence that derives from non-specific interactions. For binding assays using fluorescent protein tags, an appropriate negative control should include the fluorescent protein alone. When using fluorescently labeled antibodies, binding assays should: (1) incubate the protein of interest 1:1 with antibody prior to incubation with beads to reduce direct binding of free labeled antibody to beads, and (2) directly measure binding of the labeled antibody alone to peptide-bead libraries.</li><li>The amount of protein added should include a concentration range that is 10-fold higher and lower than the expected interaction <em>K</em><sub>d</sub> whenever possible. We typically use a range of protein concentrations spanning from ~30 nM to 2 ÂµM. However, this may need to be adjusted depending on expected affinities or the presence of protein aggregation at high concentrations.</li><li>Recovering quantitative absolute and relative binding affinities requires that interactions be measured at thermodynamic equilibrium. The use of hydrogel beads results in slow association and dissociation kinetics, facilitating measurement of even weak and transient interactions difficult to detect via other methods. However, accurate affinity measurements require initial experiments to ensure that the reaction has come to equilibrium. This can be accomplished by initially monitoring protein association and dissociation rates as a function of time and then using these incubation times in all downstream experiments.<br/><br/></li></ol><ol class="npwone"><li>Binding assay for multiplexed measurement of protein-peptide affinities, using the calcineurin phosphatase tagged with YFP as an example<br/><em>Note: Calcineurin-YFP was expressed and purified from E. coli as described in Nguyen <em>et al.</em> (2019).</em> <ol class="npwtwo"><li>For each experiment, use ~100 beads per code. In the protocol described here, this corresponds to ~1% of the beads from each code (<em>e.g.</em>, if beads of 1 code are resuspended in 1 ml of buffer, draw up 10 Âµl of beads after extensive mixing). In typical assays, this means measurements take place on ~4,800 beads for 48 codes in a total volume of 20 Âµl.</li><li>Spin down beads, remove PBS-T and block to prevent excess nonspecific binding by incubating with 100 Âµl 5% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h rotating at room temperature at 20 rpm.</li><li>Wash beads once with 100 Âµl PBS-T by centrifuging beads (200 <em>x g</em>, 10 s), discarding the supernatant and adding fresh PBS-T.</li><li>Use 100 Âµl binding buffer with protein and add to beads after removing PBS-T.</li><li>When measuring a dilution series, ensure that the final concentration of all components in the final binding assay remain constant for each protein. Differences in the concentration of crowding agents (<em>e.g.</em>, glycerol) can change diffusion kinetics; similarly, differences in salt concentrations can change electrostatic interactions between proteins and peptides. Take care to consider all components of the buffer in which your purified protein and/or antibodies are dissolved.</li><li>Incubate beads for 6 h (time it takes to reach equilibrium should be determined experimentally, since it varies for each protein) with protein at indicated concentrations in binding buffer at 4 Â°C while rotating at 20 rpm.</li><li>If protein detections are performed using indirect labeling, <em>i.e.</em>, fluorescently labeled antibodies, antibody and protein must be preincubated and then added to the beads.

Here, we used an YFP filter cube (Semrock, Rochester) to detect YFP-tagged Calcineurin and a Cy5 filter cube (Semrock, Rochester) to detect Dylight 650 tagged Streptavidin.</li><li>Images were analyzed using the Python code available for download on Github (Harink <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The images were loaded into the software analysis package and then processed to decode beads and obtain fluorescence intensities for each bead and each code. The Excel table was saved and used to further process and plot the data with Python (Figure 9).</li><li>We used Python to plot the mean background subtracted fluorescence intensities for indicated peptides as well as fit the Langmuir isotherm (Figure 10).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200701/20200701090924_0482.jpg" width="78"/><br/><strong>Figure 9.

Concentration-dependent binding measurements and Langmuir isotherm fits for Calcineurin-YFP binding to 2 peptides from the 16-sequence MRBLE-pep library shown in Figure 9.</strong> Median background-subtracted fluorescence intensities for all beads with each code displaying a given peptide sequence are shown as light red dots; associated lines show Langmuir isotherm fits used to extract binding affinities. Dark red dots and lines indicate median bead intensities measured across all 3 codes and associated Langmuir isotherm fit to these median values. The left plot shows curves for a known calcineurin substrate (PRIIIT, <em>K</em><sub>d</sub> = 1.67 Â± 0.86 ÂµM calculated as the mean Â± standard deviation of the returned values from each code using a global fit); the right plot shows curves for a negative control peptide.</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti37741">### Notes</p><p class="ppzz">We use 48 x 2 ml reaction vessels and a U-Block reactor equipment, which are directly compatible with the Syro II peptide synthesizer used for high-throughput peptide synthesis. However, this protocol can be adapted to any reaction vessels and mounting plates. The reaction vessels are simple columns with a filter. The U-Block holds the reaction vessel and the bottom of each vessel holder is connected to tubing which allows washing of the vessels. The vessels can be washed by either applying a vacuum or pushing the liquid through the vessel by using the inert gas plate.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti37742">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>CNA binding buffer<br/>50 mM Tris pH = 7.5<br/>150 mM NaCl<br/>0.1% TWEEN 20</li><li>PBS-T<br/>PBS with 0.1% TWEEN 20</li><li>Reagent B<br/>88% TFA<br/>5% Phenol (if Cysteine is present)<br/>5% ddH<sub>2</sub>O<br/>2% TIPS<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti37743">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This work was funded by NIGMS grants DP2GM123641 and R01GM107132.
