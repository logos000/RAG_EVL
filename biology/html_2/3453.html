            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the common demyelinating disease of human central nervous system. Among mouse models available to study MS, including the cuprizone application and lysolecithin-injection models, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model is widely used so that chronic EAE model of C57BL/6J can reflect the autoimmune pathogenesis of MS well. Here we introduce the EAE model based on C57BL/6J mice, which is generated by injection of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG 35-55) as an antigen. After immunization with complete Freund's adjuvant, clinical signs and changes in body weight are observed one or two weeks later. The EAE model will continue to be useful for development of therapeutics for MS.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) and is thought to have autoimmune etiology (Thompson <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Current therapeutic treatments mainly target lymphocytes; however, this can cause serious side effects and does not provide sufficient therapeutic efficacy for those with progressive MS. Therefore, animal models of MS are important for further elucidation of pathological mechanisms and discovery of new treatments. Available pathological mouse model of MS, including the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, the cuprizone application model, and lysolecithin-injection models, each has its own advantages (Kipp <em>et al.</em>, 2017). EAE is used widely to study MS (Ransohoff, 2012; Baker and Amor, 2014). All EAE models enable investigation of both the immune system and CNS, which are the targets of MS therapies (Mix <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Although there are several animal models of EAE, two are common in MS research (Burrows <em>et al.</em>, 2019). One is the C57BL/6 mouse, which is immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (Mendel <em>et al.</em>, 1995), and the other is the SJL mouse, which is immunized with proteolipid protein (PLP) (Tuohy <em>et al.</em>, 1988). The former develops chronic EAE (Mendel <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Bittner <em>et al.</em>, 2014) and is more popular because the C57BL/6J strain has abundant genomic resources (Gold <em>et al.</em>, 2006). The latter model develops remitting and relapsing disease, which does not happen in the MOG-EAE model; therefore, this model is used as a model for relapsing-remitting MS (Tuohy <em>et al.</em>, 1989).<br/><br/>Studies of the mechanisms underlying MS and development of suitable therapies can be conducted using EAE models; however remyelination is difficult to study in EAE model, two toxic models displaying demyelination and remyelination are widely used (Ransohoff, 2012). Cuprizone, a copper chelator, kills oligodendrocytes, resulting in demyelination and remyelination (Matsushima and Morell, 2001), whereas lysolecithin, also called lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), is toxic to the myelin sheath (Hall, 1972). The lysolecithin-injected model has an important characteristic in that demyelination can be controlled both spatially and temporally (Keough <em>et al.</em>, 2015). By contrast, the EAE model better reflects the autoimmune pathogenesis of MS, and represents a secondary progressive form the disease model with some modifications (Tanabe <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Although this EAE model described in this protocol can be generated easily, disease incidence and symptoms vary according to the experimental environment. Therefore, we propose a solid method that can reliably create a C57BL/6J EAE model, which is close to human pathology and highly versatile as an animal model.</p>

Next, when mouse is hanged on the lid of the cage with the only forelimbs, give a score of 2 if lower body can be lifted to grab the lid not only on the forelimbs but also on the hind limbs, and a score of 3 or higher if not. Then, when mouse is put on the flat desk, give a score of 4 or higher if it drags with both hind limbs facing down, and a score of 3 if not. After that, when the lower body of a mouse is lifted, give a score of 5 if the mouse could move by the forelimbs only in one direction, either left or right, and a score of 4 if it could move in both directions.

Changes in weight and clinical symptoms of EAE.</strong> Development of EAE in MOG-immunized C57BL/6 mice. Body weight (A) and clinical score (B) were monitored for 28 days.

The fine powder of MT can be easily mixed with CFA, so that the EAE incidence should be increased.</li><li>Reasons for using a three-way stopcock to get the emulsion (Step D) <br/>It is very important to make a strong emulsion. Therefore, we can judge the completeness of the emulsion by the slipping of syringe operation when we use a 3-way stop-cock.</li><li>Importance of removing the air from the stopcock (Steps D2 and D5)<br/>If the air is not removed, the content of MOG 35-55 and CFA in the emulsion administered to one mouse could decrease, resulting in variability from experiment to experiment. Thus, the air in the three-way stopcock and the syringes should be removed.</li><li>Importance of starting with the CFA syringe first (Step D7)<br/>We have tried both pushing from the CFA syringe and pushing from the MOG syringe in the step of mixing them to make an emulsion. As a result, we found that the former was easy to push when mixing by pushing the syringe, so we recommend pushing the CFA syringe first.</li><li>Necessity of the emulsion injection to two different sites (Step F6)<br/>The location of each emulsion administration targets a different lymph node; the upper back (neck) is an axillary lymph node, and the lower back (root of the hind limb) is an inguinal lymph node. We think that the EAE incidence increases by causing immune responses in various lymph nodes. When the incidence is low, one of the causes could be that the administration position may be far from the lymph nodes.</li><li>Importance of daily body weight measurement (Step G1)<br/>Since worsening of symptoms and weight loss correlate, it is considered that recording weight together with the clinical score leads to proper evaluation of EAE. Moreover, weight loss often occurs before the appearance of EAE clinical scores, which helps to avoid overlooking the clinical score of 1.</li><li>Importance of daily clinical score evaluation (Step G2)<br/>EAE pathological condition can be evaluated by confirming daily changing symptoms with clinical score. This symptom evaluation with drug administration or genetically modified mice leads to elucidation of the disease state and evaluation of the therapeutic effect. Thus, daily scoring is important. Clinical symptoms become apparent about 10-14 days after antigen immunization, and then reach the maximum score within a few days to a week, and often become chronic as it is. The incidence is 90-100%.</li><li>Importance of the genetic background<br/>Genetic background is very important because MOG 35-55 EAE model does not work in SJL mice, and PLP 139-151 EAE model does not work in C57BL/6J mice. However, NOD (non-obese diabetes) mouse is also usable for MOG EAE model.
