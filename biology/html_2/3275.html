            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cell motility has been extensively studied in <em>in vitro</em> models using fibroblasts and keratocytes, but the cell type-specific mechanisms underlying migration of lineage- or disease-specific cells, such as neural and glial progenitor cells, remain an active field for investigation. The migrating neural and glial progenitor cells contribute to the development, tissue repair and tumor invasion in the central nervous system (CNS). Cell migration is a highly dynamic process which relies on membranous protrusions to assemble, extend, disassemble and retract. In the CNS, the motility of neural and glial progenitor cells is affected by various cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms such as signaling molecules, actin and microtubule interactions, and environmental cues. Here, we described a live-cell migration assay for use in the assessment of neural and glial progenitor cell migration. We first will demonstrate the procedures for isolating and culturing neural and glial progenitor cells. Next, we will demonstrate the acquisition of time-lapse images using phase contrast microscopy, the methods for quantification and the analyses of various motility parameters including speed, velocity, straightness and leading-edge dynamics. This method allows researchers to dissect the mechanisms of cell motility in response to different environmental cues, such as chemoattractive and repulsive signals, matrix adhesiveness and stiffness. This assay also allows researchers to study migration of pharmacologically and genetically manipulated cells.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Cell migration plays a key role in many physiological (morphogenesis, tissue repair, regeneration) and pathological (tumor metastasis, atherosclerosis) processes. It is a highly orchestrated multistep process, which requires dynamic interactions between cells and the extracellular cues such as chemokines and signals from the extracellular matrix. In response to the extracellular cues, cells acquire a polarized morphology. Cell polarization requires delicate regulation of microtubule and actin polymerization for asymmetrical distribution of signaling molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, and directional vesicle trafficking. At the leading edge, actin polymerization drives the extension of membrane protrusions, such as lamellipodia (facilitating focal adhesion formation to anchor the protrusion) and filopodia (sensing the environment). In order to move forward, cells have to disassemble adhesions on the trailing edge and retract the trailing end, which require coordination of microtubule and actin networks (Palazzo and Gundersen, 2002; Wehrle-Haller and Imhof, 2003; Etienne-Manneville, 2004). Disruption of cell migration and polarization would affect the process of neurogenesis, and may lead to neurodevelopmental disorders or brain tumor progression (Rakic, 2003; GÃ¶tz and Huttner, 2005; Taylor <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2016). <br/><br/>Neural and glial progenitor cells are the major proliferating and migrating cells in the CNS, and are crucial for the development of neurological functions of an organism. Neural and glial progenitor cells have also been implicated as the cell origin of gliomas. Indeed, glioma migration and infiltration recapitulate key aspects of glial progenitor cell migration during development. Specifically, glioma cells, similar to glial progenitors in the developing CNS, bear a unipolar or a bipolar morphology with a leading process and migrate along white matter tracts and blood vessels (Cayre <em>et al.</em>, 2009). <br/><br/>In this report, we will introduce a live-cell migration assay and the analytical methods which allow us to study cell motility in the presence of inhibitors or different environmental cues. We will first demonstrate how to isolate and culture neural and glial progenitor cells. Next, we will demonstrate our approach to capturing time-lapse images, and to tracking migrating cells for quantification. The live-cell migration assay can be applied to neural and glial progenitor cells as well as to tumor spheres. This assay can also be used to study cell motility in response to inhibitors, different extracellular substrates and stiffness, attractive or repulsive cues, as well as changes in the electrical field (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2015) without optimizing the duration of migration and final detection.</p>
