            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients present a micro inflammation state due to failure renal function. The calcitriol has been described as an anti-inflammatory factor that might modulates the inflammatory response in CKD patients. However, these patients have deficiency of Calcitriol due to failure renal function. But, synthesis of this vitamin has been reported in extra renal production, as in monocytes. In this context, it has been reported that the supplementation with 25 vitamin D (calcidiol or inactive form of vitamin D) induces monocytes to downregulate inflammation, due to the intracellular 1Î±-hidroxilase that converts calcidiol to calcitriol in these cells. Besides some reports used RT-qPCR, Western Blot or immunofluorescence techniques to investigate the expression of inflammatory and vitamin D machinery biomarkers in several disease, in the present study we used flow cytometry technique to evaluate the effect of 25 vitamin D on CD14, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), vitamin D receptor (VDR), 1-Î± hydroxylase (CYP27), 24 hydroxylase (CYP24) in monocytes lineage (U937). The U937 culture was incubated with healthy or CKD serum and treatment with/without 25-vitamin D (50 ng/ml for 24 h) to evaluate CD14, TRL4, VDR, CYP27 and CYP24 expression. This protocol showed the advantage to investigate the effect of treatment with 25 vitamin D on the intracellular and cell membrane biomarkers expression quickly and simultaneously. In addition, this technique is not laborious, but easy to perform and to interpret compared to RT-qPCR, western blot or immunofluorescence.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is characterized by the failure filtration rate resulting in serum accumulation of toxic substances, called uremic toxins (Vanholder <em>et al.</em>, 2003). It has been shown that uremic toxins induce an inflammatory response in patients with CKD (Rossi <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Borges <em>et al.</em>, 20 16; Kaminski <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Several studies have been reported a relationship between uremic toxins as indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate, and indole-3-acetic acid with inflammation (Rossi <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Lau <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Onal <em>et al.</em>, 2019). These toxins signalize NF-Ä¸B, oxidative stress, upregulated cytokines, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (Bolati <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Shimizu <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Stockler-Pinto <em>et al.</em>, 2018), and induce endothelial injury, contributing to endothelial dysfunction (Carmona <em>et al.</em>, 2017). In addition, with the loss of renal function, there is no synthesis of the 1Î±-hidroxilase enzyme that converts calcidiol (25(OH)D/inactive form of vitamin D) to calcitriol (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>Dâactive form of vitamin D). The uremic toxins and deficiency of calcitriol have been described to contribute to inflammation in this population (Franca Gois <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The calcitriol has been described as anti-inflammatory (Tsoukas <em>et al.</em>, 1984; Mathieu and Adorini, 2002). However, in the last 20 years, it has been reported that there is an extra renal production of this vitamin, mainly in monocytes (Stumpf <em>et al.</em>, 1979; Schwartz <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Cross <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Holick, 2007, Gombart <em>et al.</em>, 2007). The monocytes have the enzyme 1Î±-hydroxylase (CYP27) that convert calcidiol (25(OH)Dâinactive form of vitamin D) to calcitriol (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D) and 24 hidroxilase (CYP24) that regulate 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D over production. The extrarenal synthesis of calcitriol might be linked to autocrine and paracrine biologic regulatory mechanisms, mainly in cells of the immunologic system (Aranow, 2011; Holick, 2012). Besides, the monocytes have TLR-4 and TLR-2 receptors that recognize antigens and activation of these receptors increased expression of VDR (vitamin D receptor) and CYP27, both regulate the conversion of inactive to active form of vitamin D (Kreutz <em>et al.</em>, 1993).<br/> <br/>As uremic toxins and hypovitaminosis D are important in inflammatory state in CKD environment, the aim of our study was to evaluate <em>in vitro</em> the effect of 25-vitamin D on TLR4, VDR, CYP27 and CYP24 in human monocyte lineage (U937). For this purpose, we evaluated TLR4 and the vitamin D intracellular mechanisms by flow cytometry.<br/> <br/>In fact, in our previous study, we have already used this protocol and observed that 25(OH)D improved CYP27 and decreased IL-6, IFN-Î³, TLR7 and TLR9 intracellular expression in lymphocytes from dialysis patients (Carvalho <em>et al.</em>, 2017).<br/> <br/>The VDR, CYP27 and CYP24 can be detected by other techniques such as RT-qPCR, Western-blot and immunohistochemistry as reported by Zou <em>et al.</em> (2019). In this study, authors investigated the effect of Shenyuan granules on the Klotho/FGFR23/Egr1 signaling pathway and calcium-phosphorus metabolism in diabetic nephropathy. Similarly, Chang <em>et al.</em> (Chang and Kim, 2019; Chang, 2019) investigated the effect of vitamin D on muscle cell (C2C12) proliferation and differentiation via VDR, CYP24 and CYP27 by RT-qPCR.<br/> <br/>Although RT-qPCR, Western Blot and Immunofluorescence are techniques with high sensitivity and specificity to assess the expression of the TLR4, VDR, CYP27 and CYP24 gene, these are laborious techniques, requiring several stages for their performance (which can contribute to the failure of the techniques), require a large number of cells, high cost compared to the protocol described in the present study using flow cytometry, which is less laborious and easy to perform. Besides CKD patients, this protocol can also be applied in other researches and clinical areas such as oncology, auto immune disease, immune response, since vitamin D may modulate several cell types as lymphocytes that expression VDR, CYP27 and CYP24.</p>
