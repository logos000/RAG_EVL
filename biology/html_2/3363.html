            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is an excellent model for studying neural responses to injury and elucidating the mechanisms that can facilitate axon regeneration. As such, several animal models have been employed to study regenerative mechanisms after PNI, including Aplysia, zebrafish, rabbits, cats and rodents. This protocol describes how to perform a sciatic nerve injury and repair in mice, one of the most frequently used models to study mechanisms that facilitate recovery after PNI, and that takes advantage of the availability of many genetic models. In this protocol, we describe a method for using fibrin glue to secure the proximal and distal stumps of an injured nerve in close alignment. This method facilitates the alignment of nerve stumps, which aids in regeneration of both sensory and motor axons and allows successful reconnection with peripheral targets. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) are an important clinical problem and recovery outcomes are generally poor (Jensen <em>et al.</em>, 2001; HÃ¶ke and Brushart, 2010). Additionally, treatments for these injuries have not much changed in the last 100 years (Mundie, 1920; Taylor <em>et al.</em>, 2008). As such, models of PNI have become important to understand potential barriers to regeneration and treatments for enhancing it. While in humans and larger mammals, such as cats, suturing through the epineurium is a common mechanism of repair (Lundborg, 2002; Grinsell and Keating, 2014; Raslan <em>et al.</em>, 2014), this treatment is not reliably performed in mice. First, the diameter of the sciatic nerve is less than 2 mm making the placement of epineurial sutures technically challenging. Second, in comparison to nerves in larger animals, axons in mouse nerves are more likely to exude from cut nerves or âmushroom outâ when the epineurium is penetrated during placement of sutures, making clean repair of the cut nerves difficult. Finally, placement of sutures in small rodents can interfere with the blood supply of regenerating nerves. One method that can overcome these challenges is the use of fibrin glue, a tool that was first utilized in human patients (Egloff and Narkas, 1983; MacGillivray, 2003). The implementation of fibrin glue in experimental animals (as models to assess its benefits for human nerve repair) also has a long history; decades ago it was found to be as effective as epineurial sutures for repair of the rat sciatic nerve (Nishihira, 1988). We describe a method to repair a mouse sciatic nerve injury that facilitates nerve regeneration in experimental situations. First, we use a fibrin glue formula, derived from human and bovine blood components, that was previously found to enhance repair in central nervous system axon tracts (Guest <em>et al.</em>, 1997). Second, we secure the nerve by adhering it to a silastic mat prior to transection. This ensures a minimal gap between the proximal and distal nerve stumps and enhanced stability, without having to leave a piece of the epineurium intact, which is a technically difficult approach and can result in leaving some axons uninjured. The improved coaptation and increased stability diminishes the incidence of dehiscence reported without suture stabilization (Cruz <em>et al.</em>, 1986). While the components of fibrin glue may interact with the immune system (Schoenecker <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Mosesson, 2005; Kelsh <em>et al.</em>, 2014), this strategy has been used extensively in both rats and mice with great success. Comprehensive comparisons of nerve repair efficiency using fibrin glues compared to epineurial sutures have been recently published (Adel <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Koulaxouzidis <em>et al.</em>, 2017, Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2018). In our hands, the protocol described facilitates sciatic nerve reformation in mice by two months following injury as quantified by complete motor muscle reinnervation assessed by re-occupancy of neuromuscular junctions and electromyography with an almost 100% success rate (Wilhelm <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Rotterman <em>et al.</em>, 2019). As a further advantage, drugs or other compounds can be added to the glue to test how different factors administered peripherally (and directly on the nerve) may impact regeneration (Wilhelm <em>et al.</em>, 2012). These nerve repair surgeries are all done in adult (3+ month) C57Blk/6 mice, but can easily be transferred to other species and ages. </p>

If making large aliquots for multiple surgeries ensure that fresh pipette tips are used to extract solution each time as even contact mixing may cause premature coagulation of the aliquots. </li><li>If excessive bleeding occurs, stop bleeding with Gelfoam<sup>Â®</sup> (Pfizer) prior to continuation with surgery. The repair area must be relatively dry to ensure proper coagulation of fibrin glue.</li><li>Additional glue may be used to secure the nerve further after surgery if necessary. The fibrin glue needs to stabilize the two nerve stumps, if any of the two nerve stumps is not perfectly secure or covered more fibrin glue can be added.</li><li>Sharp scissors are imperative for the nerve cut to ensue minimal feathering of nerve ends and no gap between proximal and distal nerve stumps.</li><li>Nerve repairs are initially fragile after surgery. Be careful when moving mice while anesthetized not to disturb the leg. Connective tissue quickly holds the repair in place in the days following surgery.</li><li>As a control, sham surgeries should be conducted by exposing the nerve and freeing it from connective tissue. Placing of SILASTIC mat without fibrin glue and/or nerve cut may also serve as appropriate shams. <br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29278">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This work was supported by the grants from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Grants P01NS057228 and R56NS099092 to F.J.A., NS057196 to A.W.E. and a Ruth L.
