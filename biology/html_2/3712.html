            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The quantitative measurement of water flow-induced swimming of fish species using a swimmill is a powerful method to evaluate motor ability of individual fish. Zebrafish is a commonly used vertebrate that enables the study of morphological, physiological and behavioral characteristics associated with genes. We here established a reproducible method that allows to measure the body length and the critical swimming speed of adult zebrafish using a swimmill.<br/></p>
            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> Motor, Speed, Swimmill, Swimming, Zebrafish</p>
            <h2>Background</h2><p>To evaluate motor ability of fish, swimmill systems have been used for measurement of critical swimming speed (<em>U<sub>crit</sub></em>), which is the maximum water velocity in which fish can keep swimming. Many different swimmill equipments and protocols have been used for zebrafish studies (Table 1) and thus, it was difficult to compare results of different experiments and different protocols due to the lack of detailed calibration methods and protocols. We applied commercially available swimmill equipment Swim Tunnel Respirometer, which is the major and standard one among zebrafish researchers, established a reproducible protocol for obtaining basic swimming characteristics of adult zebrafish, such as adequate water temperature and adequate length of caudal fin among various wild-type strains (Wakamatsu <em>et al.</em>, 2019). We here describe the detailed methods to monitor dissolved oxygen for the estimation of oxygen consumption in swimming, to measure body size of adult zebrafish, to conduct calibration of water velocity, to acclimate zebrafish to the narrow swimming chamber and to measure swimming speed. This protocol would be useful for researchers who use swimmill.<br/>â<br/><strong>Table 1. Swimmill equipments.</strong> The absolute value of <em>U<sub>crit</sub></em> measured in adult wild-type zebrafish (3-12 months old) appears to vary by the difference of the swimmill equipments. This is probably due to the size difference of swimming chamber that generates uneven water flow between center and peripheral. Therefore, the comparison of <em>U<sub>crit</sub></em> should be done in the assays that use the same equipment.</p>

The outside tank contributes to maintain water temperature of the double cylinder, which is composed of an external cylinder and an inner swimming chamber (Figure 1B). A propeller in the swimming chamber generates water flow in the double cylinder by controlling the propeller rotation depending on an input voltage controlled by the AutoResp software. It is necessary to calibrate the input voltage and water velocity. This calibration can be done by flowing green fluorescent micro beads in the swimming chamber using high-speed camera controlling software uEye Cockpit and analyzing velocity of moving beads using DPTV.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200813/20200813094004_4555.jpg" width="73"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

The <em>U<sub>crit</sub></em> of fish is calculated according to the established formula (Brett, 1964). <em>U<sub>crit</sub></em> = <em>U<sub>max</sub></em> + T/60. <em>U<sub>max</sub></em> (cm/s): the highest water velocity when zebrafish continued to swim for whole 1 min.

The total length and standard length are measurable in comparison with pre-marked 3 cm distance lines in a frame of swimming movies (dorsal view). In ImageJ software, draw a line of 3 cm distance and measure the length by pixel using the Analyze/Measure function. Similarly, draw a line along the midline of the fish from the head to the tail and measure the length by pixel and then calculate the actual length by hands. The standard length is calculated by the line from the head to the root of caudal fin. The difference of total and standard lengths is the caudal fin length. The motor ability of zebrafish varies by the length of caudal fin (Wakamatsu <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200813/20200813094526_3896.jpg" width="221"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.
