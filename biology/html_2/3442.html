            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the obligatory intracellular protozoa <em>Leishmania</em> spp. Current therapeutic options are limited and thus, drug discovery against leishmaniasis is very important. Nevertheless, there is a great difficulty to develop therapeutic strategies against the disease because the parasite deploys various mechanisms to evade the immune system and multiply inside the host. Among the main factors of the immunity that are recruited to confront the <em>Leishmania</em> infection are the macrophages (MÎ¦s) that produce effector molecules such as Nitric Oxide (NO) and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Therefore, efficient drug agents should combine the antileishmanial effect of these gaseous transmitters along with the enhancement of the hostâs adaptive immunity. In the quest of therapeutic alternatives, natural products have been extensively studied and are considered as candidate antileishmanial agents since they exhibit specific properties in modulating the hostâs immune response towards an effective anti-leishmanial cell-mediated immunity capable to eliminate parasitic dissemination. In the current protocol, <em>Leishmania</em>-infected MÎ¦s (J774A.1 cell line) that have been treated with various increasing concentrations of a natural compound, are tested for the production of the aforementioned molecules. In order to detect NO production, we employ the Griess colorimetric nitrite assay and quantification relies on the construction of an accurate standard curve using appropriate standards of known concentration. ROS detection and quantification is achieved by flow cytometry and relies on the use of carboxy-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA, an indicator that converts to a fluorescent form when interacts with ROS molecules.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Macrophages (MÎ¦s) are important innate immune effector cells that participate in host defense, providing enhanced antimicrobial activity. They are characterized by a remarkable plasticity and unique abilities to polarize toward different phenotypes. On one hand, classically activated macrophages are known to have major roles in host defense against various microbial pathogens, while alternatively activated macrophages are instrumental in immune regulation and wound healing (Leopold Wager and Wormley, 2014). The term âclassicallyâ activated is used to designate the effector macrophages that are produced during cell-mediated immune responses upon the dual signal of interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), characterized by enhanced microbicidal or tumoricidal capacity and secretion of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune mediators. More specifically, IFN-Î³ is produced by innate (NK cells) or adaptive immune cells (T helper 1 cells) and primes macrophages to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and to produce increased amounts of superoxide anions, oxygen and nitrogen radicals that increase their killing ability (Dale <em>et al.</em>, 2008).<br/><br/>The obligatory intracellular parasites of the genus <em>Leishmania </em>have deployed sophisticated mechanisms to evade and modulate the hostâs immune system for their benefit and consequently, they are able to survive and persist within MÎ¦s. Consequently, in the case of <em>Leishmania </em>infection, MÎ¦s are having a dual role either as effector cells with leishmanicidal activity or as host cells. The fate of <em>Leishmania </em>spp. parasites is determined by the activation status of MÎ¦s (Tomiotto-Pellissier <em>et al.</em>, 2018). âClassicallyâ activated MÎ¦s are capable of killing parasites effectively via the production of Nitric Oxide (NO) upon activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and other leishmanicidal molecules, such as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). NO and ROS are two key players in the macrophage defense system against intracellular parasites (Horta <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Roy <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Nevertheless, <em>Leishmania </em>spp. parasites have been adapted to survive and replicate in this hostile environment by deploying antioxidant systems or by suppressing ROS and NO production (Kumar <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Denkers and Butcher, 2005; Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2013). <br/><br/>In recent years, there is an increasing interest in the study of natural products against leishmaniasis because several plant extracts or isolated compounds exhibit a promising antileishmanial activity which may not only be due to their direct action on parasite but also to a concomitant effect on the hostâs immune response (Rodrigues <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Several natural products have been tested for their ability to increase the production of ROS and/or NO in <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> experimental models of leishmaniasis (Torres-Santos <em>et al.</em>, 1999; do Socorro <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Georgopoulou <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Patricio <em>et al.</em>, 2008).<br/><br/>In this protocol, we aim to quantify the NO and ROS production by <em>Leishmania </em>spp.-infected J774A.1 macrophages as a response to treatment with various increasing concentrations of Total Phenolic Fraction (TPF) derived from Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Angelis <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The quantification of NO is achieved with the use of Griess assay which relies on the accumulation of nitrites in cell culture supernatants. Respectively, the relative quantification of TPF-mediated ROS generation is determined with the use of cell-permeable carboxy-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA fluorescent probe which is deacetylated by cellular esterases to form 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H<sub>2</sub>DCF). In the presence of ROS, predominantly H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>DCF is rapidly oxidized to 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF), which is highly fluorescent, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 498 and 522 nm, respectively (Bae <em>et al.</em>, 2000). These protocols can be used to gain a first <em>in vitro</em> evidence, about whether or not, these immune mechanisms are activated by an antimicrobial agent.</p>
