            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 1.13 billion people worldwide have hypertension, a major factor responsible for premature death globally. The inherent multifactorial nature of hypertension makes its study difficult since the chronic rise in blood pressure depends on the intricate connection between dietary, genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, the pathophysi-ology of hypertension is not completely understood. For these reasons, there is an ongoing search for animal models that better mimic changes resulting from this disease. Because of its complexity, the use of animal models aimed at elucidating the pathogenesis of hypertension and to evaluate new therapeutic possibilities is an important tool for understanding this disease since it enables consistent experimental strategies that are impractical in humans. Over time, many animal models have been developed for the study of chronic increases in blood pressure ranging from genetic models that include the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and genetic manipulations, such as the TGR (mRen2) rat, as well as neurogenic or endocrine models. One of the most commonly used hypertensive rat models today is that of hypertension induced by treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate associated with high sodium intake, <em>i.e.</em>, the DOCA-salt model. This model is known to have a neurogenic component linked to increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and as such the DOCA-salt model promotes cross-talk between endocrine and neural components that lead to increased blood pressure, and may impact the functioning of other organs.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Hypertension is a chronic disease with the highest incidence in the world in that more than 1.13 billion people are hypertensive (Lerman <em>et al.</em>, 2019; https://www.who.int/news-room/fact sheets/detail/hypertension). Although the understanding of the pathophysiology of hypertension has advanced considerably in recent years, it is still very difficult to elucidate the causes, as well as to define effective strategies in the treatment of this disease (Hall <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Collister <em>et al.</em>, 2018). This difficulty is not surprising due to the fact that hypertension is a multifaceted disease resulting from a variety of risk factors (diet, genetics and environment), as well as interactions between them. Adding to this complex nature is the fact that the maintenance of both short and long-term blood pressure is under control of a wide variety of systems such as cardiovascular, neural, endocrine, renal as well as local vascular tissue mediators (Hall <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Basting and Lazartigues, 2017). As in many other human diseases, animal models of hypertension have been a valuable tool in understanding its pathogenesis, enabling experimentais approaches that would be difficult to reproduce in humans (Lerman <em>et al.</em>, 2019). However due to the multifactorial aspects of hypertension, not all available animal models are effective in mimicking the real condition imposed by this disease. One of the most commonly used animal models is mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension in the rat: deoxycorticosteroid acetate (DOCA) which has two variations: 1) DOCA plus added salt (DOCA-salt), which incorporates a high-salt diet (0.6-1% NaCl in the drinking water) and 2) DOCA-salt that is accompanied by uninephrectomy (Zicha <em>et al.</em>, 1989; Grobe <em>et al.</em>, 2011). One of the main advantages of this model is that in both variations, salt sensitivity, a key element for predisposition and development of many cases of hypertension, is present to a similar extent to what occurs in human salt sensitive hypertension (Basting and Lazartigues, 2017).<br/><br/>Previous work in animals non-uninephrectomized animals demonstrated that the development of hypertension occurs more gradually with 28 days of treatment with DOCA resulting in a blood pressure increase of 20 to 30 mmHg (Kandlikar and Fink, 2011). Uninephrectomized animals showed the same pattern of increased blood pressure, but in a shorter period of time after 21 days of treatment with DOCA (Collister <em>et al.</em>, 2018). In both cases, animals treated with DOCA demonstrated a typical hypertensive response in the first 7 days of treatment. But non-uninephrectomized animals showed the magnitude of the increase in blood pressure more modest than uninephrectomized rats. We have utilized 21 days of DOCA treatment in uninephrectomized rats because we observe differences between interventional experimental animals and control animals during this shorter time frame. In this DOCA-salt model accompanied by reduced kidney mass (uninephrectomy), chronic hypertension develops in a biphasic response with an initial rise in BP over first 7 days followed by a sustained elevated BP over days 14-21 that eventually reaches 125-135 mmHg (Collister <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>Since this model is thought to have a neurogenic component mediating the rise in arterial pressure, we sought to determine which area(s) of the brain may be involved in the chronic hypertensive response to DOCA. Therefore, we have previously used this model to investigate the role of the subfornical organ (SFO) and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) in the control of arterial blood pressure. Both of these central nuclei are defined as circumventricular organs, hypothalamic structures lacking the blood brain barrier, allowing blood born chemicals such as hormones to gain access to the brain. Previous studies were performed separately in which rats were subjected to electrolytic lesion of either the SFO or OVLT, or respective sham control operation. In the first study, we reported that SFO does not play a significant role in the development of DOCA-salt hypertension as rats with lesions of the SFO responded with a similar chronic hypertensive response to DOCA compared to rats with sham lesions of the SFO. In contrast, lesion of the OLVT significantly attenuated the chronic hypertensive response in rats that consumed a high-salt diet treated with DOCA. Therefore, we concluded the hypertensive response in DOCA-treat rats requires an intact OVLT but not SFO (Osborn <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Collister <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>In summary, while every animal model has its limitations in comparison to human disease, the DOCA-salt hypertensive model in rats is a reliable animals model that closely mimics many human forms of hypertension in that there are volume-dependent, vascular, and neurogenic components that impact both central and peripheral nervous systems (Basting and Lazartigues, 2017, Collister <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Lerman <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>Finally, in addition to animal models that mimic the physiological changes typical of hypertension, accurate monitoring and recording of blood pressure fluctuations in animal research has helped researchers to unravel several mechanisms involved in the physiology and pathophysiology of diseases such as hypertension and heart failure (Huetteman and Bogie, 2009). Blood pressure and heart rate can be measured directly from the implantation of radio telemetry devices which are considered the âgold standardâ for the measurement of these parameters in intact, conscious laboratory animals during normal behavioral and physiological states (Zhao <em>et al.</em>, 2011). These data are collected and recorded without direct humanâanimal contact during the measurements. Figure 1 shows the basic components of telemetry system used in this protocol.<br/></p>

Basic Components of Telemetry System</strong> (for more information we recommend to consult Reference 5). 1) Telemetry implant is a device inserted in the ratâs abdominal cavity and subsequently senses, measures and transmits the information of mean pressure and heart rate to a nearby receiver via radio telemetry. 2) The RPC-1 receiver detects the transmitted signals from the implant and converts them into a readable form by the computer, and is positioned under or near the animal's cage. 3) Data Exchange Matrix immediately detects the type and serial number of the RPC-1 receiver and forwards this information to the acquisition system. 4) The Data Acquisition System (hardware, software, and computer) removes most corrupt values obtained telemetrically and converts them to common units. In addition, it provides built in routines to plot and analyze acquired data. 5) The Ambient Pressure Reference (APR 1) is needed to measure barometric pressure. Thus, the pressure values detected by the <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> APR-1 </a> are used to correct the pressure measurements obtained from the implant for changes in barometric pressure.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti35052">## Materials and Reagents</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Needles (Standard Hypodermic Needles, Monoject<sup>TM</sup> , catalog numbers: <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> 8881250255 [23G] </a> , <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> 8881250149 [21G] </a> ), stored at room temperature</li><li>Sterile drape, 18â x 26â (McKesson Minor Procedure Drape, catalog number: <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> 25-517 </a> ), stored at room temperature</li><li>Tape (TimeMed Labeling System, catalog number: <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> 3114 </a> ), stored at room temperature</li><li>Syringe (1 ml Tuberculin Syringe Regular Tip) (Monoject<sup>TM</sup> , catalog number: <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> 8881501400 </a> , stored at room temperature</li><li>Syringe (3 ml Luer Lock Syringes) (Monoject<sup>TM</sup> , catalog number: <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> 8881513934 </a> ), stored at room temperature</li><li>Sterile Gloves (Synthetical Surgical Gloves Powder-Free, Confiderm<sup>Â®</sup> SPT), stored at room temperature</li><li>Gauze sponges (Non-woven Gauze Sponges, 2 in. x 2 in.

A collection funnel and separating cone (6) provide complete separation of feces and urine (For more information we recommend to consult <a href="http://www.ancare.com/products/cages-and-caging-equipment/metabolic-cages/nalgene-metabolic-cage-rats-and-mice" target="_blank">Ancare website</a>).<br/><br/></li><li>After 2 weeks of recovery, keep all rats housed individually in metabolic cages (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY), provide 0.1% NaCl diet and ad libitum 0.9% NaCl drinking solution.</li><li>During this period measure 24-h water and food intake. These measures are obtained by subtracting the amount of water/food offered by the amount of water/food remaining on the following day at the same time.</li><li>To measure the urine output, note the volume contained in the specific cylinder located under the cage.</li><li>Calculate sodium intake as the sum of the sodium received from saline intake (0.154 meq/ml) plus the product of the food intake and the sodium content of the food (0.1% NaCl, 3570.0175 mmol/g).</li><li>Calculate the daily sodium and water balances as the difference between intake and urinary excretion of sodium and water, respectively.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>DOCA or sham pellets implant surgery<br/>Make the DOCA and sham silicone implants at least 72 h prior to surgical implantation.<br/><strong>Pellet preparation</strong><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Weigh 100 mg of DOCA into one small weigh boat (see Figure 2; B2). Repeat for as many needed within the week.</li><li>Draw up 2 ml of Part A of Sylgard 184 Silicone in 3 ml syringe, and add to the weigh boat with the pre-weighed DOCA. Mix thoroughly will spatula for ~30-45 s. Be sure to break up any small clumps, as homogeneity is extremely important to the quality of the pellet*.<br/><em>Note: *This is a critical step in the preparation of pellets. If these are not well homogenized absorption rate is not consistent and the results may be confounded due to variability.</em> </li><li>Draw up 0.2 ml of curing agent from the silicone kit in a 1 ml syringe, and add the 0.2 ml to the silicone mixture. Mix thoroughly again for ~30-45 s.</li><li>Cover with pre-labeled aluminum foil (<em>i.e.</em>, 100 mg DOCA and date), and set aside to cure for 24 h at room temperature.</li><li>Let the DOCA implants cure at room temperature for 24 h and then refrigerate at 4 Â°C until the day of the surgical implantation.</li><li>The sham pellets are prepared as a vehicle identically as described above without the addition of the DOCA.<br/>Implantation: This procedure must be performed after 5 control days after the 2 weeks recovery period (see Figure 4).</li><li>Prior to surgery, use a sterile scalpel to slice DOCA pellet into ~1-2 mm<sup>3</sup> pieces, and transfer contents to large, ethanol-cleaned spatula.</li><li>After anesthetizing all rats and providing pre-surgical treatments and disinfection procedures as described above, implant DOCA or sham pellets.</li><li>Shave and clean the left flank. Make a skin incision (~3-4 cm), and use a mayo scissors to form a subcutaneous pocket.</li><li>Insert spatula into opening, and push the pellet (one per rat) into pocket.</li><li>Close surgical site with staples or suture.</li><li>As describe above, after surgery keep the animals in individual cages, half of the cage must be kept on the heating pad until they return from anesthesia.<br/><em>Note: Pellets will likely stick or pile up, so be sure to flatten and disperse with finger pressure once the surgical opening is closed.</em> </li><li>Return rats to their home cages upon recovery and provide analgesia to the rats with ketoprofen (2.5 mg/kg IP) once daily for 3 days post-surgery. Continue to provide ad libitum access to their 0.1% NaCl powdered food and 0.9% NaCl drinking solution.</li><li>Maintain the rats individually housed in respective metabolic cage, which are positioned on the receiver (set up DSI monitoring equipment [Figure 1], 500 Hz for 10 s/min) and make daily measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), food and water intake and urine output for 21 days after DOCA implantation.<br/><em>Note: After placing the animals in the individual metabolic cages located on the receivers, it is important to wait 15-25 min for the cardiac parameters to return to baseline levels.</em><br/>â<br/></li><p class="ppzz" style="margin-left:-25px;"><strong>Euthanasia</strong> </p><li>At the end of the experiment, euthanize the rats deeply with a lethal dose of pentobarbital sodium (65 mg/kg, intraperitoneal).</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti35056">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz">Twenty-four-hour averages were collected for BP, HR, sodium intake, sodium output, water intake and urine output.
