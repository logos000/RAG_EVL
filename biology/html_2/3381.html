            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Wheel running, especially in the homecage, has been widely used to study the neurobiology of exercise because animal tends to use it voluntarily. However, as for each reward, its consumption (in the present case, running performance) does not specifically provide information on its incentive value, <em>i.e.</em>, the extent to which animals are motivated to run independently from their consumption of that reward. This is a major drawback, especially when focusing on the neurobiology governing the pathological imbalances between exercise and <em>e.g.</em>, feeding (obesity, anorexia nervosa). Yet, few studies have shown that operant conditioning wherein wheel-running is used as a reinforcer that can be "consumed" after nose-poking or lever-pressing allows to distinguish motivation from consumption. Thus, nose-poking or lever-pressing under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement in animals trained under fixed ratio reinforcement schedules provides, through the so-called breakpoint, an index of running motivation. As compared to wheel-running, numerous studies have used food as a reinforcer, which helped to uncover the neurobiology of feeding. However, to our knowledge, there is no paradigm allowing the assessment of the choice between running and feeding when presented in concurrence, with the possibility to measure <em>a priori</em> the motivation for each reward. Herein, we describe a protocol that first permits to measure the drive for each of these two rewards before it allows to measure the preference for one over the other in a reward choice setting. This paradigm could help to better characterize the neurobiology underlying pathological imbalances between physical activity and feeding, which is the core feature of eating disorders.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Physical inactivity is a growing burden for society nowadays, and it finds its root in a lack of motivation to engage in or to adhere to a long-term exercise program (Ekkekakis <em>et al.</em>, 2008). More broadly, eating disorders result from an alteration of the energy balance, between caloric intake (<em>e.g.</em>, food intake) and expenses (<em>e.g.</em>, physical activity). Interestingly, such an alteration finds its origin at the motivation level. It is thus of prime importance to study in a combined manner the motivation for physical activity with the motivation for food intake. To unravel the neurobiology behind exercise motivation, most studies have used the running wheel paradigm as wheel-running is a volitional and well-conserved behavior with highly rewarding properties (Sherwin, 1998). Indeed wheel running is able to reinforce operant conditioning (Belke, 1997), even when the duration of running is minimal (Iversen, 1993). The basic principle of operant conditioning is to render the reward access contingent to the realization of an effort (<em>e.g.</em>, lever pressing, nose-poking). By progressively increasing the effort, it allows estimating the animalâs motivation for this reward. However, studying motivation for physical activity in the context of eating disorders requires to compare it with the motivation for food intake in order to integrate both aspects of energy balance. Noteworthy is the observation that the comparison between the maximal efforts the animal displays for each reward taken individually can be misleading because it doesnât represent the preference for one reward over another in the natural context of a choice between these rewards (Cantin <em>et al.</em>, 2010, in this paper the authors designed an operant conditioning protocol to assess the choice between cocaine and sucrose). A previous study investigated the choice between wheel-running and sucrose in a T-maze (Correa <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Although providing a cue with regard to the preference between the rewards under effort-less conditions, this approach does not allow to dissect the motivation for each reward from its mere consumption. To our knowledge, the protocol we are describing here is the first to allow the <em>a priori</em> assessment of motivation for both wheel running and palatable food, and the preference for one over the other in a concurrent choice context using operant conditioning (Muguruza <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Such a protocol allows access to both sides of the energy balance as to study the mechanisms involved in such a regulation. Furthermore, by modulating the effort that is required for each reward, one can externally affect the preference for one reward over the other one, hence helping to assess the neurobiological grounds governing each preference level. As it is the case for most studies investigating reward neurobiology, our protocol bears some limitations. Even though animals are always exposed to the operant chambers during their active phase (dark phase), this daily single and restricted exposure cannot fully recapitulate the human situation. Indeed, the animals are exposed to this concurrent choice once a day in a different environment than their homecage when humans have permanently to choose between concurrent rewarding activities. One possibility to circumvent this limitation would be to host the animal in an operant chamber where it would access running and feeding activities, these being fully contingent to an effort (namely nose poking).</p>
