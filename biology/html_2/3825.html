            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Neurotropic reoviruses repurpose host machinery to traffic over long distances in neuronal processes and access distal replication sites. Understanding mechanisms of neuronal transmission is facilitated by using simplified <em>in vitro</em> primary neuronal culture models. Advances in the design of compartmentalized microfluidic devices lend robustness to neuronal culture models by enabling compartmentalization and manipulation of distinct neuronal processes. Here, we describe a streamlined methodology to culture sensory neurons dissociated from dorsal root ganglia of embryonic rats in microfluidic devices. We further describe protocols to exogenously label reovirus and image, track, and analyze transport of single reovirus particles in living neurons. These techniques can be adapted to study directed axonal transport of other neurotropic viruses and neuronal factors involved in signaling and pathology.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Viruses from diverse families including the Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Picornaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae, breach protective barriers of the nervous system inflicting severe disease and economic burden (Koyuncu <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Bohmwald <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Tyler, 2018). Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus), belonging to the Reoviridae, causes serotype-dependent neuronal infection in a wide variety of young mammals that can result in lethal encephalitis (Tyler <em>et al.</em>, 1986; Dermody <em>et al.</em>, 2013]. Reovirus is nonenveloped with a segmented dsRNA genome encased by two concentric protein shells and serves as a pliable tool to study viral infections of the nervous system (Dermody <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Although cellular and molecular mechanisms of reovirus infection have been widely studied using transformed cell lines, these systems do not capture the complexities of polarized neuronal cells. Viruses infecting neurons must travel over long distances in axons to reach distal sites of replication and egress. To understand mechanisms of reovirus entry and long-distance transport in neurons, we recently adapted techniques to culture primary neurons and image fluorescently labeled reovirus in living cells (Aravamudhan <em>et al.</em>, 2020).<br/><br/><em></em>In vitro culture of primary neurons from embryonic and adult rodents provide simplified yet robust tools to study neuronal function and pathology. Dissociated sensory neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) can be propagated <em>in vitro</em> and are used widely to study axonal regeneration and peripheral neuropathies (Haberberger <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Melli and Hoke, 2009). DRGs are clusters of neuronal cell bodies located proximal to the spinal cord and relay sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. DRG neurons are pseudo-unipolar with no dendrites and one axon that bifurcates into two processes, one synapsing with peripheral organs and another connecting to the spinal cord. DRGs are infected during neuroinvasion by several viruses and have been used to study infection mechanisms (Flamand <em>et al.</em>, 1991; Smith <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Volpi <em>et al.</em>, 2018). We describe procedures to cultivate dissociated DRG neurons from rat embryos. We also have used this protocol to cultivate DRG neurons from embryonic mice, which provide a more robust system amenable to genetic manipulation. However, we found that reovirus infects rat neurons more efficiently than mouse neurons in culture (unpublished observations). Therefore, the system must be chosen carefully depending on the application.<br/><br/><em> In vitro</em> neuron culture in combination with microfluidic devices offers a powerful system to isolate neuronal soma from axons and distinguish axonal transport in the anterograde (soma to axonal termini) and retrograde (axonal termini to soma) directions (Neto <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Microfluidic devices allow use of small quantities of reagents and provide access to neuronal microenvironments for studies of axonal growth and injury, biochemical investigations, and high-resolution imaging. The commercial availability of microfluidic devices makes it accessible to everyone without need of sophisticated fabrication instruments. We describe use of a commercially available two-compartment system for culturing DRG neurons and imaging reovirus transport (Nagendran <em>et al.</em>, 2018). This device was developed by Xona microfluidics and comes preassembled on optically transparent plastic suitable for high-resolution imaging.<br/><br/> We share an integrated set of protocols to isolate and culture DRG neurons in microfluidic devices to study reovirus transport. In addition, we describe image analysis tools to track single reovirus particles and share programs to obtain biophysical parameters describing reovirus transport. These methods can be adapted to investigate molecular mechanisms of viral neuronal infection. Individual aspects of this procedure can be applied to fluorescently label other nonenveloped viruses, study transport of other neurotropic pathogens, and dissect functions of local RNA and protein metabolism in axonal signaling. Extension of co-culture techniques can be used to study communication between neurons and glia and peripheral tissues. Culture of neurons in microfluidic devices embedded with electrode arrays can be used to simultaneously study electrical activity and biochemical signaling, further enhancing the utility of protocols described here.</p>

Microfluidic device configuration. </strong>A. Schematic depicts a microfluidic device with microgrooves connecting the two compartments. B-C. Each microfluidic device has two compartments (B) connected by thin grooves (enlarged in C). The left and right compartments are arbitrarily designated as somal and axonal compartments. Each compartment has two wells connected by the main channel. During sterilization and coating steps, volumes can be added by pointing the pipette tip away from the entrance to the main channel as depicted in the bottom left well. To seed dissociated neurons, introduce cells at the entrance to the main channel by pointing the pipette as depicted in the top left well. D. Set-up of microfluidic devices for experiments. Three Xona<sup>TM</sup> microfluidic devices are arranged within a 150 mm Petri dish and covered with a lid to maintain sterility. A smaller 35 mm Petri dish without a lid is filled with water and placed within the larger dish to create a humidified environment. E. Representative micrographs (adapted from            Aravamudhan <em>et al.</em>, 2020            ) show extension of axons into the axonal compartment 7 days post-plating of dissociated DRG neurons in the somal compartment. Neurons were stained with markers for nuclei (DAPI) and axons (non-phosphorylated neurofilament H, NF). Scale bar, 50 Âµm.</p><br/><p>This set up will provide a humidified environment and is essential to minimize evaporation of liquid from microfluidic devices.</p><p><em>Note: For large-scale experiments, it may be more cost-effective to engineer microfluidic devices in-house. Devices at a lower price are also available for in-house assembly on glass coverslips (Example: Xona Microfluidics, SND450). However, we find the latter approach to be cumbersome, often resulting in leaky devices, and we prefer preassembled devices.</em> </p></li><li><p>Follow these general instructions during handling and preparation of microfluidic devices in subsequent steps (protocol adapted from the manufacturerâs instructions).</p><ol class="npwthree"><li><p>Work with four or less devices at a time to maintain sufficient moisture.</p></li><li><p>While adding liquid, always keep the pipette tip pointing away from the entrance to the main channel (Figures 1B-1C) and dispense slowly, taking care not to introduce bubbles into the main channels or microgrooves. When removing liquid, leave some behind and never allow the main channels to dry out. Bring all liquids to room temperature before adding to devices to avoid formation of bubbles.</p></li><li><p>To sterilize, coat, or wash devices:</p><ol class="npwfour"><li>First remove any liquid from the device and slowly dispense volume into the top left well of the device.

For these applications, apply PDL-laminin coatings only to the depressed glass-covered portion of the dish and plate neurons in a small volume of medium only in this area for 4 hours before flooding the entire dish with medium.

The complete medium contains NGF, while the base medium does not.</em> </p></li><li><p>Coat a fire-polished pipette with complete medium by pipetting 10 times. This will prevent neurons from sticking to the walls of the pipette during the next dissociation step. Pipette DRG suspension in complete medium ~15 times to dissociate until there are no more visible clusters and the cells are uniformly suspended. Do not introduce bubbles and avoid excess pipetting to limit damage to cells and maintain viability.</p></li><li><p>Mix 10 Î¼l each of dissociated DRG suspension and trypan blue.

Work with one device at a time, and do not allow wells to dry out.</p></li><li><p>Slowly add 140 Î¼l of cell suspension into the top well placing the pipette tip close to the main channel entrance (Figure 1B). Cells will start to flow through the main channel and reach the bottom well. To counter the flow and allow cells to settle in the main channel, pipette 110 Î¼l of cell suspension into the bottom well near the main channel entrance.</p><p><em>Note: As cells flow through the main channel of the seeded (somal) compartment, a fraction will settle down and extend axons into the opposing (axonal) compartment. It is normal for a majority of cells to settle in the seeded wells.</em> </p></li><li><p>Return all seeded devices to the 37 Â°C incubator and allow the cells to adhere overnight.</p></li><li><p>At ~16 to 18 h post-plating, change to medium containing 2 Î¼M AraC to discourage growth of non-neuronal cells and introduce an NGF gradient to promote axon growth into the axonal compartment. Cells should have adhered and started to extend out axonal processes by this time. To change medium, remove medium from the somal compartment (without drying out) and replace with 300 Î¼l of low-NGF medium containing AraC. Remove medium from the axonal compartment and replace with 200 Î¼l of complete medium containing AraC. Keep pipette tip pointing away from the main channel while changing medium.</p><p><em>Notes:</em> </p><ol class="npwthree"><li><p><em>To maintain fluidic isolation between the somal and axonal compartments, introduce hydrostatic pressure by establishing a difference in volume between the two compartments. In the above case, we introduced a 100 Î¼l volume difference between compartments to maintain a higher concentration of NGF in the axonal compartment. Solvent molecules slowly diffuse from the compartment with higher volume to the one with lower volume. Small molecules or virus added to the compartment with the lower volume remain isolated from the opposing compartment for at least 24 h.</em> </p></li><li><p><em>Never completely remove medium, dry out the main channels, or expose neurons to air.</em> </p></li></ol></li><li><p>Periodically check the composition of cells in the dishes under a bright-field microscope. Remove AraC and replace with complete medium maintaining the NGF gradient when most of the non-neuronal cells appear dead. We find that treatment with 2 Î¼M AraC for 48 h efficiently kills non-neuronal cells. However, the concentration of AraC (up to 4 Î¼M) and length of treatment should be empirically established.</p></li><li><p>Change medium every 3 days thereafter. Extension of processes into the axonal compartment can be observed 4 to 5 days post-plating and develop into a dense network by 8 days (Figure 1D). We usually conduct experiments between 8 to 12 days and have maintained DRG neurons in microfluidic devices up to 14 days post-plating.</p><p><em> Note: Synapse formation and maturity of DRG neurons in culture can be assessed using procedures described elsewhere (Joseph et al., 2010; Newberry et al., 2016).
