            <h1>Assessing Different Ways of <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> Spreading over Abiotic Surfaces</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Marco  Bartolini, Roberto Grau</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Surface-associate motility on biotic and abiotic environments is a key mechanism used by the model bacterium <em>Bacillus subtilis</em> and its closest relatives (<em>i.e.</em>, <em>B. amyloliquefaciens</em>, <em>B. thuringiensis</em>, <em>B. cereus</em>, <em>B. pumilus</em>) for surface colonization and spreading across surfaces. The study of this mechanism in a research, industrial or clinic laboratory is essential; however, precautions should be taken for the reproducibility of the results, for example, the procedure to inoculate the bacteria on the testing plate, the humidity of the plate and the agar concentration. In this protocol, we describe, using <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, how to perform these assays and, in addition, we show how by varying the agar concentration in the plate, you can make a first approximation of what type of motility has other bacterial species.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Bacteria were considered for many years as unicellular organisms that function and disperse individually. However, in recent years, a growing number of studies show that these microorganisms live in societies where they interact with each other or with higher organisms (PalkovÃ¡, 2004; Lombardia <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Lyons and Kolter, 2015; Clinton and Rumbaugh, 2016). These bacterial communities use different types of movements to migrate, adhere and spread over different surfaces, both biotic and abiotic (Kearns, 2010). This movement is related to the ability of bacteria to colonize a host in a beneficial or harmful way (pathogen) (Chaban <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Gao <em>et al.</em>, 2016). For example, these surface-associated movements allow the microorganism to move to the area of the root and leaf of a plant, where it can colonize and form biofilms, and thus avoid colonization by a phytopathogen (Hinsinger <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Vacheron <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Kan <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Bacteria move through various mechanisms across moist surfaces. Depending on the circumstances, the model spore-forming bacterium <em>B. subtilis</em> can colonize surfaces using flagellum-driven single cell based movement (swimming), flagellum-dependent multicellular spreading (swarming), or growth-powered passive surface translocation flagellum-independent (sliding) (Kearns, 2010; Grau <em>et al.</em>, 2015). The flagellar synthesis for swarming and swimming motility is carried out by the <em>hag</em> gene. On the other hand, The sliding type movement is dependent on the synthesis of exopolysaccharides (through the <em>EPS</em> operon) and the master sporulation regulator Spo0A (through the <em>spo0A</em> gene) (Kearns, 2010; Grau <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/><br/>Motility assays are widely used in applied and basic studies, both for human health and for agriculture. However, the detailed methods are generally not precise and difficult to reproduce. In this protocol, we show how to test the different types of spreading using <em>B. subtilis</em> as a model, which can be adapted to other bacterial genera. All the precautions that should be taken when carrying out this type of experiments are also described in detail.</p>

However, for long-term storage, they should be cryopreserved in cultures supplemented with 25% glycerol. The addition of glycerol stabilizes frozen bacteria, preventing damage of cell membranes and keeping cells alive. The cryopreserved </em><em>Bacillus</em><em> can be stored stably at -80 Â°C for several years. To do this, grow </em><em>B. subtilis</em><em> for 48 h at 37 Â°C in DSM broth with shaking (150 rpm) to obtain a high titer of spores per ml. Perform a thermal shock at 80 Â°C for 15 min to the grown culture (heat-treatment kills all vegetative bacteria that did not sporulate). This heat-treated culture is mixed in equal parts with a 50% glycerol solution (âsee Recipe 4â) and mixed gently. Freeze the tubes at -80 Â°C until use. In this way, the low temperature (-80 Â°C) and the intrinsic spore robustness will maintain the cryopreserved strain alive and viable for a long time period without affection of bacterial survival due to subsequent freeze and thaw cycles that you could perform in the future. To recover bacteria from your glycerol stock, open the tube and use a sterile loop or pipette tip to scrape some of the frozen bacteria off of the top. It is not needed to let the glycerol bacterial stock completely thaw. Always keep your glycerol bacterial stock on ice while the procedure is carried out. The biggest advantage of working with spores instead of vegetative is, apart from the greater stability over time of the spore, that the thermal treatment that is carried out (80 Â°C for 15 min) allows the elimination of possible microbial contaminants (that do not form spores) that could have grown or been introduced during handling bacterial cultures.</em> </li><li>Put 2 ml of sterile DSM broth in a sterile 150 x 20 mm-tube.

Add the corresponding antibiotic to the medium in case of using isogenic mutant carrying antibiotic resistance.<br/><em>Note: For the swarming and sliding experiments, the NCIB3610 strain was utilized instead of the JH642 strain, because the latter strain does not produce the biosurfactant surfactin (Grau </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2015) and therefore, it is unable to swarm or slide.</em> </li><li>Incubate at mid-log at 37 Â°C (O.D. 575 = 0.5) with shaking (175 rpm).

The humidity of the media is one of the factors to control: very little water will result in low motility, while too much humidity can allow the swimming motility in undesired conditions. To control the moisture content, the plates are all prepared with agar medium at a relatively low temperature (~ 50 Â°C), and made of the same thickness. This prevents water loss by condensation in the lid of the plate. Finally, the spreading plates are dried all together, for the same time (~ 1 h), and in the same drying equipment (</em><em>i.e.</em><em>, incubator at 37 Â°C). This procedure avoids, for example, that two plates have different degrees of humidity. The quality of the agar (</em><em>i.e.</em><em>, manufacturer) affects the test; we recommend not to vary the type of agar during reproduction or repetition of the tests.</em> </li><li><em>Always use fresh plates, prepared not longer than 6 h before to perform the assay.

Analysis of results. </strong>Type of <em>B. subtilis</em> motility based on the results obtained. These results can be validated through genetic analysis, for example gene inactivation of <em>hag</em> genes (involved in flagellum synthesis) to confirm or discard flagella-mediated motility or inactivation of <em>eps</em> genes (involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis) to confirm or discard sliding motility.<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>For </em><em>Bacillus</em><em>, these three types of motilities have been reported so far.</em> </li><li><em>Swarming (flagella-</em><em>hag</em><em>-dependent </em><em>EPS</em><em>-independent) and sliding (flagella-independent </em><em>EPS</em><em>-dependent) motilities can occur during development in the same bacterial colony. To know if these bacteria have one or both types of motilities, the following types of experiments can be performed. If you did not observe swimming (flagella-</em><em>hag</em><em>-dependent and </em><em>EPS</em><em>-independent) type motility but if it does occur in LB supplemented with 0.7% agar, you are facing a possible sliding (flagella-</em><em>hag</em><em>-independent and </em><em>EPS</em><em>-dependent) type motility. If you observed a proficient motility phenotype in LB supplemented with 0.3% and 0.7% agar concentrations, your strain may have one (sliding) or both types of motilities (sliding and swarming). In order to distinguish between swarming and sliding type motility, a mutation must be made that does not allow the synthesis of flagella (</em><em>i.e.</em><em>, genetic inactivation of the </em><em>hag</em><em> gene), since swarming is flagellar motility dependent, while the sliding is not. Another way to distinguish between swarming and sliding, is the gene inactivation of sliding proficiency (</em><em>i.e.</em><em>, gene inactivation of genes involved in </em><em>EPS</em><em> production that is essential for sliding, without affecting swarming proficiency). </em> </li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30394">### Data analysis</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>All experiments were performed using a randomized design.</li><li>The values shown are mean Â± SD of three independent times by quadruplicate.</li><li>Use the Studentâs <em>t</em>-test with a significance cut-off level of <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05 for comparisons between two groups.</li><li>Use the one-factor (ANOVA) variance analysis and correct by the post hoc Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons. </li><li>Use the one-factor (ANOVA) to test the null hypothesis that there were no significant differences in the mean of s.d. of the seven strains, followed by TukeyÂ´s post-hoc test. </li><li>All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30395">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Luria Bertani (LB) 1.5%<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 20 g LB broth and 15 g agar to 1 L of dH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>Autoclave at 121 Â°C, 1 atm, for 20 min</li><li>Store at room temperature</li></ol></li><li>Luria Bertani (LB) 0.3%<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 20 g LB broth and 3 g agar to 1 L of dH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>Autoclave at 121 Â°C, 1 atm, for 20 min</li><li>Store at room temperature</li></ol></li><li>Luria Bertani (LB) 0.7%<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 20 g LB broth and 7 g agar to 1 L of dH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>Autoclave at 121 Â°C, 1 atm, for 20 min</li><li>Store at room temperature</li></ol></li><li>50% glycerol<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 25 ml of pure glycerol (99.5 %) into 25 ml of dH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>Autoclave at 121 Â°C, 1 atm, for 20 min</li><li>Store at room temperature</li></ol></li><li>DSM broth<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 8 g nutrient broth, 1 g KCl and 0.25 g MgSO<sub>4</sub> heptahydrate to 1 L of dH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>Autoclave at 121 Â°C, 1 atm, for 20 min</li><li>Store at room temperature</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30396">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">The authors thank CONICET and FONCyT from Argentina, the Fulbright (Washington DC) and Pew (Philadelphia) foundations for their support and technical support.
