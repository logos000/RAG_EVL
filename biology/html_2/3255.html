            <h1>Organelle-associated rRNA Degradation</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jinliang  Huang, Geng   Wang</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cytosolic rRNAs are highly dynamic and can be degraded under conditions such as apoptosis, starvation and magnesium depletion. The degradation is also related to their specific localization, as fractions of cytosolic ribosomes are localized on the surfaces of intracellular organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Such localized translation facilitates translocation of nascent proteins into these organelles co-translationally, contributing to fast responses to cellular stresses and precise regulations of the organelle. Here, we describe a protocol to establish the <em>in organello</em> system to investigate rRNA degradation on mitochondrial outer membrane or ER. The protocol consists of organelle isolation, rRNA degradation on organelles and agarose gel electrophoresis to examine the remaining rRNAs.</p>
            <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> <em>In organello</em>, Ribosomal RNA, Cytosolic rRNAs, rRNA degradation, Localized translation, Mitochondrion-associated ribosomes, ER-associated ribosomes</p>
            <h2>Background</h2><p>Cytosolic ribosomes, where protein translation takes place, have been shown to be localized to specific membranes within the cells, such as ER (Reid and Nicchitta, 2012) and mitochondrial outer membrane (Kellems and Butow, 1972), which couples protein synthesis to protein targeting and translocation (Mukhopadhyay <em>et al.</em>, 2004). Such localized translation reduces the protein transportation cost and avoids mistargeting (Lesnik <em>et al.</em>, 2015). In addition, localized translation contributes to fast responses to unfolded protein stress on ER (Reid <em>et al.</em>, 2014) and modulates protein translation within mitochondria (Dennerlein <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Richter-Dennerlein <em>et al.</em>, 2016). The binding between cytosolic ribosomes and mitochondrial outer membrane have been previously investigated, and GTP, specific targeting sequences (Crowley and Payne, 1998) and MDI (Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2016) are all shown to be involved. However, how the mitochondrial outer membrane-associated cytosolic rRNAs are regulated by different conditions or mitochondrial proteins remains unclear, and how the ER-associated ribosomes differ from other pools of cytosolic ribosomes is not well studied. To gain a better understanding of these processes and their regulations in mammals, <em>in organello</em> systems are needed. However, no such systems have been established. Here, we describe a protocol to study <em>in organello</em> rRNA degradation on mitochondria or ER. The sample preparation procedures are minimized to reduce the operational errors. However, since this is an <em>in organello</em> system, the rRNA degradation observed may not reflect the real complexity in the cell. Particular caution needs to be taken in interpreting the results.</p>

Store one tube at the -80 Â°C freezer as the first time point (0 min). Transfer the other 2 tubes to 37 Â°C in a heating block. Incubate the two samples for 30 and 60 min respectively. At each time point, transfer one tube to -80 Â°C freezer. Store the samples at -80 Â°C for at least 15 min before the next step.<br/><em>Note: For quality control, prepare another set of the samples and perform the same degradation steps. Then mix the samples with an equal volume of 2x protein loading buffer with DTT, and heat them at 95 Â°C for 5 min. Separate the proteins in the samples on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After running the gel at 150 V for 60 min, transfer the proteins in the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane at 450 mA for 70 min and blot the membrane by standard western blotting method. In brief, incubate the membrane at RT for 1 h in 5% skim milk, probe it with primary antibody in 1x TBS-T at RT for 1 h, wash 4 times with 1x TBS-T (5 min/time), incubate with secondary antibody in 1x TBS-T at RT for 1 h, and then wash 4 times with 1x TBS-T (5 min/time). Use Luminol/Enhancer solution for detection of the proteins. Marker proteins used for mitochondria and ER fractions are Mortalin (73.7 kDa) and Calnexin (~68 kDa) respectively. The actual position for Mortalin on a gel is between 70 and 100 kDa, and the position for Calnexin is around 100 kDa. </em> </li><li>Take out samples from the -80 Â°C freezer and add 20 Î¼l of 2x DNA-SDS-EDTA buffer.

Open software ImageJ. Select âRectangularâ tool (this is default choice), and draw a rectangle covering the RNA band at the first time point. Press shortcut âCtrl + Mâ to measure the band intensity. Move the same rectangle horizontally to RNA band at the second or third time point, and then press shortcut âCtrl + Mâ to measure the band intensity. After all the time points are measured, move the same rectangle to a typical background area, and then press shortcut âCtrl + Mâ to measure background intensity. <br/>  Calculation method: Measure the RNA signal by subtracting the background intensity from the band intensity to get the absolute intensity of each band. Set the signal at the first time point as 100, and calculate the second and third ones by dividing the absolute signal of the RNA band to that of the first time point. <br/>  Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired <em>t</em>-tests (n = 3); *<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05, **<em>P</em> &lt; 0.01, ***<em>P </em>&lt; 0.001, ****<em>P </em>&lt; 0.0001.
