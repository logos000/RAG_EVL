            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Rhodopsin is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates vision under dim light. Upon light exposure, rhodopsin is phosphorylated at multiple serine and threonine sites at its carboxyl-terminus by rhodopsin kinase (GRK1). This, in turn, reduces its ability to activate the visual G-protein transducin. Binding of light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin by arrestin (ARR1) fully terminates the catalytic activity of rhodopsin. Quantification of the levels of the differentially phosphorylated rhodopsin species provides definitive information about the role of phosphorylated rhodopsin in visual functions. Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) is a technique which is used to separate ampholytic components, such as proteins, based on their isoelectric point (pI). It is a useful technique used to distinguish protein isoforms and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, deamination, and acetylation, due to their effects on the proteinâs pI. Isoelectric Focusing can provide high resolution of differentially phosphorylated forms of a protein. Though other techniques such as kinase activity assays, phospho-specific antibodies, western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), radiolabeling and mass spectrometry are used to detect and quantify protein phosphorylation, IEF is a simple and cost-effective method to quantify rhodopsin phosphorylation, as it can readily detect individual phosphorylated forms. <br/><br/>Here we provide a detailed protocol for determining phosphorylated rhodopsin species using the Isoelectric Focusing technique.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Rhodopsin is a seven-helix transmembrane protein covalently linked to a chromophore, 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal, which acts as a powerful antagonist, holding rhodopsin in its inactive state. Photon absorption isomerizes the retinal from <em>cis</em> to <em>trans</em> which then triggers conformational changes in the protein moiety into a catalytically active form. Activated rhodopsin facilitates GTP-GDP exchange in the visual G-protein transducin. Transducin-GTP binds and releases the inhibitory constraint of the gamma subunit on phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6), which then hydrolyzes the diffusible second messenger cGMP, leading to closure of cation cGMP gated channels localized in the plasma membrane. This collective of reactions, called the phototransduction cascade, provides the first steps of vision and is one of the best characterized G-protein signaling pathways (Molday and Moritz, 2015). <br/><br/>Like other GPCRs, rapid quenching of receptor activity depends on phosphorylation by a receptor kinase and subsequent binding of arrestin. During rhodopsin deactivation, rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) sequentially phosphorylates six serine/threonine residues contained within residues 334-343 near the C-terminus of mouse rhodopsin: <u>S</u>A<u>T</u>A<u>S</u>K<u>T</u>E<u>TS</u>. These multiple phosphorylation sites confer reproducibility of the rodâs quantal response to single photon absorption (Mendez <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Doan <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Azevedo <em>et al.</em>, 2015) which is essential for our ability to see under dim light conditions when photons are sparse. In the absence of ARR1, rhodopsin phosphorylation alone decreases the efficiency of transducin activation (Xu <em>et al.</em>, 1997). Even single and double phosphorylations can decrease rhodopsinâs catalytic activity by half (Mendez <em>et al.</em>, 2000). Therefore, a reliable methodology to quantify rhodopsin phosphorylation will provide important information on how this common post-translational modification affects phototransduction, and thus visual performance. <br/><br/>Traditionally, the most common method used to detect protein phosphorylation involved the use of radiolabeling. Phosphorylation of rhodopsin by GRK1 has been determined using radiolabeled [Î³-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 1997). Greene <em>et al.</em> (1995) have also shown kinetic and structural analysis of the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by protein kinase C. However, the limitations of the radiolabeling method include sample variability and an inability to quantify pre-bound unlabeled phosphate. Reverse phase column chromatography has been used to separate phospho- and non-phospho mouse rhodopsin peptides, and to study the kinetics of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (Ohguro and Palczewski, 1995). Phospho-specific antibodies are also routinely used to analyze key targets in normal and disease states. Though useful for initial studies, phospho-specific antibodies fail to detect unphosphorylated species; hence stoichiometric measurements cannot be made. Production of quality phospho-specific antibodies is time-consuming, costly, and also requires prior knowledge of specific phosphorylation sites (Arur and Schedl, 2014). <br/><br/>Mass spectrometry has become a highly sensitive nonradioactive method to analyze protein phosphorylation. Electrospray mass spectrometry has been used to identify sequential phosphorylation of rhodopsin at multiple sites <em>in vitro</em> (Ohguro <em>et al.</em>, 1993) and <em>in vivo</em> (Kennedy <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Lee <em>et al.</em>, 2002). However, major challenges in analyzing protein phosphorylation using mass spectrometry include access to the instrumentation and the possible high cost associated with using the instruments through core facilities. Additionally, mass accuracy of post-translational modifications depends on the resolution of the mass spectrometer used. Some of the intrinsic limitations are: a) mass spectrometry is sensitive in a particular m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) range; b) protease cleavage efficiencies vary for different proteins and different domains of same protein; and c) cleaved peptides have different ionization and detection efficiencies (Kim <em>et al.</em>, 2016). <br/><br/>Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) is a high-resolution technique used for separating charged molecules, usually proteins or peptides, on the basis of their isoelectric point (pI) within a continuous pH gradient. pI is defined as the pH at which the molecule has no charge. Separation is achieved by initially establishing a stable pH gradient along the length of the gel using ampholytes. The sample components then travel through the pH gradient under an electric field until their individual charges reach zero. Proteins move towards the electrode with an opposite charge. The gradient is set up so that negatively charged molecules migrate towards decreasing pH, whereas positively charged molecules move towards increasing pH. For this technique, a low concentration polyacrylamide or agarose gel is used as it is only a stabilizing medium and does not participate in the sample separation. IEF can readily detect individual phosphorylated forms, as every additional phosphate increases the negative charge on rhodopsin protein, and hence causes a shift in pI (Berry <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Here we describe a simple and cost-effective method to determine phosphorylated rhodopsin species using Isoelectric Focusing (IEF) in a horizontal gel format followed by immunoblot detection.</p>

The intensity, duration and wavelength of light is chosen so as to bleach (photoactivate) a specified fraction of rhodopsin.<br/>The components that comprise the optical system used for bleaching were all purchased from Thorlabs. Thorlabs components are modular and can be used in a variety of combinations to align all of the optical components. Intense white light is provided by a 6V 100 W tungsten-halogen lamp of the sort normally connected to laboratory light microscopes. The light source used in the Figure 1 (in-house setup) was taken from a discarded Zeiss microscope, but an illuminator from any other microscope manufacturer will serve the purpose as well. The components of the bleaching apparatus are mounted in the light path on an aluminum plate (Thorlabs; MB1218), which has an array of Â¼â-20 threaded holes for affixing the components. The components are lined up in a linear fashion to allow adjustment of wavelength and intensity of the bleaching beam. First in line is a filter wheel (Thorlabs; CFW6) with positions for 5 one-inch diameter neutral density filters. The following neutral density filters are used:<br/>NE05B-A 25.0 mm diameter absorptive ND filter ND = 0.5 <br/>NE10B-A 25.0 mm diameter absorptive ND filter ND = 1.0<br/>NE20B-A 25.0 mm diameter absorptive ND filter ND = 2.0<br/>NE30B-A 25.0 mm diameter absorptive ND filter ND = 3.0<br/>NE40B-A 25.0 mm diameter absorptive ND filter ND = 4.0<br/>These filters are mounted in a 1-inch mounting hole in each of the 5 spaces in the wheel. Next in line are two cage plates (Thorlabs; CP02) each with a 1-inch diameter hole to accept optic components. The first component is a 1-inch diameter 500 nm (green) interference filter (Thorlabs; FD1G). This filter can be changed for another which has different band pass characteristics, depending on the sensitivity of the photoreceptors under study. Such filters are available from Thorlabs. The second component is a 1-inch diameter plano convex lens of focal length 5 cm (Thorlabs; LA1951-A). These two components are connected together by intermediate optical tubes (Thorlabs; SM1L10). The second of these two cage plates is connected to a cage cube-mounted non-polarizing beam splitter (Thorlabs; CCM1-BS013) that contains a mirror to direct light vertically to a 4 mm aperture, over which the retina in physiological solution is placed. A variety of miscellaneous mechanical rods and brackets for mounting components to the base plate can also be purchased from Thorlabs. These include a mounting base (Thorlabs; BA2, BA1S) which connects to the base plate, mounting rods (Thorlabs; ER2, ER3) and mounting posts (Thorlabs; TR2, TR1) that connect components together. Normally, a thin opaque plastic plate or cardboard card is placed between the colored filter and the lens to act as a shutter. Because relatively long times of light exposure are normally used, removal and subsequent insertion of the card provides light stimulation of sufficient accuracy.<br/>The photostimulator can be constructed using the following parts (Figure 1):<ol class="npwthree"><li>Tungsten-halogen lamp (Thorlabs, catalog number: QTH10B)</li><li>Aluminum plate (Thorlabs, catalog number: MB1218) </li><li>Filter wheel with positions for neutral density filters (Thorlabs, catalog number: CFW6)</li><li>Neutral density filters (Thorlabs, catalog numbers: NE05B-A; NE10B-A; NE20B-A; NE30B-A; NE40B-A)</li><li>Cage plates (Thorlabs, catalog number: CP02)</li><li>Interference filter (Thorlabs, catalog number: FD1G)</li><li>Plano convex lens (Thorlabs, catalog number: LA1951-A)</li><li>Intermediate optical tube (Thorlabs, catalog number: SM1L10) </li><li>Cage cube-mounted non-polarizing beam splitter (Thorlabs, catalog number: CCM1-BS013)</li><li>Mounting base (Thorlabs, catalog numbers: BA2; BA1S)</li><li>Mounting rods (Thorlabs, catalog numbers: ER2; ER3)</li><li>Mounting posts (Thorlabs, catalog number: TR1) </li></ol></li><li>A black, light-tight Delrin plastic box (Figure 2) <br/>Used for incubation of the bleached retinal tissue.

Minimize handling and manipulation of samples.</em><br/>Rhodopsin is a chromoprotein made up of opsin and 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal. When the eye is exposed to light, the 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal component of rhodopsin is converted to all-<em>trans</em>-retinal, resulting in a fundamental change in the configuration of the rhodopsin. The change in configuration causes opsin to dissociate from retinal, resulting in bleaching during which rhodopsin is deactivated through receptor phosphorylation. Light-exposed retinae contain a mixed population of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated rhodopsin. Complete dark adaptation can only occur when all rhodopsin has been dephosphorylated, a process that requires &gt; 3 h in complete darkness. Variable time periods are used to capture differentially phosphorylated species. Dark adapted retinae not exposed to light is the control as all rhodopsin species are unphosphorylated.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Perform all the procedures involved in dissection, preparation, and Isoelectric Focusing under infrared light or dim red light. We use Delta 1 Brightlab Universal Red Junior Safelight 11 W bulb in our dark room as the source of dim red light. Rhodopsin phosphorylation can be examined by performing experiments both <em>in situ</em> in intact mice or in retinae that had been isolated and then incubated for various times in darkness. Processing of dark-adapted tissue serves as a control for bleached samples. All the mice are dark adapted overnight before exposure to light.</li><li>For each experimental condition, sacrifice mice under dim red light or infrared light by cervical dislocation. Mice can be of any strain or gender and at 3-12 weeks of age at the time of experiment. Wild-type strain, like C57BL/6J, is included for comparison.</li><li>To examine rhodopsin phosphorylation in isolated retinae, first dissect the retina from the eye (Video 1). After euthanizing, place the mouse on a flat clean surface and protrude the eye out by applying pressure around the socket. Place the curved tweezers underneath the eyeball and gently pinch the eyeball using your dominant hand. Hold scalpel in your nondominant hand and gently cut the cornea from top to bottom (dorsal to ventral). Put pressure under the bottom of the eye using curved tweezers and gently pinch so that the lens pops out. Remove the lens gently using tweezers and continue to put pressure from the bottom to pull out the retina. Place the retina in buffered Amesâ medium (1.9 g/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub> bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) (Ames and Nesbett, 1981). Phosphorylation determination is made under five different experimental conditions: a) Freeze the dark adapted retinae and store it at -80 Â°C (Dark), b) Dark adapt the retinae, bleach and immediately freeze and store at -80 Â°C (0 h), c) Dark adapt the retinae, bleach, incubate in darkness for 1 h, immediately freeze and store at -80 Â°C (1 h), d) Dark adapt the retinae, bleach, incubate in darkness for 2 h, immediately freeze and store at -80 Â°C (2 h), e) Dark adapt retinae, bleach, incubate in darkness for 3 h, immediately freeze and store at -80 Â°C (3 h). Further process these samples for IEF analysis. For bleaching, place the retinae in buffered Amesâ medium (1.9 g/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub> bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> /5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in the center of a 5 mm diameter âOâ ring affixed to the center of a 3 cm plastic Petri dish. This dish is centered on the stage of a calibrated photostimulator, as illustrated in Figure 1. <br/><br/><!--video3300-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3300-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3300-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3300/3300-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="donotsetwh" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.

Immunoblot quantification of rhodopsin phosphorylation using ImageJ.</strong> A. Immunoblot of rhodopsin carried out after Isoelectric Focusing of rhodopsin from solubilized mouse retinae. Rhodopsin is multiply phosphorylated <em>in vitro</em> in intact rods and <em>in vivo</em>, and the amount of rhodopsin phosphorylation is indicated by the multiple bands representing differently phosphorylated species of rhodopsin. 0P corresponds to unphosphorylated rhodopsin. The number next to âPâ (1P, 2P, 3P, 4P, 5P and 6P) corresponds to the number of covalently added phosphate groups to rhodopsin. B. Quantification of the intensity of the band using ImageJ. Screen shot of the inverted image (TIFF format) is shown. The bands are selected using the rectangle icon and the values are measured under the âAnalyzeâ command. </li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28423">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz">To quantify the signal from the phosphorylated species on the immunoblot, the image of the gel is saved as a grayscale TIFF file. The image is inverted using any imaging software so that the background is black and the bands from the gel are white. The inverted image is imported into ImageJ (Fiji). Alternatively, the original grayscale image can be inverted using ImageJ under the âEditâ command. The bands are selected using the rectangle, and the pixel values are measured under the âAnalyzeâ command (command+M). The mean intensity value is recorded for each band. Signals from all bands within a sample are summed to provide the value for total rhodopsin for that sample, and the fractions for each phosphorylated species are calculated by dividing the signal for that species over the total signal.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28424">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Buffer A (Homogenization buffer)<br/>25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5<br/>100 mM EDTA<br/>50 mM NaF<br/>5 mM Adenosine<br/>1 mM PMSF<br/>1x Protease inhibitor<br/>Milli-Q water</li><li>Buffer B (Regeneration buffer)<br/>10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5<br/>0.1 mM EDTA<br/>50 mM NaF<br/>5 mM Adenosine<br/>1 mM PMSF<br/>1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> <br/>2% BSA<br/>1x Protease inhibitor<br/>Milli-Q Water</li><li>Buffer C (Solubilization buffer)<br/>20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5<br/>0.1 mM EDTA<br/>50 mM NaF<br/>5 mM Adenosine<br/>1 mM PMSF<br/>1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> <br/>10 mM NaCl<br/>1% n-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltoside (DDM)<br/>1 mM DTT<br/>1x Protease Inhibitor<br/>Milli-Q water</li><li>11-<em>cis</em>-retinal stock<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Both the stock and powder are wrapped in light-tight aluminum foil and stored at -80 Â°C</li><li>The dissolved retinal stock is stable at -80 Â°C for 3 months whereas the retinal in powder form is more stable.</li><li>To make a working stock solution, shake a small amount of 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal powder (&lt; 1 mg) in a microfuge tube under dim red light conditions and dissolve it in absolute ethanol (100-200 Î¼l).</li><li>Perform UV spectrometry with appropriate dilution (typically 1:500-1:1,000) using absolute ethanol as a blank. </li></ol><br/>11-<em>cis</em>-retinal concentration (<em>c</em>) is calculated as: <br/><br/> <img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="35" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715223839_6842.jpg" width="72"/><br/><br/>where,<br/><em>l</em> = 1 cm path length<br/><em>Îµ</em><sub>380</sub> = 24,900 M<sup>â1</sup> cm<sup>â1</sup><br/><br/>Prepare a concentrated stock solution of ~5 to 10 mM of 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal to avoid exposing the protein to greater than 1% absolute ethanol during reconstitution procedure.<br/><br/>9-<em>cis</em>-retinal stock<br/>The procedure is similar to the preparation of 11-<em>cis</em>-retinal stock. 9-<em>cis</em>-retinal concentration (<em>c</em>) is calculated as:<br/><br/> <img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="35" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190715/20190715223924_1127.jpg" width="75"/><br/><br/>where,<br/><em>l</em> = 1 cm path length<br/><em>Îµ</em><sub>373</sub> = 36,100 M<sup>â1</sup> cm<sup>â1</sup> </li><li>IEF Gel solution (volume = 20 ml)<br/>This recipe is sufficient for casting one gel of 160 x 140 x 1 mm<br/><table border="0" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="ke-zeroborder" style="width:450px;"><tbody><tr><td>40% Acrylamide solution<br/></td><td>2.5 ml<br/></td></tr><tr><td>1% n-dodecyl-Î²-D-maltoside (DDM)<br/></td><td>0.2 g<br/></td></tr><tr><td>13.33% glycerol<br/></td><td>2.67 ml<br/></td></tr><tr><td>Pharmalyte pH 2.5-5<br/></td><td>0.76 ml<br/></td></tr><tr><td>Pharmalyte pH 5-8<br/></td><td>0.508 ml<br/></td></tr><tr><td>Ammonium persulfate (22.8 mg/ml)<br/></td><td>0.2 ml<br/></td></tr><tr><td>TEMED<br/></td><td>0.02 ml<br/></td></tr></tbody></table>Make up the volume to 20 ml with water</li><li>1x Phosphate buffered saline (PBS)<br/>137 mM NaCl <br/>10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub><br/>1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><br/>2.7 mM KCl<br/>Adjust the pH to 7.4</li><li>1x Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST)<br/>50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6<br/>150 mM NaCl<br/>0.1% Tween 20<br/></li></ol><p class="ppzz"><em>Note: Recipes 1, 2, 3 and 5 should always be made fresh.
