            <h1>Preparation and Manipulation of Olfactory Epithelium Explant Cultures for Measurement of the Mechanical Tension of Individual Axons Using the Biomembrane Force Probe</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Coralie Fouquet, Alain Trembleau</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In this paper, we describe a protocol allowing measurement of the mechanical tension of individual axons grown <em>ex vivo</em> from neural tissue explants. This protocol was developed with primary cultures of olfactory epithelium explants from embryonic (E13.5) mice. It includes a detailed description of explant dissection and culture, as well as the main steps of the procedure for axon tension measurement using the previously established Biomembrane Force Probe.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The development of neural networks involves the growth and navigation of axons toward their target. It has recently been shown that neural network development depends not only on molecular cues acting on the developing axon, but also on extrinsic and intrinsic mechanical forces (Reviewed in Franze <em>et al.</em>, 2013, Franze, 2013, Gangatharan <em>et al.</em>, 2018). In the course of a study analyzing the mechanisms of fasciculation/defasciculation of olfactory sensory axons, we discovered that the mechanical tension of axons plays a critical role in regulating these processes (Å mÃ­t <em>et al.</em>, 2017a). The mechanical tension of PC-12 axons or dorsal root ganglia neurites, as well as motor neuron axons in <em>Drosophila</em> embryo, had previously been measured using calibrated needles or microelectromechanical systems (Dennerll <em>et al.</em>, 1988 and 1989; Rajagopalan <em>et al.</em>, 2010). These approaches, however, appeared inappropriate for olfactory axons characterized by a very small diameter (200 nm), mostly because physical contact of the manipulator with the substrate would be inevitable, and would lead to inaccurate force measurements. To assess the mechanical tension of these thin axons, we developed a new protocol using the Biomembrane Force Probe (BFP) technique, in which a red blood cell is used as a force transducer (Evans <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Gourier <em>et al.</em>, 2008), adapted here for the first time to axon manipulations <em>ex vivo</em>. In our protocol, live axons are biotinylated, then streptavidin-coated glass microbeads (3 Î¼m diameter) are attached to the biotinylated axons; these beads are then manipulated with a biotinylated red blood cell held by an aspirating micropipette (Å mÃ­t <em>et al.</em>, 2017a and 2017b). The force with which the bead is manipulated can be calculated by measuring the deformation of the red blood cell, using our recently developed software (Å mÃ­t <em>et al.</em>, 2017b).</p>

Therefore, in the protocol below, we will not describe the aspects that are already detailed in that technical publication. We will, however present, the detailed protocol and parameters used for tension measurement of olfactory axons.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Micropipette preparation<br/>Micropipettes are prepared as described in Gourier <em>et al.</em> (2008), as follows:<ol class="npwthree"><li>Elongate a borosilicate glass capillary using the micropipette puller.</li><li>Using the microforge, as described in Gourier <em>et al.</em> (2008), adjust the micropipette diameter to give an aperture (inner diameter) of about 2 Âµm, to optimize the holding of the red blood cell by the pipette.</li><li>Fill the micropipette with culture medium.</li><li>Fix the micropipette to the micromanipulator mounted on the stage of the microscope and connected to the homemade manometers (Gourier <em>et al.</em>, 2008).</li><li>Immerse the tip of the pipette in a drop of Solution C deposited on a glass slide for 1 h, allowing the saturation of the pipette glass with BSA.</li></ol></li><li>Biomembrane force probe assembly<ol class="npwthree"><li>Remove the glass slide with the drop of BSA solution from the microscope stage.</li><li>Transport the dish containing the biotinylated explant cultures from the incubator to the microscope stage.</li><li>Measure the micropipette internal diameter, using the 40x objective and the CCD camera.</li><li>Add the steptavidin-coated beads to the culture medium and allow them to settle for 3-5 min. Some of them will attach to axons.</li><li>Add biotinylated Red Blood Cells (RBC) to the culture medium.</li><li>Catch an RBC floating in the culture with the micropipette, via gentle aspiration (ÎP = 200-250 Pa).</li><li>Position this captured RBC in contact with a bead attached to an axon and wait at least 2 min.</li><li>Check that the manipulated bead remains attached to both the axon and RBC, by slowly moving the pipette backwards and forwards. If the bead detaches from either the axon or the RBC, repeat the procedure with another bead attached to an axon.</li><li>In the favorable cases where the bead remains attached to both the axon and the RBC, proceed with the acquisition of data for tension measurement as follows:<ol class="npwfour"><li>The whole manipulation should be continuously recorded using the CCD camera.</li><li>Pull the micropipette a short distance, induce elongation of the RBC; this often results in lateral deflection of the axon. An equilibrium is rapidly reached between the force induced by the probe and the transverse projection of the reaction force of the axon axial tension.</li><li>Pull the micropipette again, a bit further, to induce an additional deformation of both the RBC and axon (a second equilibrium is reached).</li><li>Repeat gradual force application (through pulling) to acquire several equilibrium stages with different axon deflections, until the bead detaches from the RBC.</li></ol></li></ol><em>Note: Axons can be manipulated by pulling (as described above) and/or pushing, allowing the acquisition of more equilibrium stages. Detailed illustrations of olfactory axon tension measurement are provided in Å mÃ­t </em><em>et al.</em><em> (2017a and 2017b).</em> </li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27451">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz">The video data obtained using this protocol allow the extraction of two key parameters necessary to calculate axon tension: 1) the deformation of the RBC (used here as a force transducer), allowing the calculation of the force (F) with which the bead (and hence the axon) is manipulated; and 2) the deflection of the axon, allowing the calculation of axon tension as a function of the applied force F. At equilibrium, the pulling force F is balanced by the projection of the axon tension (T) in the transverse direction, 2TsinÎ´, where Î´ is the angle of deflection of the axon (Å mÃ­t <em>et al.</em>, 2017a and 2017b). <br/>  The procedures for assessing these two key parameters, as well as to calculate axon tension, are detailed in one software technical paper (Å mÃ­t <em>et al.</em>, 2017b), and in a research paper (Å mÃ­t <em>et al.</em>, 2017a), both in open access. Therefore, the data analyses will not be described further here.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27452">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Poly-L-Lysine was used in the experiments described in Å mÃ­t <em>et al.</em>, 2017a and 2017b. Because Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) is thought to be less toxic for the cultures, we performed experiments using PDL 10 Âµg/ml, and observed that it is suitable for explant adhesion to the coverslip.</li><li>PBS 1x 0.06% Glucose can be used for embryo dissection to reduce costs but L-15 medium preserves viability and must be used at least for explant storage. </li><li>The microscalpel allows a nice cutting edge, preserves the integrity of the explant and reducing cell death. If this tool is not available, replace it with a 26 G needle at the tip of a 1 ml syringe.</li><li>The EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin is also available by weight (100 mg). We find that using the No-Weigh Format enhances reproducibility.</li><li>DMEM/F-12 already contains 15 mM HEPES, but if cell culture requires extended periods of manipulation outside of a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, add 10 mM HEPES in the culture 1 h before processing. </li><li>To maintain the cultures at 37 Â°C during transport from the CO<sub>2</sub> incubator to the micromanipulation laboratory, we stored the Petri dishes in a polystyrene box containing flasks of water preincubated at 37 Â°C. </li><li>Streptavidin-coated beads prepared as in (Gourier <em>et al.</em>, 2008) can be replaced by a commercial version: ProActive<sup>Â®</sup> Microspheres, Streptavidin Polymeric: 3 Âµm diameter, CP01N-1, Bangs Laboratories, Inc., Polysciences Europe GmbH.
