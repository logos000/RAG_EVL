            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>For years, the mammary gland serves as a perfect example to study the self-renew and differentiation of adult stem cells, and the regulatory mechanisms of these processes as well. To assess the function of given genes and/or other factors on stemness of mammary cells, several <em>In vitro</em> assays were developed, such as mammospheres formation assay, detection of stem cell markers by mRNA expression or flow cytometry and so on. However, the capacity of reconstruction of whole mount in the cleared fat pad of recipient female mice is a golden standard to estimate the stemness of the cells. Here we described a step-by-step protocol for <em>in vivo</em> mammary gland formation assay, including preparation of âclearedâ recipients and mammary cells for implantation, the surgery process and how to assess the experimental results. Combined with manipulation of mammary cells via gene editing and /or drug treatment, this protocol could be very useful in the researches of mammary stem cells and mammary development.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>As one of the most typical organ of mammals, the mammary gland (MG) is an exocrine gland and responsible for lactation. The development of MG is under the control of certain sexual hormones, whose levels precisely regulate the structure, cellular composition and functional changes of MG in different developmental stages (Hennighausen and Robinson, 2005). Many genetic and environmental factors are involved in the regulation of mammary stem cells and the MG development. To study the functions and mechanisms of these factors, several methods have been developed, especially for the assessment of stemness of mammary cells. Previous studies demonstrated that only the basal cells instead of luminal cells of MG are able to reconstruct the epithelial tree in the cleared fat pads of recipient female mice, indicating the mammary stem cells only exist in the basal lineage (Van Keymeulen <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Later, many studies including ours, uncovered several markers for mammary stem cells (Prater <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Sun <em>et al.</em>, 2018), whose function in stemness maintenance was confirmed by the <em>in vivo</em> MG formation assay. In this protocol, we described in detail how to prepare the donor mammary cells, how to remove the endogenous epithelia from the fad pads of recipients female mice, how to perform the implantation, as well as how to assess the experimental results. Besides of verifying mammary stem cell markers, this protocol could be also very useful in other researches regarding mammary stem cells and mammary development when combined with manipulation of mammary cells via gene editing, gene overexpression or knockdown, and/or drug treatment.<br/></p>
