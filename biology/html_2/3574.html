            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The binding interactions of PD-1 and PD-L1 have been studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) over the past few years, but these investigations resulted in controversy regarding the values of the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) (Freeman <em>et al.</em>, 2000). MST is a powerful new method for the quantitative analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) with low sample consumption. The technique is based on the movement of molecules along microscopic temperature gradients, and it detects changes in their hydration shell, charge or size. One binding partner is fluorescently labeled, while the other binding partner remains label-free. We used a protocol that allows the determination of the binding affinity by MST without purification of the target protein from the cell lysate. The application of this MST method to PD-1-eGFP and PD-L1-eGFP expressed in CHO-K1 cells allowed us, for the first time, to determine the affinity of the complex formed between PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 during tumor escape. The protocol has a variety of potential applications for studying the interactions of proteins with small molecules.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The identification of compounds that might be able to modulate the affinity of the complex formed between PD-1 and PD-L1 represents a major advance in the development of new treatments targeting immune escape for oncology. This protocol involves the overexpression of an eGFP fusion protein, which is then extracted from the cell lysate, enabling the determination of the affinity constant between PD-1 and PD-L1 without any purification steps. Thus, the development of this protocol required the production of eGFP fusion proteins. This protocol was designed to quantitatively accelerate the characterization of protein interactions by avoiding tedious purification steps. This protocol could also be used to perform high-throughput screening with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to evaluate the ability of these recently developed molecules to modulate the affinity of the PD-1 protein for its ligand, as the small-molecule âblocking pathwayâ represents a major challenge for the development of new strategies targeting immune escape for oncology.<br/><br/>Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a biophysical technique that measures the strength of the interaction between two molecules by detecting variations in the fluorescence signal as a result of an IR laser-induced temperature change. The range of the variation in the fluorescence signal correlates with the binding of a ligand to the fluorescent target. Overall, MST is based on the movement of a fluorescent molecule within a temperature gradient. MST also has broad applications at concentrations ranging from picomolar to molar and involves very little sample consumption, requiring only a few microliters; in addition, no immobilization of the protein of interest is required. You can either add a fluorescent tag to your protein of interest or exploit the intrinsic fluorescence of the target. In any case, one binding partner is fluorescent, while the other binding partner remains label-free. MST has also been used to characterize protein-small molecule interactions such as those involving aptamers (Entzian and Schubert, 2016) and PD-L1 inhibitors by BMS (Ganesan <em>et al.</em>, 2019) or for high-throughput screening to identify hits (Rainard <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Here, we describe a protocol using MST to determine the binding affinity of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex, which is involved in tumor escape processes, without purification of the target protein from cell lysates (Khavrutskii <em>et al.</em>, 2013). This method requires the overexpression of fluorescent proteins in CHO-K1 cells and describes the optimal conditions for determining the dissociation constant. The protocol has a variety of potential applications for studying the interactions of these proteins with small molecules and demonstrates that MST is a valuable method for studying the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.</p>

The action of trypsin must be stopped by adding complete medium. A volume of 1.5 ml of 0.25% trypsin was introduced into the flask, which was then placed in an incubator (5 min at 37 Â°C). It is possible to assist the detachment by gently shaking the box. The action of trypsin was then stopped. A volume of 3.5 ml of supplemented complete medium was added to the flask. The cells were carefully homogenized by pipetting up and down. The volume of cell suspension and the volume of medium to be introduced into each flask were calculated depending on how many cells were needed to perform the MST experiments. The flasks were then placed in the incubator at 37 Â°C. Every two days, the culture medium was replaced, and the cells were observed. The subculture rate was adapted according to the growth rate of the cell line used.</li><li>Subculturing/passaging of cells immediately before the plateau is reached, when the cells are still growing exponentially, will result in improved overall cell viability and yield cells that are less aggregated, and this will shorten the lag time. The process does not have to be exact. It involves an estimation within a range. The cells should be between 50% and 100% confluent, which will become easier to estimate as more experience is gained in culturing cells. If in doubt, subculturing cells at between 60% and 90% confluency is best.<br/><br/></li></ol></li><li>Cell transfection<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Transfect the cells with the Cell Line Nucleofector<sup>Â®</sup> Kit T Program U-023 and the pcDNA3.1 Hygro plasmid expressing PD-1-eGFP.

Typically, a serial 1:1 dilution is performed by transferring one volume of ligand solution into an equal volume of buffer, mixing, and repeating these steps. In this way, the ligand concentration is reduced by 50% for each dilution step (Figure 2).</li><li>Never prepare less than 20 Î¼l of sample. Otherwise, the probability of encountering problems due to evaporation, adsorption of the sample material to the plastic micro reaction tubes and pipetting errors is increased.</li><li>Never prepare small volumes (<em>e.g.</em>, 20 Î¼l) in large micro reaction tubes (<em>e.g.</em>, 500 Î¼l or more). The high surface-to-volume ratio leads to surface adsorption even for well-behaved proteins. Always use the smallest micro reaction tubes possible (<em>e.g.</em>, PCR tubes).</li><li>Always mix very small volumes with a pipette. Do not vortex. Do not flip the tube.</li><li>Avoid any buffer dilution effects. The buffer in tube 1 and the buffer in tubes 2-16 must be the same. Otherwise, you will create a gradient in the concentrations of salt, DMSO, glycerol or other additives. This will bias the MST measurements.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200330/20200330122144_5611.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

You can also change the excitation wavelength and/or MST power.
