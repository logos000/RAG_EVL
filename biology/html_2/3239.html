            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Current mass spectrometry (MS) methods and new instrumentation now allow for more accurate identification of proteins in low abundance than previous protein fractionation and identification methods. It was of interest if this method could serve to define the virus proteome of a membrane-containing virus. To evaluate the efficacy of mass spec to determine the proteome of medically important viruses, Sindbis virus (SINV), the prototypical alphavirus was chosen for evaluation. This model system was chosen specifically because the alphaviruses contain members which are human pathogens, this virus is well defined biochemically and structurally, and grows to high titers in both vertebrate and non-vertebrate host cells. The SINV proteome was investigated using this method to determine if host proteins are specifically packaged into infectious virions. It was also of interest if the SINV proteome, when grown in multiple host cells representing vertebrate and mosquito hosts, incorporated specific host proteins from all hosts. Observation of recurrent or distinctive proteins in the virus proteome aided in the determination of proteins incorporated into the virion as opposed to those bound to the particle exterior. Mass spectrometry analysis identified the total protein content of purified virions within limits of detection. The most significant finding was that in addition to the host proteins, SINV non-structural protein 2 (nsP2) was detected within virions grown in all host cells examined. This analysis identified host factors not previously associated with alphavirus entry, replication, or egress, identifying at least one host factor integrally involved in alphavirus replication. Key to the success of this analysis is the method of virus purification which must deliver measurably infectious virus free of high levels of contaminants. For SINV and other members of the alphavirus family, this is accomplished by isopycnic centrifugation through potassium tartrate, followed by a high salt wash.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The terms proteome and proteomics were coined by Marc Wilkins to describe the systematic evaluation of proteins in a model system using a detailed study of structure, function and regulation of its biology including aberrations which lead to disease (Wilkins <em>et al.</em>, 1996 and 2009). However, virus proteomes have been under investigation long before the field of proteomics evolved in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of virus-host interactions <em>in vitro</em> and to evaluate virus pathogenesis of the animal host. To this end it was of interest to evaluate the virus proteome of a model system in a family of viruses which contained medically significant pathogens. Sindbis virus was chosen for this investigation because it is a member of the Alphavirus genus, Family Togaviridae, which contains a significant number of human pathogens of medical importance, it is structurally stable, grows to high titers, is well described in the literature and can be grown in vertebrate and non-vertebrate host cells. Sindbis virus has been the subject of many studies because it is a relatively simple membrane-containing +RNA icosahedral virus (Figure 1). The viral 42S genome is infectious and serves as the template for a 26S subgenomic RNA which encodes the structural genes, organized in the sequence C-PE2(E3/E2)-6K(TF)-E1 3âUTR-polyA (Figure 2). The genomic strand encodes the non-structural proteins in the order 5âUTR-nsP1-nsP2-nsP3-nsP4 (Strauss, J. H. and Strauss, E. G., 1994). The process of virus assembly has marked differences when occurring in vertebrate or invertebrate cells (Brown, 1986). In vertebrate cells the nucleocapsid is pre-assembled in the cytoplasm with the genomic RNA prior to association with the viral protein modified plasma membrane and virus budding from the plasma membrane. In invertebrate cells the virus nucleocapsid and fully matured virus are assembled in endosomes termed âvirus factoriesâ prior to fusion of the virus-containing endosomes with the plasma membrane, releasing infectious particles. Depending on the virusâ host cells origin, the glycosylation patterns of the glycoproteins will be that specified by the cellular biochemistry and the specific lipid bilayer will be that of the host cell. The virus particles released from either host can be equally infectious and if the SVHR strain of Sindbis virus is used close to 100% viability is achieved (Vancini <em>et al.</em>, 2013). This is an important detail because virus infectivity requires all of its components to be in their metastable conformation and native physical state to be functional that is, infectious (Hernandez <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Thus, not all virus particles will be amenable to this method of analysis because the particle structure must be 1) of regular stoichiometry 2) capable of rigorous purification without the loss of infectivity and 3) express a very low particle to PFU ratio. These factors are important to be able to discern any protein contaminants from proteins that are carried within the virus particle. Because of the symmetry of the virus particle and the stoichiometry, the protein concentration can be used to calculate the number of physical particles from the number of infectious particles using the plaque assay to determine infectious particle titer. This specific analysis cannot be applied to non-symmetrical viruses.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190515/20190515182747_1921.jpg" width="170"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

This strain was isolated by Burge and Pfefferkorn in 1966 by collecting virus that was resistant to heating to 54 Â°C. The choice of virus strain is important because this strain produces high titers (10<sup>10</sup> PFU/ml) and low particle/PFU (~1 particle/PFU), ratios of highly infectious and physically stable virus. BHK and C7-10 (<em>Aedes albopictus</em>) cells were obtained from internal collections and are the favored cells to grow SVHR. Virus was harvested from 10 T-75 flasks (Corning) which produces enough virus to form a large visible band in a 30 ml potassium tartrate gradient and sufficient material for the mass spec analysis. Cells were infected at an MOI of 10 PFU/ml, for Sindbis virus infections and allowed to replicate for a single cycle and harvested at 18 h post infection to ensure that no cell lysis took place. A single cycle of SINV growth from mammalian cells is ~12 h and from C7-10 cells is about 24 h. The supernatants were clarified by low speed centrifugation (Sorvall RC-5B Super speed centrifuge at 2,000 rpm, 700 <em>x g</em>). Twenty microliter of the resulting virus supernatant was loaded onto a 15-35% linear potassium tartrate gradient and twice purified by isopycnic ultracentrifugation (Beckman SW-28 rotor, 18 h at 10,000 <em>x g</em>). The resulting band of purified virus was collected and washed twice by pelleting the virus in 5 ml 1x PBS in an SW-40 Beckman-40 rotor at 45,000 rpm (12,000 <em>x g</em>) for 30 min and collecting the pellet.<br/><br/><strong><em>Virus titration by Plaque assay</em></strong><br/>The assay of virus titer by plaque formation, âplaque assayâ is the most accurate method for measuring of the amount of infectious virus. This assay is used to determine the titer, in plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml, of virus by infecting a standardized monolayer of cells with a known volume of a known dilution of a virus-containing solution. The infection is contained under agarose which only allows diffusion of the virus to adjacent cells. Virus from a single initially infected cell infects adjacent cells producing a âplaqueâ or clearing (formed by lysed cells) localized to the original site of infection by an overlay of 1% agarose in 1x EMEM. Plaques of SVHR are visible to the naked eye after neutral red staining within 2-3 days of incubation at 37 Â°C. Begin with an estimate of what the titer could be, if the titer is estimated to be around 10<sup>8</sup> PFU/ml, a flask infected with a dilution of 10<sup>-6</sup> would show 20-200 plaques; in this case, infecting flasks with dilutions of 10<sup>-5</sup>, 10<sup>-6</sup>, and 10<sup>-7</sup> PFU/ml should give adequate data to make a relatively accurate calculation. If the titer of the virus is completely unknown, it may be necessary to infect flasks or plates with a wide range of dilutions (10<sup>-1</sup> to 10<sup>-8</sup>). The number and quality of the plaques seen in a given assay can be influenced by a number of factors, including the pH and/or temperature of media, dilution buffer, agarose overlay, or the condition of the cell monolayer. Due to the sensitivity of this assay, it is important to include both positive and negative controls within each assay. The negative control is a flask that is inoculated with diluent only, and the positive control consists of one dilution of SVHR stock virus of known titer sufficient to give ~20 plaques. This number of plaques is significant statistically.<br/><br/>It is important that when going from a high concentration to a low concentration the pipet tip is changed to avoid âcarry overâ contamination. However, when pipetting from a low concentration to a higher concentration, as is done when the wells are inoculated, a single pipet tip can be used.</p>

This practice avoids the production of defective interfering particles which will accumulate upon successive serial passage of high concentrations of virus. Generally, an MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 0.01 PFU (plaque forming units) per cell is required for production of stock virus. To calculate the correct MOI, the number of cells to be infected must be known. Then multiply the number of cells by the required MOI, <em>e.g.</em>, 10<sup>6</sup> total cells to be infected x MOI of 0.01 = 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of virus inoculum is needed. <br/>If your stock virus is 1 x 10<sup>9</sup> PFU/ml and you need a 10<sup>4</sup> PFU inoculum, do the following:<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Make a serial dilution of the stock virus, begin by making a 1:10 dilution of the stock virus to a total of 1 ml. This will be 100 Âµl of virus supernatant in 900 Âµl of PBS-D + 3% FBS. This is a 10<sup>-1</sup> virus dilution. </li><li>Make a serial dilution of this sample so that you get -1 through -4 dilutions in 5 separate tubes (see Figure 3). The amount of virus that you need is in the -4 dilution tube, 1 ml of virus of 10<sup>-4</sup> PFU/ml. <br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190515/20190515203154_9443.jpg" width="192"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.

Virus particles do not go into true solution and care must be taken to suspend them correctly, otherwise the counts will be artificially high or low. Alternatively, you can use 100 Âµl of the -5 dilution up to a volume of 1 ml or use the entire -5 dilution to make 10 ml of the virus and arrive at the correct MOI.</li><li>Refreeze your initial stock virus; this is your primary stock from which you will grow subsequent stocks. Virus is quantitated by plaque assay on the cells from which the virus produces CPE which is usually the cell line from which it is produced (in this case BHK). However Sindbis virus does not produce CPE in many insect cells (<em>e.g.</em>, U4.4 of C7-10 cells), which cannot be used for the plaque assay. <br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>Stock virus can be grown from vertebrate or invertebrate cells.</em> </li><li><em>Sindbis virus is very sticky and will bind to glass and plastic surfaces. We have found that Corning</em><sup><em>TM</em></sup><em> polypropylene tubes (microcentrifuge tubes, self-standing and conical) bind fewer virus particles than other brands of plastic. Disposable glass tubes are used to make the virus dilutions required for the plaque assay. </em> </li><li><em>Tissue culture grade reagents from all major suppliers have been found suitable for the cell culture and virus production portions of this protocol.<br/></em><br/></li></ol></li></ol><strong><em>Virus titration by plaque formation on BHK cells</em></strong><br/><u>Preparation of BHK cells</u><br/><em>Note: Individual stocks of BHK cells, </em><em>e.g.</em><em>, from ATCC, may require different passage schedules and may have different numbers of viable passages.</em> <ol class="npwtwo"><li>Wash a confluent BHK cell monolayer once with 1x PBS-D, using 5 ml for a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask or 15 ml for a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.</li><li>Decant PBS-D and add trypsin to the monolayer. Add 2 ml to a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks, or 5 ml to a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask. Incubate at room temperature until the cells begin to detach from the flask. Disrupt cell clumps by pipetting up and down using a 5 to 10 ml serological pipet. </li><li>Add BHK medium 1:1 to stop trypsin. Resuspend cells in the trypsin solution and check for cell clumps by under the microscope. If there are significant remaining clumps, pipet up and down using a 5 to 10 ml serological pipet. </li><li>Pipet cell solution into a conical tube of the appropriate size, <em>e.g.</em>, 10 or 50 ml tubes.</li><li>Spin tube(s) at 500 <em>x g</em> (medium speed on a tabletop centrifuge) for 3 to 5 min to form a firm pellet. Do not overfill tube. Do not invert tube to mix.</li><li>Decant supernatant and replace with the appropriate amount of medium 3 ml for 25-cm<sup>2</sup> flask and 9 ml for a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.<ol class="npwthree"><li>For preparation of a single 25-cm<sup>2</sup> flask: Resuspend in 3 ml E-MEM. Add 1 ml of cells to 10 ml of medium in the flask. Up to 3 flasks can be prepared from one initial 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask, at a 1:3 split ratio (area of the flask). Cap flasks tightly (vented caps, leave loose for non-vented caps).</li><li>9-25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks can be prepared from 1-75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.<br/><br/></li></ol></li></ol><u>The materials for plaque assay</u><br/>Many of the materials used for the plaque assays are used for both mammalian and mosquito cell assays. It is important to make the serial dilutions of virus immediately prior to infection of the plaque assay flasks/plates to limit the amount of virus binding to the tubes.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Determine the number of plates/flasks required, with two wells per dilution of virus (plated in duplicate), plus a few control plates or wells. The day before the plaque assay, split BHK cells into 6-well plates containing ~6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cell/plate = 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well. In general, the use of 6-well plates has replaced the use of individual flasks; however when learning the technique the use of flasks in much simpler.<br/><em>Note: The number of cells required is determined by the confluency required at the time of the assay. Because confluency is related to the area the cells cover, this number is manipulated by knowing the area of the vessel the cells will grow on. Thus, the area of the flasks (rectangular) or wells (circular) will vary but the number of cells/cm</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><em> is constant. (</em><em>e.g.</em><em>, 1 x 10</em><sup><em>6</em></sup><em> cells. For a 6- well plate, each well is 9.6 cm</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><em> seeded with 1 x 10</em><sup><em>6</em></sup><em> cells/well x 6 wells for a total of ~58 cm</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><em> onto which a total of ~6 x 10</em><sup><em>6</em></sup><em> cells is seeded. These numbers are relative to every specific culture of any cell line and may need to be adjusted up or down. The important thing is the % confluency on the day of the assay during which the cells should still be in log phase. </em> </li><li>Allow cell monolayers to become ~80%-90% confluent by the time of the plaque assay. <br/><em>Note: If the cells are ready in the morning and the assay is to be done in the afternoon, the cells can be stored at room temperature with the caps closed tightly, or moved to a 28 Â°C incubator to slow growth.</em> </li><li>Remove the virus to be titered from the freezer and thaw on ice. </li><li>Fill the required number of dilution tubes with 900 Î¼l diluent (SVHR diluent; 1x PBS-D/3% FBS (see Recipes). You need one tube/dilution. One tube for the control (not infected) and one for the positive infected control.</li><li>Prepare serial dilutions of the virus by adding 100 Î¼l virus to the first tube containing 900 Âµl of diluent (10<sup>-1</sup>), vortex that dilution at full speed, removing 100 Î¼l, and adding it to the next dilution tube (10<sup>-2</sup>). Continue this process until the desired dilutions have been made. Change pipet tips each time to avoid âcarry-overâ effect of contaminating virus.<br/><em>Note: Dilutions should be made immediately prior to use. Virus and dilutions should be kept on ice at all times. </em> </li><li>Once the dilutions have been made, pour growth media out of flasks (into a sterile waste beaker) and pipet out of plates with a serological pipet (leave enough liquid to cover the monolayer) and infect each flask or well of a 6-well plate with 200 Î¼l of the appropriate dilution. In this case, the area of the vessel no longer matters because the calculation will convert plaques at each dilution to PFU/ml.</li><li>Do not let monolayers dry out while adding virusâ<em>i.e.</em>, do not pour/pipette media off too many flasks/plates at one time or try to drain every drop. DRY MONOLAYERS ARE DEAD MONOLAYERS.</li><li>Place <u>flasks</u> on a rocking platform at room temperature for one hour. Do not rock plates; the liquid will only swirl around the edge of the well. Place the plates at the appropriate temperature, 38 Â°C for BHK cells and hand rock every 15 min. <br/><em>Note: The caps on the flasks should be tightened while they are rocking since they are not in the appropriate CO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em> environment unless they are vented, then place these in the incubator.</em> </li><li>After an hour of rocking/incubating, remove the inoculum (pipette) and overlay the monolayer with 7 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 2% agarose in dH<sub>2</sub>O and complete 2x EMEM with 7 ml for T-25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks and 2 ml for each well of a 6-well plate. <br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>The agarose should be hot enough that it will not solidify too quickly, but cool enough to allow one to touch the bottle before mixing with the medium (~60-70 Â°C). Bottles of media at the correct temperature should not feel excessively hot to the touch. Do not try to move flasks/plates before the overlay has solidified, because the cell monolayer will tear. Solidified agar will appear cloudy. </em> </li><li><em>Not all agarose is tolerated by cells in culture. In general, agarose formulated for gel electrophoresis or chromatography is not suitable for tissue culture. Use Sigma agarose () (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, catalog number: A6013).</em> </li></ol></li><li>Incubate flasks for 2 days at 37 Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. <br/><em>Note: Before staining monolayers, hold the flasks up to the light to see if plaques are visible. The plaques will appear more opaque than the rest of the monolayer. Visible plaques are an indication that the assay has worked up to this step. </em> </li><li>To stain the monolayer, add 5 ml of 1:1 mixture of 2% agarose in dH<sub>2</sub>O and 2x PBS-D with 3% neutral red stain (3% of the total amount of agarose required). Cover the flasks to protect cells from light. <br/><em>Note: Cells become light sensitive after they take up neutral red and should be protected from light.</em> </li><li>If necessary, when the plaques are faint, return flasks (plates) to 37 Â°C for 4 h or 28 Â°C overnight prior to counting plaques.<br/><em>Note: You should expect to see clear plaques surrounded by red, living cells. The number of plaques per flask should roughly follow the dilutions made (</em><em>e.g.</em><em>, 1 plaque on 10</em><sup><em>-6</em></sup><em> flask, 10 plaques on 10</em><sup><em>-5</em></sup><em> flask, and 100 plaques on 10</em><sup><em>-4</em></sup><em> flask). Plates can be used to produce duplicates (6-well plates) or triplicates (24-well plates). If there are no plaques, check the monolayers under the microscope, the cells may be lysed.</em> </li><li>Count plaques and calculate the titer.</li><li>To calculate the virus titer: <em>e.g.</em>, with 2 plaques at -7 dilution and an inoculum of 200 Âµl, convert this to plaques/ml or 2 plaques x 1/200 Âµl x 10<sup>3</sup> Âµl/1 ml = 10 plaques/ml from a 1/10<sup>-7</sup> dilution = 10 x 10<sup>7</sup> or 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> PFU/ml. Thus the equation is #plaques/dilution factor (ml) x volume of inoculum (ml) = PFU/ml. Unless the number of virus particles = number of plaques/ml then this unit is a plaque forming unit. This will be explained in the section calculating the particle to PFU ratio.<br/><em>Note: If there are no plaques but the positive control worked then the sample has no virus or the incorrect dilutions were plated. If there are no plaques in the control sample check the cells under the microscope for lysis, lysed cells will not take up stain or produce a plaque. Cell lysis will occur if the osmolarity and tonicity of the cultures are not correct. Crystals of stain mean that the agarose was too hot when it was added. Agarose that is too hot will also kill the cells.<br/></em><br/></li></ol></li><li>Sindbis virus infection of vertebrate and invertebrate cells<br/><strong><em>Sindbis virus infection of BHK cells</em></strong> <ol class="npwtwo"><li>Subculture BHK cells the day prior to infection such that the monolayer is ~90% confluent at the time of infection. </li><li>Calculate the amount of virus needed for the desired multiplicity of infection (MOI).<br/>No. cells x MOI = PFU needed. <br/>For a single cycle MOI = 10, stock virus MOI = 0.01<br/>For 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask, the number of cells is ~ 2 x 10<sup>7</sup>cells<br/>For 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask, the number of cells is ~6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells <br/>For a 6-well plate, the number of cells is about 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/plate. <br/>Plates are also used if a small amount of inoculum is used, <em>e.g.</em>, stock virus volume titer is too low to infect too many cells and the virus must be amplified before use.</li><li>Remove the virus from -80 Â°C freezer and thaw the vial on ice. Dilute inoculum to the desired concentration in 1x PBS-D/3% FBS. Refreeze unused stock virus.<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>A total volume of at least 1 ml is required for infection of 75 cm</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><em> monolayer, and a minimum of 200 Î¼l is required for a 25 cm</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><em> monolayer. A minimum of 200 Î¼l is required for a 6-well plate. Close the cap tightly and secure to rocker platform. Do not rock plates.</em> </li><li><em>SVHR is heat stable however, many other strains and mutants of Sindbis are not, and thus must be thawed on ice to retain infectivity.</em> </li></ol></li><li>Place flask on a rocking platform for 1 h at room temperature, with caps tightened. Alternatively, infect in the incubator at 37 Â°C with intermittent hand rocking. </li><li>Remove inoculum and add fresh, complete 1x E-MEM media. Add 5-7 ml media to a 75-cm<sup>2</sup> monolayer or 3 ml to a 25-cm<sup>2</sup> monolayer. Leave the caps loosened during incubation to allow for CO<sub>2</sub> exchange. If more concentrated virus is desired, add 3 ml medium to a 75-cm<sup>2</sup> monolayer. Do not allow the monolayer to dry out.</li><li>Virus should be harvested once CPE becomes evident, which is generally between 18 (BHK) and 24 h (C7-10) post-infection. <br/><em>Note: Cell lines will differ in the time period in which CPE is demonstrated. Some indicators of CPE in BHK cells include the cells becoming long and thin, cytoplasm with a âfoamyâ appearance, aggregations of cell nuclei, and, in advanced stages, cell lysis. Do not allow the cells to lyse for any type of virus analysis work.</em> </li><li>Remove medium from flasks to conical centrifuge tubes (Corning, 15 ml Fisherbrand Cat # 05-539-5 or 50 ml centrifuge tubes, Fisherbrand Cat # 05-539-6). Combine like samples if desired. Spin samples for 10 min in a tabletop centrifuge at ~700 <em>x g</em> to remove cell debris. Decant virus to a new tube and bring the solution to 10% glycerol which acts as a cryoprotectant. Aliquot the virus supernatant into tubes appropriate for freezing and flash freeze virus using liquid N<sub>2</sub>. </li><li>Store virus at -80 Â°C. <br/><em>Note: Membrane containing viruses will undergo a freeze-thaw at -65 Â°C due to phase transition in ice. Thus a freezer failure resulting in warming to -65 Â°C should be considered a thaw. Sindbis virus will lose some titer (~ 0.5 logs) upon freeze-thaw but is still infectious.</em> </li></ol><br/><strong><em>Sindbis virus infection of C7-10 cells</em></strong><br/>Mosquito cells are used when a comparative analysis of virus titers from the invertebrate host are required. To infect mosquito cells, a confluent monolayer of single cells (no clumps) must be formed. Mosquito cells do not adhere well to the substrate, and tend to lift from the flasks regardless of the medium used. To temporarily circumvent this problem, mosquito cultures can be starved for serum for one hour, which causes the cells to adhere to the substrate more tightly. Mosquito cultures in our lab have been adapted to use in E-MEM, however, all other treatments of the cells are consistent with cells which are in other insect media.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Spin down for 5 min at 200-500 <em>x g</em> approximately 1Â½ -75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks of cells per 1-75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask needed for infection. <br/><em>Note: Mosquito cells grow as semi-suspension cultures and are easily removed from the flask by tapping the flask against a hard surface, or alternatively by pipetting up and down with a 5-10 ml pipet. Do not spin excessively as the cells will die during pelleting or resuspension. Some cells will be lost during the process.</em> </li><li>Wash the cell pellet once with 1x PBS-D to remove any remaining medium. </li><li>Resuspend the final cell pellet in 1 ml/flask needed for infection, of E-MEM medium deficient in FBS.</li><li>Count the cells using a hemocytometer. </li><li>Aliquot approximately 6 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells per 75-cm<sup>2</sup> flask with enough medium (without FBS) to cover the monolayer. </li><li>Incubate the flask of cells at 28 Â°C for one hour, or until cells are well attached to the surface of the flask. </li><li>Once cells are attached, remove medium and add the desired amount of virus to the monolayer. Close caps tightly. </li><li>Rock the flask slowly at room temperature for one hour. <br/><em>Note: Rocking slowly is critical to keep a minimum number of cells from lifting from the flask.</em> </li><li>Most of the cells should remain attached to the flask after rocking. If cells have lifted from the monolayer they should be removed with the inoculum. </li><li>Fresh, complete E-MEM medium should be added to each flask. <br/><em>Note: To increase the concentration of virus, minimize the volume of fresh medium added to the flasks. A minimum of 3 ml medium/75 cm</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><em> is required to cover the cells and support metabolism. Take care that the flasks are level to ensure complete coverage of the monolayers.</em> </li><li>Virus may be harvested from 24 to 72 hpi depending on the multiplicity (MOI) used. Cytopathic effect (CPE) will not be evident in mosquito cells, in which case virus will be harvested based on time post-infection rather than CPE. </li><li>For normal storage: Harvest virus and store in sterile 10% glycerol. For best preservation of the virus titer quick freeze tubes in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. <br/><em>Note: Virus frozen and thawed will lose 1/3 to 1/5 log of titer. This is not a significant loss for use to infect cells. For preservation of the highest infectivity level, virus can be stored at 4 Â°C for up to 5 days in neutral pH buffer. This method preserves the most infectivity and is used for virus to be analyzed in structural studies and for the calculation of particle to PFU ratios.<br/></em><br/></li></ol></li><li>Purification of Sindbis virus<br/><strong><em>Purification and concentration by isopycnic centrifugation</em></strong><br/>The virus supernatant is harvested into conical tubes and cell debris is removed from the supernatant by low-speed centrifugation. This is a critical step and if it is omitted, too much debris will interfere with the following gradient purification steps. Clarify virus supernatant by centrifugation in the appropriate size conical tube for 10 min at 1,800 <em>x g</em>.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Virus supernatant is combined into an appropriate size container omitting addition of the glycerol. <br/><em>Note: From this step forward, you should not consider your samples sterile. This is not usually a problem and antibiotic is added to the 2x E-MEM media.</em> </li><li>Determine the number of gradients which will be needed. <br/>Typically, 20 ml of virus is layered onto the initial potassium tartrate step gradient in the 38 ml tubes. This gradient is formed by carefully layering 12 ml of 15% potassium tartrate onto a layer of 6 ml of 35% potassium tartrate, or making a 10% to 35% continuous potassium tartrate gradient. Read the manufacturerâs manual for instructions on use of the gradient former. The tubes are placed into the rotor buckets and weighed upright (we use a small beaker cushioned with tissue). PBS-D is added drop- wise to balance the tubes. <u>Take special care to weigh the buckets and tubes, and load the centrifuge rotor according to the manufacturerâs tolerances and specifications found in the manual. Failure to do so can result in severe damage to the rotor and the instrument.</u> <br/><em>Note: The rotor, buckets and solutions should be pre-chilled to 4 Â°C. If an odd number of gradients are required a âblankâ gradient is made and overlaid with buffer to balance the rotor.</em> </li><li>The gradients are centrifuged overnight (this is purely for convenience) at 24,000 rpm in an SW-28 Beckman rotor (or 100,000 <em>x g</em>) and 4 Â°C. </li><li>After the run is completed, remove a tube carefully from the bucket and attach to a ring stand using a small tube clamp. A virus band of iridescent blue should be visible at the potassium tartrate 15%-35% step interface when the gradient is illuminated from the side with a hand held light of 20 watts. See Figure 4 Density gradient purified Sindbis virus band. Repeat for each of the gradients. </li><li>Collect the band by puncturing the bottom of the tube and letting the tartrate solution flow into a waste beaker, while collecting the virus band into a 2 ml cryotube. Discard the remaining solution. Alternatively, the band can be collected from the side of the tube using a needle and syringe.</li><li>Pool the virus-containing samples and dilute with 1.5 volumes of ice-cold PBS-D. This solution should be less dense than 15% potassium tartrate. To check that your concentration is correct, your virus solution should not sink into an aliquot of 15% potassium tartrate. </li><li>This diluted virus is then layered over a continuous 15%-35% potassium tartrate linear gradient of a volume not less than Â¾ of the added virus sample. The first gradient may be a step or linear gradient but the second should be a linear one. Do not overfill. </li><li>The continuous gradients are run for 2 h at 26,000 rpm in an SW 40ti Beckman rotor (120,000 <em>x g</em>) and the virus band collected as described in Step D6 above. The virus band should appear about 1/3 down the length of the tube. The virus band may be stored at 4 Â°C in the tartrate solution. The refractive index of the final virus-tartrate solution is 1.3665 which is ~28% tartrate (Rumble, 2005). </li><li>Collect a sample of the virus to titrate by plaque assay and to determine protein concentration by BCA assay (Pierce<sup>TM</sup> Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher). <br/><em>Note: Properly grown and purified SVHR should give a particle/PFU value of ~1.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="131" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190515/20190515203304_5212.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.

A virgin or unused column is important to ensure that all peptides identified are from the sample and not from a previous LC-MS/MS run which could result from âcarry overâ if using a column that already had a sample applied. The liquid chromatography gradient should be chosen to allow for adequate separation without excessive time. These parameters depend upon the column and instrument used for analysis. For the gradient, the A buffer is 3% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid and the B buffer is 95% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid. Tryptic peptides should be analyzed in at least technical triplicates.</li><li>For the Orbitrap ELITE the following configurations were used.
