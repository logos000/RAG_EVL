            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Determining the neuronal circuitry responsible for specific behaviors is a major focus in the field of neurobiology. Activity-dependent immediate early genes (IEGs), transcribed and translated shortly after neurons discharge action potentials, have been used extensively to either identify or gain genetic access to neurons and brain regions involved in such behaviors. By using immunohistochemistry for the protein product of the IEG c-Fos combined with retrograde labeling of specific neuronal populations, precise experimental timing, and identical data acquisition and processing, we present a method to quantitatively identify specific neuronal subpopulations that were active during social encounters. We have previously used this method to show a stronger recruitment of ventral hippocampal neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex, compared to those that project to the lateral hypothalamus, following social interactions. After optimization of surgeries for the injection of retrograde tracers, this method will be useful for the identification and mapping of neuronal populations engaged in many different behaviors.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>A cornerstone goal of the neurobiology field is to determine how the brain processes sensory inputs and produces commands for behavioral outputs. In the past two decades, certain brain regions have become canonical examples in their control of specific behaviors, such as the hippocampus for location memory (Bird and Burgess, 2008). Recent work is beginning to parse out what these regions specifically do in a way that can be generalized to multiple behaviors (Aronov <em>et al.</em>, 2017), and to determine the roles of multiple brain regions in a given behavior connected by long-range neuronal projections (Kohl <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The first pass in determining which neuronal projections are involved in a particular behavior is to be able to measure the relative activity of neurons sending these projections during the behavior itself, with the concept that the most important neuronal projections will be selectively activated compared to neighboring neurons projecting to different brain regions.<br/> <br/>The IEG c-Fos encodes for a transcriptional regulator that has become popular for the identification and mapping of recently active neurons due to its rapid transcription and translation following Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx caused by the discharge of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent action potentials. In neurons, one of the most influential molecular pathways leading to transcription and translation of c-Fos is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is activated by transient increases of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration brought up by activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels following depolarization by glutamate activation of AMPA-type receptors, as well as by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptors (Herrera and Robertson, 1996; Hudson, 2018). It is, however, important to note that increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration also lead to c-Fos expression in non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes and microglia (Eun <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Groves <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Accumulation of c-Fos protein begins approximately 45 min after action potential discharge, reaching peak levels after 1-2 h (Barros <em>et al.</em>, 2015). While organic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive dyes and genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (such as GCaMP) provide a more precise temporal estimation of neural activity in the millisecond-to-second timescale, dyes and sensors require invasive surgical procedures, and current attempts to co-register activity to specific cell subtypes is cumbersome and time-consuming.<br/> <br/>Several genetic c-Fos-based strategies have been developed to tag active neurons during specific temporal windows using the rapid transcription and translation of IEGs, including the Fos-tTa and FosTRAP approaches. Fos-tTa uses the c-Fos promoter to drive the expression of the doxycycline-repressible tetracycline transactivator. In the absence of doxycycline (Dox), a reporter tags the cells with LacZ, which can then be visualized and quantified. However, the slow metabolism of Dox results in a long labeling window in the time frame of several days, which leads to low signal-to-noise (DeNardo and Luo, 2017). An improvement on temporal resolution was achieved with FosTRAP, which reduced the labeling window to ~12 h by using the Cre recombinase system, and a benefit of this system is that it allows genetic access to the labeled neurons (DeNardo and Luo, 2017). However, both of these genetic techniques reduce the temporal specificity of c-Fos itself. Due to their low temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, quantification of relative neuronal activity is difficult and unreliable. An alternative to genetic approaches for labeling IEG-determined neuronal subsets is to perform immunohistochemistry for c-Fos protein after sacrificing the animal. This technique is commonly used to identify neurons and classifying them as either c-Fos positive or negative cells based on user-defined thresholds. However, immunohistochemical labeling of c-Fos has the potential to be used in a more quantitative manner by ensuring a precise timing interval between behavioral interactions and animal sacrifice, as well as ensuring identical tissue processing and imaging techniques. Quantification of c-Fos levels provides a more accurate depiction of neuronal activity, revealing relative activity of neurons based on subtype, projection, and/or experience, as well as reducing bias introduced by user-defined arbitrary cutoffs to score a neuron as a c-Fos positive cell.<br/> <br/>Here, we describe a method that utilizes a precise timing between behavioral interactions and immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos that allows for reliable quantification of relative neuronal activity in different neuron subsets defined by their projection target regions. Fluorescent retrograde tracers are intracranially injected into projection targets of our primary brain region of interest. Retrograde tracers are taken up by axon terminals (Riddle <em>et al.</em>, 1995) and transported back to the cell bodies, marking these neurons based on their projection targets. In our study, we injected green fluorescent microbeads (Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup>) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and red Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> in the lateral hypothalamus (lHYP) for the identification of projection neurons in the CA1 region of the ventral hippocampus (vCA1) (Phillips <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This technique can be widely applied to other brain regions or by using alternative techniques to label specific neuronal subtypes. After allowing sufficient time for the retrograde transfer of the Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> and recovery from surgery (approximately 2 weeks), mice are subject to sequential interactions with either two conspecifics (social condition) or two fake toy mice (object condition). Mice are anesthetized and fixed by transcardiac perfusion at precisely 45 min after the conclusion of these interactions, and c-Fos levels, revealed by immunohistochemistry on sections from the ventral hippocampus, are used as a surrogate for neuronal activity during the interactions. By using a precise timing, we ensure the highest possible resolution and selectivity for neuronal activity driven by behavioral interactions. By comparing c-Fos levels within neurons with different projection targets, and between neurons from mice in either the social or object conditions, we determine the specificity of neuronal activity by projection region, as well as the selectivity for social encounters (Phillips <em>et al.</em>, 2019). While this protocol has previously been used to gauge neuronal activation following social versus object interaction, the test mouse can be exposed to different stimuli during the behavioral paradigm to assess neural activation to other social cues such as male/female odor or social novelty.</p>

Timeline of experimental procedures.</strong> Mice are injected with Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> one week prior to behavioral acclimation. On days 1-3, mice are acclimated to the testing room. On days 4-6, mice are handled (to reduce their anxiety) and the test mice are acclimated to the testing chamber. On day 7, mice are exposed to the behavioral paradigm for labeling and sacrificed.</p><br/><ol class="npwone"><li>Surgery<br/><em>Notes:</em><br/><ol class="npwthree"><li><em>For the behavioral paradigm, you will need one non-surgical mouse per cage acting as a known sentinel. In group housed males, it is recommended that the groups including the sentinel are littermates and that the housing is kept to no more than 5 mice per cage.

This is easily done by adding an additional site in the dorsoventral axis, determined by choosing sites equidistance from region boundaries per a standard mouse brain atlas.</em> </li><li><em>Retrobeads</em><sup><em>TM</em></sup><em> can easily clog the injection needle. Be sure not to let the Retrobeads</em><sup><em>TM</em></sup><em> sit in the needle for any longer than strictly necessary. To reduce this time, only draw up enough Retrobeads</em><sup><em>TM</em></sup><em> per dorso-ventral axis and give test pulses regularly (where a small amount ~1 nl is dispensed). Between dorso-ventral axes, wipe the tip of the needle with alcohol wipes. Ensure the needle is not clogged before and after insertion into the brain by giving a test pulse and observing the ejection of Retrobeads</em><sup><em>TM</em></sup><em>. If Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> are not ejected, the needle is clogged and will not (and may not have) deliver the necessary amount of Retrobeads</em><sup><em>TM</em></sup><em>.

Be sure to check a few brain sections from each condition to ensure these settings are suitable for the entire dataset. No pixels in any image should be brighter than the maximum in any of the experimental conditions (<em>i.e.</em>, avoid image saturation).</li><li>Recommended settings include:<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Pinhole set to 1 Airy unit, as determined by the image acquisition software of the confocal microscope.</li><li>Lower gain can be compensated by slightly increasing laser power.</li><li>Use only minimal PMT offset.</li><li>Use consecutive excitation of all channels through line scan (<em>i.e.</em>, do not use simultaneous excitation to avoid spectral âbleed-throughâ and shifting).</li><li>Use line averaging (2 should be sufficient).</li><li>Use 1,024 x 1,024 pixel image size, saved at 16 bit pixel depth resolution.</li><li>Z-axis interval set to optimal as determined by confocal software.</li></ol></li><li>Depending on the number of neurons labeled per section, determine how many images you will take per section for the desired sample number (ânâ). In Phillips <em>et al.</em> (2019), the entire region from each section was imaged, and every Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup>-labeled neuron analyzed. This may not be feasible in other brain regions, depending on density of labeled neurons.</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti35550">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz"><em>Note: See Figure 3 for the workflow of data analysis.</em> </p><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Open images in ImageJ (or FIJI) (Figure 4A).</li><li>Subtract the background from all channels, setting to 30 pixels (Figure 4B).</li><li>Despeckle the c-Fos (blue) channels (Figure 4C).</li><li>Merge the Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> and NeuN channels (Figure 4D).</li><li>Set Measurement settings to record the mean gray value and redirect to c-Fos channel (Figure 4E).</li><li>If using two Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> colors for different projection neurons, turn off one of Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> channels using the Channels tool. Adjust brightness and contrast in order to identify individual neurons that contain Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup>.</li><li>For each Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> and NeuN positive neuron, zoom in and scroll through the z-planes until you find the plane in which the neuron is most in focus (usually the largest soma size). Trace the neuronâs profile using the Freehand selection tool (Figure 4F).</li><li>Change the z-plane on the c-Fos channel window to match the Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup>/NeuN window. Measure the gray value (Figure 4F).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="109" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200903/20200903030938_6621.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 4. Image analysis workflow.</strong> Begin by opening images, check the split channels box so that options box matches that pictured (A). Subtract background with a 30 pixel rolling ball radius on all channels (B). Despeckle the c-Fos channel (C). Merge the Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> and NeuN channels (D). Set measurement settings to record the mean gray value, redirect to the c-Fos channel (E). Manually circle the NeuN label that contains Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup> (F). Being sure to move the c-Fos channel to the same z-plane, measure the intensity (G).<br/><br/></li><li>Repeat steps 7 and 8 for all Retrobeads<sup>TM</sup>-labeled neurons.</li><li>Measure the c-Fos intensity of several neuron-sized regions of background and record for each section.</li><li>When intensity collection is finalized, load the averaged background intensity per section into a statistical program (<em>i.e.</em>, Prism) to determine outliers using Grubbâs test set at 1%. Remove neurons from sections whose background was determined to be an outlier.</li><li>Data can be displayed either by using each neuron as an individual ânâ, or, by averaging neurons from each animal. Phillips <em>et al.</em> (2019) chose to display data in both ways, with statistical testing being performed on the later.</li><li>Be sure to use appropriate testing for the number of conditions in the experiment (<em>e.g.</em>, 3- or 2-way ANOVA).
