            <h1>Analysis of Random Migration of Cancer Cells in 3D</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Sai P. Visweshwaran, Alexis Gautreau</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The ability of cancer cells to migrate through a complex three-dimensional (3D) environment is a hallmark event of cancer metastasis. Therefore, an <em>in vitro</em> migration assay to evaluate cancer cell migration in a 3D setting is valuable to examine cancer progression. Here, we describe such a simple migration assay in a 3D collagen-fibronectin gel for observing cell morphology and comparing the migration abilities of cancer cells. We describe below how to prepare the collagen-fibronectin gel castings, how to set up time-lapse recording, how to draw single-cell trajectories from movies and extract key parameters that characterize cell motility, such as cell speed, directionality, mean square displacement, and directional persistence. In our set-up, cells are sandwiched in a single plane between two collagen-fibronectin gels. This trick facilitates the analysis of cell tracks, which are for the most part 2D, at least in the beginning, but in a 3D environment. This protocol has been previously published in Visweshwaran <em>et al.</em> (2018) and is described here in more detail.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The migration of cells within our body is an essential process and driven by complex underlying cellular functions. It plays an important role in many physiological processes, including development, immune responses, and tissue regeneration (Kunwar <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Friedl and Weigelin, 2008; Reig <em>et al.</em>, 2014). In addition, certain pathological situations such as tumor invasion and metastasis rely on cell motility (Thiery, 2002). Consequently, cell migration has become a major field of study in the context of both fundamental and translational research. Although in the last decade we have witnessed enormous advances in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the highly plastic process of cell migration, many questions remain open. Especially, the complex regulation of migration is still unclear within differently composed microenvironments that are crowded by cells and extracellular matrix (Petrie <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Friedl and Wolf, 2010).<br/><br/>To analyze cell migration, several <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> cell migration assays have been developed over the years. The<em>in vivo</em> cell migration assays most closely mimic the real physiological situation and observe cells within their natural environment with its complexities of variable extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, geometry, topography and pore size. However, performing such experiments is labor- and cost-intensive, time-consuming, tough to control and requires advanced imaging techniques and animal experiments. Due to such practical challenges, cell migration has traditionally been studied on two-dimensional (2D) surfaces (Dang and Gautreau, 2018), <em>e.g.</em>, in the context of wound-healing assays (Molinie and Gautreau, 2018). While this works to some extent for adherent cells such as breast epithelial carcinoma cells, 2D migration assays have little physiological relevance and thus little predictive value. Moreover, the striking difference between the 2D and the 3D settings becomes understandable in the light of recent studies of cell motility (LÃ¤mmermann <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Friedl <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Petrie and Yamada, 2016). These recent studies demonstrate that cell migration is a very plastic process and the cells embedded in 3D matrices composed of collagens or matrigel employ a very different locomotory machinery than cells on 2D surfaces. Therefore, studying the migration of cells embedded within a physiological-like 3D environment could lead to the results that have more significance and better predictive value.<br/><br/>Apart from being easier to perform than true <em>in vivo</em> migration experiments, 3D migration assays with their simpler matrix composition offer the advantage of a controlled, easily manipulable environment. Thus, it facilitates easy dissection of molecular mechanisms and the interpretation of experimental results. The 3D migration studies are usually done with the help of Boyden chambers (<em>e.g.</em>, transwell assays [Visweshwaran <em>et al.</em>, 2018]). However, these assays typically provide only an endpoint readout of cell migration efficiency, thereby not much information derived for an in-depth analysis. In contrast, real-time microscopy-based 3D assays allow one to observe and track individual cells, and thus the analysis of various parameters such as cell morphology during migration, cell speed, and directionality.<br/><br/> To our knowledge, there are not many optimal methods available for 3D cell migration analysis. All existing methods have their limitations. They either allow the experimenter to use a set-up where the embedded cells in the collagen gel are prone to migrate randomly in all directions including Z-axis, which render them hard to track and quantify migration parameters, or compel the experimenter to use complex, hard-to-handle and often costly setups (Rommerswinkel <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Biswenger <em>et al.</em>, 2018) to perform 3D migration assays. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a set-up where cells are sandwiched in a single plane between two collagen-fibronectin gels. This procedure facilitates the analysis of cell tracks, which are for the most part 2D, at least in the beginning, but in a 3D environment. In essence, here we describe an easy method for performing and analyzing 3D migration assays based on a home-made set-up and an easy analysis pipeline.</p>

Briefly, top panels display single-cell trajectories. Mean Square Displacement (MSD) analysis shows that HSBP1 depleted cells explore a smaller territory than control cells. This effect might be accounted for by decreased speed and directional persistence.

For a long-term effect analysis, the drug could be added while making the collagen-fibronectin gels and in the medium that is added at the final stage to prevent the gel drying. In this method, cells are exposed constantly to the drug for a full period of observation. On the other end, the addition of drugs/inhibitors during 3D migration is also possible. In this method, a high concentration of drug should be added (1-10 Âµl) gently to the medium that is present on the top of the gels to prevent the gel drying. Here, the drug will diffuse into the gels. In this case, the experimenter initially would record a 3D cell migration for a period where there is no drug treatment and after addition of the drug, a period of 3D cell migration under drug treatment. If the drugs/inhibitors are toxic, a brief pre-treatment of the cells with the drug and sandwiching them between gels for migration analysis are also an alternative method.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30940">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>MDA-MB-231 culture medium<br/>L-15 medium<br/>10% FBS<br/>1x Penicillin-Streptomycin</li><li>Collagen-Fibronectin gel mix<br/>2 mg/ml Collagen I<br/>10 Âµg/ml FN<br/>25 mM HEPES<br/>10% FBS<br/>1x MEM completed with sterile water<br/><strong>For 1 ml gel volume:</strong><br/><table border="0" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="ke-zeroborder" style="width:300px;"><tbody><tr><td>10x MEM<br/></td><td>100 Âµl<br/></td></tr><tr><td>HEPES (1 M)<br/></td><td>25 Âµl<br/></td></tr><tr><td>Collagen I (4.41 mg/ml)<br/></td><td>452 Âµl<br/></td></tr><tr><td>FBS<br/></td><td>100 Âµl<br/></td></tr><tr><td>FN<br/></td><td>10 Âµl<br/></td></tr><tr><td>Sterile water<br/></td><td>313 Âµl<br/></td></tr></tbody></table></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30941">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This protocol was adapted from Dang <em>et al.</em> (2013) with modifications.
