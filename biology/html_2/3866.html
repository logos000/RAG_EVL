            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Olfactory behavior is among the most fundamental animal behaviors both in the wild and in the laboratory. To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying olfactory behavior, it is critical to measure neural responses to odorant concentration changes resembling those that animals actually sense during olfactory behavior. However, reproducing the dynamically changing olfactory stimuli to an animal during such measurements of neural activity is technically challenging. Here, we describe technical details and protocols for odor stimulation during calcium imaging of the sensory neurons of the nematode <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>. In this system, the neuronal activity of <em>C. elegans</em> is measured using ratiometric calcium imaging during exposure to quantitatively controlled olfactory stimuli over time. Temporal changes in odor concentrations around the animal are precisely controlled according to a predesigned temporal odor gradient to reproduce a realistic odor concentration change during olfactory behavior in a behavioral arena. By monitoring neural activity in response to the realistic olfactory stimulus, it is possible to elucidate the mechanisms by which olfactory input is processed by neural activities and reflected in behavioral output.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>Olfaction is an important modality that almost all animal species use for survival and reproduction, and olfactory behaviors, such as pheromonal responses, innate/learned fear responses, and olfactory navigation, have been intensively studied (Bargmann, 2006; Jacobs, 2012; Isosaka <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Yabuki <em>et al.</em>, 2016). These behaviors are guided by dynamically changing sensory input. For example, approaching or withdrawing from an odor source causes gradual changes in the odor concentration sensed by an animal. Because odor concentration information is usually not delivered smoothly or consistently but rather unequally and/or with certain noise, the nervous systems of animals must process dynamically changing sensory stimuli properly using temporal differentiation and/or integration (Tanimoto and Kimura, 2019).<br/></p><p><br/>To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying olfactory behavior, it is crucial to measure neural responses to gradually changing olfactory stimuli similar to what animals actually sense during the behavior. However, in most conventional studies, step-wise stimuli (<em>i.e.</em>, the sudden presentation and/or withdrawal of an odor stimulus) have been typically used instead of realistic gradual changes in odorant concentration. This is partly because it is technically challenging to stimulate animals with a realistic gradual concentration change because it is difficult to: (1) measure the odor concentration actually sensed by an animal during olfactory behavior; and (2) quantitatively control the odor stimuli presented to awake behaving animals to reproduce the measured realistic gradual concentration changes. Accordingly, conventional studies have increased our understanding of only limited aspects of olfactory behavior; thus, the neural mechanisms regarding the spatio-temporal information processing of olfactory stimuli are still largely unknown.<br/></p><p><br/>The nematode <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> has been widely used to study olfactory behavior. <em>C. elegans</em> shows attractive and repulsive behaviors to odor stimuli, and has a strong advantage for neural studies because of its simple nervous system with complete connectome information (White <em>et al.</em>, 1986; Bargmann <em>et al.</em>, 1993; Bargmann, 2006). <em>C. elegans</em> is also useful for calcium imaging of neural activity because of its transparent body and the availability of various cell-specific promoters to express genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) (Kerr, 2006). Furthermore, recent technical advances have enabled the application of calcium imaging to freely moving <em>C. elegans</em> by using automated tracking of the animal using a motorized stage (Faumont <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Kawano <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Piggott <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Zheng <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Tanimoto <em>et al.</em>, 2016). This method allows for the simultaneous analysis of behavioral output and neural activity, such as motor neuron or command interneuron activity. However, during calcium imaging, it has remained difficult to present a realistic gradual odorant concentration change. A widely used microfluidic flow channel delivers only up-step or down-step odorant stimuli to a physically restricted animal in a small chamber (Chronis <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Systems that deliver gradually changing concentrations of water-soluble chemicals/odorants were recently developed (Albrecht and Bargmann, 2011; Larsch <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Itskovits <em>et al.</em>, 2018), but these odor delivery methods use only the aqueous phase, which differs from the widely used air phase olfactory paradigm (Bargmann, 2006). In addition, such microfluidic channels are not compatible with auto-tracking microscope systems for calcium imaging of freely moving <em>C. elegans</em> at high magnification. Therefore, it has been technically difficult to simultaneously analyze neural activity and behavior in response to naturalistic olfactory stimuli in freely moving <em>C. elegans</em>.<br/></p><p><br/>Here we describe the technical details and protocols of our original calcium imaging microscope system integrated with a specialized odor stimulation device. In this system, temporal changes in odor concentration around the animal are precisely controlled according to predesigned temporal odor gradients to reproduce olfactory stimuli during olfactory behavior. These temporal gradients are designed based on measured odor concentration changes sensed by the animal during actual olfactory navigation behavior in a classic Petri dish experiment (Yamazoe-Umemoto <em>et al.</em>, 2015 and 2018). This odor stimulation device can also be combined with an auto-tracking motorized stage to apply the realistic graded odorant stimuli to freely moving <em>C. elegans</em>. By reproducing realistic odor concentration changes during the measurement of neural activity and behavior, it was possible to elucidate the neural mechanisms that underlie the dynamic aspects of olfactory processing by the nervous system, such as temporal differentiation and integration (Tanimoto <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Our protocol for the repulsive odor 2-nonanone described below should be applicable to other odorants.</p><br/></p>

This system can be used either for a freely moving animal by automated tracking with the motorized stage or for immobilized animals under an anesthetic (levamisole). The animal is exposed to excitation light from a mercury lamp (USH-1030L, Olympus, Japan) through a BP460-495 bandpass-filter (Olympus) and a DM505HQ dichroic mirror (Olympus). This excitation light is weakened to approximately 100 Î¼W/mm<sup>2</sup> (measured by optical power meter HIOKI 3664+9742) with neutral density (ND) filters (Olympus) and used for both GCaMP and mCherry excitation. The fluorescence of GCaMP and mCherry is acquired using the 20Ã UPLFLN objective lens (Olympus) and introduced into a W-View beamsplitter (Hamamatsu, Japan). The W-View contains two dichroic mirrors (545SP and 545LP) and bandpass filters (D520/20m and 620DF35) to split the GCaMP and mCherry fluorescent images (Figure 1). These two images are simultaneously captured side-by-side on an EM-CCD camera ImagEM (Hamamatsu). The fluorescent intensities of GCaMP and mCherry must be set at a similar level; otherwise, fluorescence from the stronger channel may leak to the weaker channel. The mCherry fluorescence is stronger than the GCaMP fluorescence with our optical setup, and the use of blue excitation light, which excites mCherry less efficiently than green excitation light does, can balance the fluorescence intensities of the mCherry and GCaMP. Fluorescent images are taken at a 32.6-ms exposure time and 100-ms sampling interval with 2 Ãâ2 binning.</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3866/bioprotoc-11-01-3866-g001.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. A schematic of the microscope system used for calcium imaging under the controlled odor stimulus.</strong> The system also possesses an auto-tracking function. The system comprises multiple bandpass filters [BP460-495 (Olympus), 32BP775 (Olympus), D520/20m (Chroma), and 620DF35 (Omega)], dichroic mirrors [DM505, 545SP, 545LP (Olympus), and DF670 (Semrock)], and neutral density (ND) filters (Olympus). The W-View enables image-splitting for dual-wavelength imaging using a single camera (Hamamatsu Photonics). The ImagEM electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EM-CCD) camera is used to acquire fluorescent images sensitively (Hamamatsu Photonics).

During imaging, an animal (or multiple immobilized animals) is continuously exposed to an odor flow from a tube end placed ~1 mm away from it. When this system is used with the auto-tracking system, the odor flow from the tube also continuously stimulates the animal since the animal is tracked in the center of the view field (Figure 1). Temporal changes in the 2-nonanone concentration in the odor flow are controlled by two HV-SSP01 syringe pumps (HawkVision, Japan), each holding two 25 ml Gastight syringes (Hamilton) (Figure 2). One pump is used to infuse the 2-nonanone gas, while the other infuses air, and the infused gas and air are mixed through a custom-made microchannel (see Figure 2 and Equipment step 3). The two pumps are programmed to deliver a constant 8 ml/min gas flow in total from the tube end with varying combinations of pump speed to cause the temporal changes in 2-nonanone concentration. For example, when the pump speed for 2-nonanone is changed from 2 ml/min to 5 ml/min, for air it is changed from 6 ml/min to 3 ml/min during the same period. With the 8 ml/min odor flow, the animalâs entire body is exposed to an essentially uniform odor flow without significant stagnation, diffusion, or turbulence. We found that the 8 ml/min air flow rate did not affect the animal's behavior, although stronger flow rates caused aversive responses of the animal. Flow rates slower than 8 ml/min reduce the temporal precision of the temporal odor gradient when measured with a semiconductor odor sensor (see Equipment steps 5-6). The experimental room, particularly around the microscope, must be kept windless during the experiment. The behavior of the odor flow can be visualized by filling fog produced by Wizard Stick (Zero Toys, USA) instead of the odor gas (see Tanimoto <em>et al.</em>, 2017, Video 3).</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3866/bioprotoc-11-01-3866-g002.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

Because 2-nonanone, the odorant we used here, is highly adsorptive, we chose glass, stainless steel, and PFA Teflon to fabricate the microchannel since they are less adsorptive to 2-nonanone. Other kinds of plastics or silicones are highly adsorptive to 2-nonanone, and we avoided using them for the channel.

To vaporize the 2-nonanone, put the liquid in the groove of the metal block at 50 Â°C. A fan stirs the gas so that the volatilized odorant is diffused equally in the tank.</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3866/bioprotoc-11-01-3866-g005.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.

The syringe pump for 2-nonanone with two 2-nonanone syringes produces ~3.0 ÂµM at the maximum speed, although such high concentration is generally not required to produce the measured odor concentration change in the behavioral arena. The syringe pump for 2-nonanone with one 2-nonanone syringe and one air syringe produces ~1.5 ÂµM at maximum speed.</p></li><li><p>Make a draft program of a temporal odor gradient with timepoint (seconds) and corresponding pump speed (ml/min) for each syringe pump for 2-nonanone and air.

Edit the draft program using a text editor and save it as a text file in the main folder of the control PC of the syringe pump HV-SSP01 (HawkVision). The intervals between the timepoints are interpolated linearly by the control program of the pump.

Immediately start measuring the time-course of 2-nonanone vaporization in the tank. Withdraw the gas inside the tank to the odor sensor with the same equipment as that in Step B3 at 8 ml/min and record the voltage output from the sensor for 5 min (Figure 6C, middle panel). Confirm that the time-course of the voltage plateaued after 4 min and adopt the voltage at 5 min for the concentration of 0.51 Î¼M (approximately 25.6 Î¼mol of 2-nonanone added to the 50-L tank).

Subtract the baseline voltage value (final timepoint from Step B3) from the measured voltage values for 0.51, 1.02, 2.04, and 4.09 Î¼M (from Step B4) to obtain four data points (<em>x, y</em>) = (voltage, concentration) for each concentration. Then, fit the four data points by the power approximation and determine parameters <em>a, b</em> of the calibration curve <em>y = ax<sup>b</sup></em> (Figure 6B). The calibration curve will be used to calculate concentration change <em>y(t)</em> from the measured voltage <em>x(t)</em> in the following experiment. Create a calibration curve each experimental day because the parameters <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> gradually change due to the characteristic of the semiconductor sensor.</p><br/></li></ol></li><li><p>Preparation of open agar plates</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>Prepare NGM with 2.5% agar on each day of the experiment.
