            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Seher  Abbas, Karl-Wilhelm  Koch</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Diverse and complex molecular recognitions are central elements of signal transduction cascades. The strength and nature of these interaction modes can be determined by different experimental approaches. Among those, Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) offers certain advantages by providing binding constants and thermodynamic parameters from titration series without a need to label or immobilize one or more interaction partners. Furthermore, second messenger homeostasis involving Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ions requires in particular knowledge about stoichiometries and affinities of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor proteins or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulators, which can be obtained by employing ITC. We used ITC to measure these parameters for a set of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor proteins operating in photoreceptor cells. Here, we present a step wise protocol to (a) measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> interaction with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor guanylate cyclase-activating protein 1, (b) to design an ITC experiment and prepare samples, (c) to remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> nearly completely from Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins without using a chelating agent like EGTA.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a label free method to investigate bio-molecular interaction processes by measuring heat release or heat consumption during a binding process. These processes could occur between different forms of molecules including macromolecules and/or small ligands. The principle design of the measuring device consists of two cells (a reference and sample cell) in an adiabatic jacket. One binding partner is present in the sample cell, while the other interacting molecule is injected into the sample cell. The reference cell contains a buffer solution of water. Temperature differences between sample cell and reference cell are sensed by detectors and an equal temperature between both cells is maintained by a combination of a heater system and a feedback circuit. Interaction of two molecule species either releases or consumes heat, which is detected based on the heater/feedback system. ITC can be applied for example to study a wide range of interaction processes including protein-protein (Pierce <em>et al.</em>, 1999), protein-carbohydrate, protein-DNA, enzyme-substrate and cation-protein (Wiseman <em>et al.</em>, 1989; GarcÃ­a-HernÃ¡ndez <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Kozlov and Lohmann, 2012; Mazzei <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Alternative methods like surface plasmon resonance (SPR), back scattering interferometry or fluorescence-based techniques utilize different principles and each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages. SPR requires immobilization of one binding partner and fluorescence would in most cases need site-specific labelling. ITC is a method of choice to measure direct ion binding to proteins for deriving binding constants. Furthermore, ligand binding or protein-protein interactions can be studied without the need to label or immobilize one binding partner and has also shown promises in drug discovery science (Ward and Holdgate, 2001; Weber and Salemme, 2003; Lim <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Sulmann <em>et al.</em>, 2015). The values extracted from ITC measurements are the binding constants (K<sub>a</sub>), binding stoichiometry (n), free energy (ÎG), enthalpy (ÎH) and entropy (ÎS). In another words, it provides thermodynamic parameters in addition to binding constants. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions play important roles in intracellular signaling, itâs important to understand the intracellular detection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor proteins and to investigate the interaction processes in quantitative terms. Among Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensors, one subgroup of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor (NCS) proteins is important for the primary processes of vision in photoreceptor cells, where they are involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-feedback mechanisms to control deactivation processes and sensitivity of photoreceptor cells to light. Guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) are NCS proteins that regulate the activity of membrane bound guanylate cyclases in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, thereby controlling the cytoplasmic concentration of cyclic GMP, the second messenger of photoexcitation in photorecepotor cells. Several point mutations in GCAP1 lead to severely impaired vision or blindness and amino acid substitutions in different positions appear to cause some common features (Marino <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Vocke <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Marino <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Peshenko <em>et al.</em>, 2019). For example, mutant GCAP1 proteins undergo different conformational changes due to impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding, and it often results in constitutive activity of the GCAP1/guanylate cyclase complex. Eventually it causes an imbalance of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cyclic GMP homeostasis. ITC has been applied for measuring the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> to GCAPs (Lim <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Sulmann <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Peshenko <em>et al.</em>, 2019), but also to recoverin (Dell'Orco <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Abbas <em>et al.</em>, 2019), calmodulin (Beccia <em>et al.</em>, 2015) visinin-like protein 3 (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2016) neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1) (Tsvetkov <em>et al.</em>, 2018) and other Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor proteins. An alternative method specifically developed for measuring Ca<sup>2+</sup>-protein bindings is the Chelator assay, which utilizes the presence of a detectable and titrable Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator (<em>e.g.</em>, BAPTA). It measures the binding between the protein of interest and free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Linse, 2002). Both techniques are to some degree complementary and have been used in combination in a recent publication (Elbers <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>In this protocol, we provide a step-by-step description for using ITC in Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding studies. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor proteins can contain sometimes binding sites of very high affinity, it is a challenging task to remove bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ions nearly completely from the protein. Therefore, we also provide a protocol to decalcify Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor proteins without using a chelating substance like EGTA. This protein decalcification protocol can be used for preparing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins used in other techniques (surface plasmon resonance, backscattering interferometry, and Chelator assay). In general, the protocol defines the essentials to design an ITC experiment and analysis of ITC data.<br/></p>

For this purpose, a solvent filtration device is best suited. The device contains a filter holder and a chamber on top of it. The filtration device is commonly used for filtration of solutions via a pump. Further, a polypyro 0.2 Âµm membrane filter is needed. It is placed on a holder (part of the commercial filtration device) and keeps the chelex resin on top of it, when a vacuum pump is turned on and a washing solution is sucked through the filter. Thereby, it prevents the chelex material flowing into waste. The steps of the regeneration and washing procedure are as follows:<ol class="npwthree"><li>Fill the chamber on top of the filter holder with chelex and wash with 500 ml of double-distilled water.</li><li>Wash the chelex with 200 ml of 1 M HCl.</li><li>Wash chelex with 500 ml of double-distilled water.</li><li>Wash chelex with 200 ml of NaOH.</li><li>Wash chelex with 500 ml of double-distilled water again. Suspend in double-distilled water and transfer the chelex material to a plastic bottle.</li></ol></li><li>Prepare a plastic bottle for chelex storage. Wash the bottle with a solution of 5 mM EGTA. Rinse with water before storing regenerated chelex.</li><li>Adjust the pH of the chelex suspension, it should be neutral (around 7). Otherwise it might harm the protein function of bGCAP1. Adjusting the pH of the chelex material can be a very difficult and time consuming. See Notes for some tips.</li><li>Take a used PD10 column and remove the column material (normally a gel filtration resin) and discard it. There is a small bed at the bottom of the PD10 column. Leave it inside the column. Use 6 M urea to clean the column in case the flow is slow. Fix the column to the column holder and fill it with chelex that is stored in water now (Figure 4). Let the water flows out and all chelex material stays inside the column. Your chelex bench column is ready to use.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327085820_3056.jpg" width="138"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.

It is filled into the PD10 column. B. Chelex is settling by gravity flow. Water or buffer will pass the bed or small platform at the bottom, which retains the chelex material. Any kind of tube can be used for collecting the flow-through.<br/><br/></li></ol></li><li>Remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from bGCAP1 (decalcify)<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Use a pipette for removing bGCAP1 out of the dialysis membrane after overnight dialysis and transfer it to a 15 ml Falcon tube. Check protein concentration with Bradford protein quantification method (Bradford, 1976). Be aware that Coomassie dye-based protein determination methods depend on the nature of the protein used for calibration.<br/><em>Tip: Use a protein specific calibration curve. Create this curve by using your protein of interest as standard. Prepare standard concentrations (1-10 Âµg/ml) by using a second independent method of protein determination for example measuring the UV absorbance. Determine the molar extinction coefficient (Pace and Schmid, 1997) and employ it by using the Lambert-Beer law; see below Step E4.</em> </li><li>Take the chelex bench column and apply bGCAP1 (If the total column volume is 10 ml, 5 ml should be the bGCAP1 solution and 5 ml be the chelex material). Mix chelex with bGCAP1 inside column with slight hand rotations. Either leave the column in a cold room for half an hour or place it for end to end rotation in a cold room keeping bGCAP1 in direct contact with chelex.<br/><em>Note: It is necessary that bGCAP1 is in direct contact with the chelex material for removing Ca</em><sup><em>2+</em></sup><em>.</em> </li><li>Collect bGCAP1 from the column in Eppendorf tubes (2 ml) and label the tubes with protein concentrations after measurement.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Decalcify the ITC buffer<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Prepare another chelex bench column with fresh chelex and fix the column in a column holder.</li><li>Prepare plastic bottle (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-contamination might also originate from plastic material) to collect decalcified ITC buffer as following:<ol class="npwthree"><li>Take any 100-200 ml plastic bottle and wash it with 1 M HCl.</li><li>Rinse the bottle with water.</li><li>Wash bottle again with 5 mM EGTA.</li><li>Rinse the bottle with double-distilled water.</li></ol></li><li>Position the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free plastic bottle under the column and pass 50 ml of ITC buffer (to avoid buffer mismatch prepare a larger stock of dialysis/ITC buffer).</li><li>Check how much Ca<sup>2+</sup> is left in decalcified buffer by determining free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the buffer using BAPTA as indicator. Install WinASPECT spectroanalytical software or use any other running software for a spectrophotometer. Open the program and initialize the program by turning on the UV-lamp. Set the lamp wavelength at 254 nm. Start absorbance measurement with reference sample that contains only buffer. Afterwards, measure absorbance of buffer mixed with BAPTA for three times (separate replicates) and calculate the average.</li><li>Buffer preparation for BAPTA measurements:<ol class="npwthree"><li>Take 500 Âµl of decalcified ITC buffer for reference measurement.</li><li>Take 495 Âµl buffer and mix with 5 Âµl of BAPTA from 1 mM stock.</li><li>vortex the sample.</li></ol></li><li>Calculate free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in buffer with equations listed below:<br/>Total [BAPTA] = [BAPTA<sub>f</sub>] + [CaBAPTA]<br/>[CaBAPTA] = [Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>f</sub>][BAPTA<sub>f</sub>]/K<sub>D</sub>(Ca)<br/>K<sub>D</sub>(Ca) = 107 nM; dissociation constant of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to BAPTA under conditions of the ITC buffer (room temperature 22 Â± 2 Â°C; Tsien, 1980).</li></ol><br/>As a first step, determine the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free BAPTA ([BAPTA<sub>f</sub>] by measuring the absorbance at 254 nm. According to Lambert-Beer's law A = Îµ Ã c Ã l, calculate c, concentration of [BAPTA<sub>f</sub>]; the other parameters are extinction coefficient Îµ = 1.6 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> Ã cm<sup>-1</sup> and l = length of cuvette (<em>e.g.</em>, 1 cm). With [BAPTA<sub>f</sub>] and the known concentration of total [BAPTA] (<em>e.g.</em>, 20 ÂµM) one can calculate [CaBAPTA].<br/>For example, the average value of absorbance might be 0.095.<br/>With A = Îµ Ã c Ã l we obtain<br/>0.095 = 1.6 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> Ã cm<sup>-1</sup> Ã 1 cm<br/>and for concentration c = 5.9 ÂµM<br/>The concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound to BAPTA is<br/>[CaBAPTA] = total [BAPTA] - [BAPTA<sub>f</sub>]<br/>= 10 ÂµM - 5.9 ÂµM<br/>= 4.1 ÂµM<br/>leading to<br/>[Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>f</sub>] = 0.107 ÂµM Ã 4.1 ÂµM/5.9 ÂµM<br/>[Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>f</sub>] = 0.074 ÂµM or 74 nM<br/>A concentration of [Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>f</sub>] of 74 nM might be the lower limit, which can be achieved. A concentration of [Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>f</sub>] below 80 nM in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelating reagents like EGTA might be sufficient for most titrations. One can repeat the whole buffer decalcifying process to achieve this lower limit.<br/><br/></li><li>Prepare the ITC system<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Wash the sample cell (the cavity for GCAP1 protein inside ITC instrument, Figure 5) with 5% Decon (system cleaning detergent). Start with 100 ml of 5% Decon followed by 400 ml of double-distilled water. Remove residual water from the sample cell by inserting the loading syringe (Figure 6) and wash the sample cell with decalcified ITC buffer. Afterwards, fill the sample cell with decalcified ITC buffer and leave it until protein sample is ready. This helps to equilibrate the sample cell and also removes free Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</li><li>Wash the ITC sample syringe that is part of the ITC system (Figure 5) and automatically controlled by software. It contains the ligand or Ca<sup>2+</sup> in our case. Attach a 5 ml small syringe piston (an Omnifix small 5 ml syringe or reciprocating pump, see materials) to the sample syringe port with small plastic tube (Figure 5A). Fill a special ITC tube that comes with the ITC instrument with 5% Decon and fix it in holder under the ITC sample syringe (during titrations the ITC tube carries water to wash the syringe). Use the syringe piston to catch the 5% Decon after passing through the sample syringe. Repeat the same process with at least 30 ml of water to remove any remaining detergent inside.</li><li>Dry the ITC sample syringe. Remove the ITC tube from the syringe holder and let syringe tip stay in air. Use the small syringe piston to pull air through the sample syringe. Remove all drops of waters by repeating the process several times.<br/><em>Tip: Click <em>purge</em> and <em>refill</em> button from software, this process will bring all the water at syringe tip and place a kim wipe at the tip to catch all water.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200327/20200327085910_6443.jpg" width="133"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.

Prepare another chelex column with at least 2 ml of chelex material inside. Add the protein sample to the column and leave it on ice.</li><li>Prepare the sample for filling the ITC sample syringe (Ca<sup>2+</sup> in our case): use calcium standard solution, which is 10 g/L (WTW D-82362 Weilheim) and dilute with decalcified ITC buffer to prepare a Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution with a final concentration of 0.5 mM.</li><li>Collect the bGCAP1 sample from the chelex column in a tube (Tip: every time wash the tubes with decalcified buffer before collecting a bGACP1 sample from the column to avoid any contamination of free calcium that might come from the tube walls). Put small magnet stir bars in the tubes and degas both samples (Ca<sup>2+</sup> and bGCAP1 solution) for at least 10 min. Set the degasser temperature at 25 Â°C as the experiment is also performed at 25 Â°C. Degasser is also part of ITC system and provided by ITC suppliers.</li><li>Reference cell (second cavity inside ITC instrument to hold water or buffer as reference): Fill double-distilled water in a fresh tube and degas it for 10 min. Transfer the water to the reference cell with a loading syringe (the loading syringe is only used to load a protein solution into the sample cell and water or buffer into the reference cell). The syringe also comes with ITC instrument (be very careful to avoid adding air bubbles in cells).<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Load samples<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Fix the tube containing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-solution under the ITC sample syringe and load sample very carefully (Figure 5B). Sometimes a few air bubbles are left inside the sample holder. To avoid trapping of air bubbles, click <em>close port button</em> in the software and pull the piston very carefully at the same time. (This saves sample and avoids adding air bubbles). Click <em>purge</em> and <em>refill</em> button in the software twice to release the entire sample back into the tube and let it slowly load again. This trick removes all small air bubbles.</li><li>Wash the loading syringe with water and remove the entire decalcified ITC buffer from the sample cell, which was used to wash the sample cell. Remove the buffer from the loading syringe and make sure there is no buffer left in the sample cell. Do not touch the loading syringe with anything at this moment and fill it with bGCAP1 sample after degassing. Insert the loading syringe needle into sample cell and release the sample slowly. (Tip: loading sample with the loading syringe can easily create small air bubbles that can affect the measurement. To avoid loading air bubbles proceed as follows: when the sample is visible in the sample reservoir, load back a small volume and release with a short pressure pulse so that all bubbles appear on the top, then remove them). Remove all excess sample from the sample reservoir.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Start the titration experiment<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Hold the ITC sample syringe in one hand and wash its tip with decalcified ITC buffer (the syringe tip was inside the Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution and we need to prevent any contamination of bGCAP1 sample with Ca<sup>2+</sup> before starting the experiment). Use a minimum of 1 ml decalcified ITC buffer to wash the syringe tip. Afterwards, remove extra buffer drops around the syringe tip with kimwipes and place the syringe to the sample cell.<br/><em>Note: Do it very slowly and be very careful not to hit the tip with anything that can bend the tip easily.</em> </li><li>After loading to the sample cell, take a small volume (a few Âµl) of bGCAP1 to check the final protein concentration in case it might have been changed due to previous steps (GCAP1 sample might be diluted due to passing over the chelex column).

These can originate from diluting the ligand into buffer or from injecting a buffer solution into the macromolecule (bGCAP1) solution, whereby dilution of the ligand into the buffer solution is more significant, because ligand concentrations are typically 20 times larger than that of macromolecules.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Load Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution in ITC sample syringe with the same concentration as above (0.5 mM) and load (fill) decalcified ITC buffer in the sample cell.

Record the heat change of dilutions from buffer into macromolecule titration as outlined above.</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32705">### Data analysis</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Binding isotherms are normalized as kcal/mol of ligand and plotted against the molar ratio of macromolecule (Pierce <em>et al.</em>, 1999). For data analysis, use Origin software provided by Malvern MicroCal and upload the experimental and reference files from the corresponding drive of the computer. The experimental isotherm contains heat changes of dilution and also contributions of heat changes from stirring. To correct for heat of dilution it is important to substract the reference isotherm from the experimental isotherm. For this purpose, it is important that all concentrations are the same, when both experimental files are recorded. For example, when bGCAP1 concentration is 20 ÂµM and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is 0.5 mM, in the reference experiment Ca<sup>2+</sup> need to be 0.5 mM and the sample cell must contain the corresponding buffer solutions (indicating a cell concentration of 0 at the time of experiment). Now change the cell concentration to 20 ÂµM as for bGCAP1. Subtract the reference file from experiment that will correct the heat changes originating from dilutions. Afterwards, select a fitting model to fit the ITC binding isotherm based on the number of ligands that bind to the molecule present in the measuring cell. Based on experimental and theoretical evidence one GCAP molecule can bind up to three Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions at EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites EF2, EF3 and EF4 (Hwang <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Peshenko <em>et al.</em>, 2006; DellâOrco <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Selecting the sequential binding model to fit the data will provide fitting parameter for more than two binding sites. One can select as many number of ligands in the sequential binding model as seems appropriate. The Origin software provides two other fitting models (one site model and two site model) that do not account for putative cooperativity between the single binding steps of a ligand.</li><li>Processing the raw data by applying the selected fitting model will yield an integrated binding isotherm as shown in the lower panel of Figure 7. Two parameters of the binding process can be extracted, the change in enthalpy ÎH and the equilibrium constant K<sub>A</sub> (or 1/K<sub>A</sub> = K<sub>D</sub>, dissociation constant). These parameters allow a full thermodynamic characterization according to<br/>ÎG = -<em>RT</em> InK<sub>A</sub> and ÎG = ÎH - TÎS<br/>providing values for free energy (ÎG) and entropy (ÎS). <em>R</em> is the gas constant and <em>T</em> is temperature.<br/>For bGCAP1 three titrations series are performed on a VP-ITC from MicroCal (Northhampton, MA) to determine the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinities. Measurements are done without Mg<sup>2+</sup>.

It was similar to an ITC study by Lim <em>et al.</em> (2015), but differed from recent ITC data observed with human GCAP1 (Figure 7A in Peshenko <em>et al.</em>, 2019), where strong exothermic responses were observed and occasionally much smaller endothermic responses. However, Peshenko <em>et al.</em> (2019) fit their Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding data to a sequential binding model resulting in two apparent dissociation constants. They interpreted their findings with a high affinity binding site in human GCAP1 that is partially or fully occupied in the presence of residual free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in their experiments (90-200 nM). Species differences might account for different Ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinities, which are also observed with previously published data for zebrafish GCAPs in comparison to mammalian GCAP forms (Figure 5 in Sulmann <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/>  Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins can be investigated by the same protocol (see for example Sulmann <em>et al.</em>, 2015 and Peshenko <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32706">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Buffer mismatch can cause a significant experimental error, which can be minimized or avoided by overnight protein dialysis and extensive and careful washing of the system.</li><li>Choice of buffer can be very critical for ITC experiments. Some buffers (<em>e.g.</em>, Tris) show large enthalpy changes of ionization. Thus, measured enthalpy values are a combination of enthalpy coming from complex formation of ligand and macromolecule plus enthalpy of buffer ionization. Use phosphate buffers or HEPES buffer for initial experiments. The ionization enthalpy of sodium phosphate buffer is significantly less than of Tris buffer (1 kcal/mol vs. 11 kcal/mol) (Pierce <em>et al.</em>, 1999).</li><li>Boil dialysis membrane twice in water to make sure EGTA is removed after membrane activation.</li><li>Chelex of white cloudy color indicates when it is ready to use during the regeneration process.</li><li>To adjust the pH of the chelex suspension it is better to start with high molar concentration of HCl or NaOH. When pH is around 6 or 8, use solutions of lower molar concentrations like 1 M HCl or NaOH.</li><li>If the bed (or platform) of the used and recycled PD10 column is clogged and flow of buffer is really slow, apply 6 M urea inside column and leave it for few minutes. Afterwards wash column extensively with water until flow has increased.</li><li>During decalcifying of ITC buffer, pass the same 50 ml twice through the same column to remove the maximum amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</li><li>Always set ITC thermostat temperature at 25 Â°C shortly after turning on the system before starting with other steps of the procedure to save time. Sometimes it takes very long to reach the required temperature.</li><li>During set-up of the ITC system bring three plastic beakers, beaker A with double-distilled water, beaker B with double-distilled water and beaker C for waste. Reason to keep two beakers for water is that every time when washing the system, first wash the syringe in beaker A, then take water from beaker B to wash the system. Proceeding like this avoids contamination of the system with dirty particles.</li><li>Never switch off the system when it is running, ITC syringe will immediately releases all the syringe solution into the sample cell. If something is going wrong, an initial delay can be used to stop the reaction and to start again.</li><li>Be very careful for air bubbles when loading sample, which is why degassing samples twice is effective. Air bubbles can cause poor baseline and can also effect the feedback circuit between reference and sample cells. Do not pipet up and down the protein samples too often as this can create air bubbles.</li><li>When removing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from proteins, passing protein twice to chelex column can increase the efficiency.</li><li>Reference cell can be filled with ITC buffer or just water without macromolecule. Water is an ideal choice, because cleaning of the reference cell is a major issue and often neglected.Double-distilled water brings in much less contamination.</li><li>Load fresh buffer or water in the reference cell on a weekly basis when instrument is in constant use. It is not necessary to change buffer or water in the reference cell after every experiment.</li><li>Always calibrate your pipettes before sample preparations and always use the same pipette set. The ITC experiment is very sensitive concerning any concentration mismatch.</li><li>After finishing experiment wash the system as explained above and fill 300 Âµl of 100% methanol (HPLC grade) into the sample cell. Close the fill port of the syringe before switching off the system.</li><li>To obtain a sigmoidal curve from ITC measurements always check the combination of protein and ligand concentrations. Syringe ligand should be 20 times more concentrated than protein sample in the sample cell. The following equation can be used for designing an experiment. Unitless value <em><strong>c</strong></em> can be in a range from 1 to 1,000. Always increase your protein concentration or decrease the ligand concentration, if <em><strong>c</strong></em> value is around 1. High <em><strong>c</strong></em> values facilitate the determination of an association constant (K<sub>a</sub>) (Wiseman <em>et al.</em>, 1989).<br/><br/><div style="text-align:center;">c = K<sub>a</sub> [M] n</div><br/>[M] is the concentration of the macromolecule<br/>K<sub>a</sub> determines the binding constant for the protein of interest and the ligang, if already known or can be guessed;<br/>n determines the number of ligands binding to the macromolecule.<br/><br/></li><li>It is important to measure both the ligand and macromolecule concentration with high degree of accuracy when determing association constants (K<sub>a</sub>).</li><li>Fitting of data to sequential binding sites using the Origin software is based on Fisher and Singh (1995) and <em>ITC Data Analysis in OriginâTutorial Guide</em>, Version 7.0 (2004) (Reference 10).
