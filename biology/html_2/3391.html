            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Nuclear blood pool imaging using radiolabeled red blood cells has been used in the clinical setting for the evaluation of a number of medical conditions including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, impaired cardiac contractility, and altered cerebrovascular blood flow. Nuclear blood pool imaging is typically performed using Technetium-99m-labeled (<sup>99m</sup>Tc) human erythrocytes (<em>i.e.</em>, the âtagged RBCâ scan) and gamma camera-based planar scintigraphic imaging. When compared to typical clinical planar scintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging platforms, positron emission tomography (PET) provides superior image quality and sensitivity. A number of PET-based radionuclide agents have been proposed for blood pool imaging, but none have yet to be used widely in the clinical setting. In this protocol, we described a simple and fast procedure for imaging the vasculature of immunodeficient mice through a combination of a small animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanner and human erythrocytes labeled with the PET tracer 2-deoxy-2-(<sup>18</sup>F)fluoro-D-glucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG). This technique is expected to have significant advantages over traditional <sup>99m</sup>Tc -labeled erythrocyte scintigraphic nuclear imaging for these reasons. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Gamma camera-based imaging of radiolabeled erythrocyte is often used for visualizing the blood pool in nuclear medicine. For example, <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled human erythrocytes and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled human serum albumin blood pool imaging with planar scintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have been used clinically to evaluate cardiac function (Thrall <em>et al</em>., 1978; Hacker <em>et al</em>., 2006; Mohseni <em>et al</em>., 2015), gastrointestinal bleeding (Sadri <em>et al</em>., 2015), vascular diseases (Liu <em>et al</em>., 2017), and orbital cavernous hemangioma (OCH) (Dong <em>et al</em>., 2017). As PET scanners have superior nuclear tracer sensitivity and image resolution compared to clinical gamma-camera scintigraphy and SPECT scanners (Rahmim and Zaidi, 2008), development of a robust PET-based blood pool imaging method is of significant clinical interest. Various PET tracers have been proposed as blood pool imaging agents, but suffer from certain limitations. For example, 15-oxygen-labeled (<sup>15</sup>O) H<sub>2</sub><sup>15</sup>O, 13-nitrogen-labeled (<sup>13</sup>N) <sup>13</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>, 11-carbon-labeled (<sup>11</sup>C) <sup>11</sup>C-Acetate and 82-rubidium chloride (<sup>82</sup>Rb) have been used to investigate myocardial blood flow, but are not widely used clinically, as the short radioactive half-life of <sup>15</sup>O (122 seconds), <sup>13</sup>N (9.97 minutes), <sup>82</sup>Rb (76 seconds), and <sup>11</sup>C (= 20.334 minutes) require the presence of a cyclotron in close proximity to the PET scanner or to an <sup>82</sup>Rb generator. (Herrero <em>et al</em>., 2006; Nakazato <em>et al</em>., 2013; Lee <em>et al</em>., 2017). As the positron emitter 18-fluorine (<sup>18</sup>F) has a tracer half-life (108 minutes) well-suited for clinical imaging, <sup>18</sup>F-based tracers are considered attractive for PET imaging, especially given the wide spread prevalence of FDG-specific PET imaging for oncology patients, as well as other <sup>18</sup>F-based agents, such as <sup>18</sup>F-fluorothymidine (<sup>18</sup>F-FLT) used for visualizing tumor proliferation (Cysouw <em>et al</em>., 2017). <br/><br/>In this protocol, we describe the method for labeling human erythrocytes with FDG and washing the FDG-labeled erythrocytes. We also describe the injection of labeled erythrocytes into NSG<sup>TM</sup> immunodeficient mice and subsequent imaging of the mouse vasculature using a small animal microPET/CT platform. Given that the erythrocyte labeling and washing procedure is straightforward, and that the FDG leakage rate from labeled erythrocytes is relatively slow (~10% in 46 min), we believe this method allows for robust PET imaging of the mouse vasculature. We believe that this imaging technique would be of interest to investigators seeking to visualize the vasculature of immunodeficient mice for other applications. In addition, we speculate that this technique would offer significant advantages over <sup>99m</sup>Tc-based nuclear blood pool imaging for the evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding in patients, and may be useful for evaluating other clinical pathologies, including those involving the cerebral and myocardial vasculature.</p>

Other immunodeficient mouse strains have not been tested, but may be feasible as well.</em> </li><li>Add 100 Âµl <sup>18</sup>F-FDG solution to each RBC cryovial (F.V. = 500 Âµl) behind appropriate radioactivity shielding. Methods for handling radioactive materials for this protocol should follow those established by the radiation safety officer at your institution. Directly count radioactivity in each cryovial using the AtomLab<sup>TM</sup> dose calibrator (mCiâs) and record the time. The amount of activity should be at least 1 mCi of FDG in each vial. Ensure the cap is tightly screwed on the cryovial. Care should be taken when choosing an appropriate vial for FDG RBC labeling, as some cryovials are composed of certain plastics that do not maintain a good seal about the cap when exposed to higher temperatures and can result in local radioactivity leakage/contamination. A thin strip of Parafilm<sup>TM</sup> can be wrapped around the margins of the cap to ensure no radioactivity leakage from the tube and reduce water loss from the cryovial lumen.</li><li>Gently finger resuspend RBCs. Place vials in an upright position in a tube rack tied/taped to a rotator platform as Figure 4. Incubate rotating samples in an upright position at 37 Â°C for 30 min at â¤ 60 RPM. Avoid inverting tube during rotation, as this likely increases the amount of dried cells adherent to the tube wall.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926014631_3662.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.

Typical amounts of intracellular radiotracer activity are limited by the total allowable volume of cell solution (250 Âµl pelleted RBCs) that can be injected into a mouse per day as per our institutional IACUC guidelines, but usually range from ~150 to 300 ÂµCuries, and can be higher depending upon the chosen <sup>18</sup>F-FDG specific activity at the start of cell labeling. Gently resuspend the pellet in 250 Âµl of 1x EDTA solution. The labeling of two RBC samples allows for titration of a larger volume of labeled RBCs, as needed.</li><li>Transfer the RBC suspension to a 1 ml syringe using a 22 gauge needle. Any residual clumps of cells should not be aspirated, as these likely represent damaged/coagulated cells. Cells should be slowly aspirated into the syringe lumen to minimize mechanical damage/shear injury to cells. The radioactivity in the syringe should be measured before and after animal injection to determine net activity injected <em>in vivo</em>, as there will be residual activity left in the syringe after injection.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Small animal PET/CT imaging<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Prepare 4-6 week-old male splenectomized NODSCIDgamma (NSG<sup>TM</sup>) immunodeficient mice for experiment.</li><li>The mouse can be fasted the night before PET/CT imaging to encourage shifting of mouse metabolic activity from glucose to fatty acids, thus minimizing myocardial uptake of any free FDG in the labeled cell preparation. The mouse can also be placed on a very low carbohydrate diet for this purpose as well, as needed. Draw 500 Âµl of mouse blood through retro-orbital venous plexus puncture, or other approved venous blood draw at your institution, as seen in the example shown in Figure 7. Blood should be collected into heparinized blood collection tube. If the blood is drawn too slowly, there is a risk of significant coagulation occurring, rendering the blood sample unsuitable for FDG labeling. Measure blood glucose level with a blood glucose monitor for PET calibration.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926014724_4250.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 7.

The lowest level of inhalational isoflurane possible is recommended, as isoflurane may induce vasodilation of the mouse vasculature. Record the level of inhalational isoflurane used per mouse.</li><li>Warm the mouse tail with either a warm soaked towel to stimulate dilation of the mouse tail veins. Insert a tail vein micro-catheter into one of the dilated mouse tail veins. Flush tail vein catheter with 1 U/ml heparin-PBS solution.
