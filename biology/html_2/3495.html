            <h1>Bone-in-culture Array to Model Bone Metastasis in <em>ex vivo</em> Condition</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hai Wang, Xiang H.-F. Zhang</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Bone is the most frequently affected organ by metastases of breast cancer and prostate cancer. Our knowledge on bone metastasis is extremely limited due to the lack of potent and efficient experimental models. We developed the âBone-In-Culture Array (BICA)â platform to model the bone colonization of cancer cells in <em>ex vivo</em> cultures. The use of the BICA platform will facilitate in-depth mechanistic studies and high-throughput screening of drugs for bone metastasis.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Bone metastasis research is extremely limited due to the lack of efficient and faithful experimental models (Weigelt <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Simmons <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Current <em>in vivo</em> bone metastasis models require extensive surgical labor, rendering high-throughput assays impossible (Blouin <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Simmons <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Kuchimaru <em>et al.</em>, 2018). <em>In vitro</em> systems, on the other hand, cannot recapitulate the cellular and molecular complexity of the bone microenvironment (Taubenberger, 2014; Cunningham and You, 2015). To complement existing systems, we developed the BICA platform to investigate mechanisms involved in bone colonization and to rapidly test drug efficacies on bone metastases (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2016).<br/><br/>BICA is performed by selectively delivering cancer cells into the hind limbs of mice via the external iliac artery followed by extracting and fragmenting the cancer-containing bones and exposing the bone fragments to <em>ex vivo</em> cultures (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2016). The cancer cell growth in BICA will then be determined using bioluminescence signals. Our previous work has established that BICA recapitulates <em>in vivo</em> bone metastases characteristics, including the microenvironmental niche, gene expression profile, metastatic growth kinetics, and therapeutic responses (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Therefore, BICA as a reliable and high-throughput experimental platform to investigate bone metastases processes in breast cancer and prostate cancer or even other cancer types that can potentially give rise to bone metastases.</p>

We typically use Firefly luciferase tagged cancer cells, whose progression can be monitored by bioluminescence signal. The preparation of luciferase-tagged cancer cells was described in our previous study (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Briefly, replace the GFP domain of pwpt-GFP (Addgene #12255) with Fluc-GFP fusion gene. Transfect 293T cells with 5 Âµg pwpt-Fluc-GFP vector, along with 1.75 Âµg pMD2.G (Addgene #12259) and 3 Âµg psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) in a 10 cm cell culture dish to package lentivirus. After 48 h, filter the supernatant through 0.45 Âµm polyethersulfone membranes (VWR), which will serve as lentiviral stocks. Treat the cancer cells with Fluc-GFP lentivirus and 4 mg/ml polybrene for 8 h. After a 72 h culture period, isolate the GFP-positive cells by FACS. Cells are maintained by following their corresponding culture protocols.<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Upon harvesting, trypsinize (with Trypsin 0.25% Solution), wash and resuspend cancer cells to a concentration of 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in ice-cold, sterilized saline (Teknova).</li><li>Keep cell suspensions on ice.</li></ol></li><li>Mice preparation<br/>Choose mice in the appropriate gender and ages based on the purpose of the conducted research. Of note, the immune rejection between different species (<em>e.g.</em>, human and mice) or stains will not be preserved in <em>ex vivo</em> culture. Therefore, researcher may have more permissive choice in determining the mice strains to use.<br/>The anesthesia and aseptic procedure should follow the standard operation procedure approved by IACUC in the researcherâs institute.</li><li>IIA injection procedure<br/>In this step, we selectively inject cancer cells via the external iliac artery and thereby loading the cancer cells into the hind limb of mice. Here we briefly introduce the major steps of IIA as the basic work for BICA samples preparation. The details of this procedure are elaborately described in our previous publications (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2016), which is out of the main scope of this study.<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Restrain the anesthetized mice on a diaper or plastic board.</li><li>Make a skin incision of 1.5 cm between the 4th and 5th nipples in the lower right abdomen.</li><li>Perform blunt dissection to separate muscles and expose the common iliac artery under the dissection microscope.</li><li>Inject 0.1 ml cell suspension into the iliac artery using 31 G needles.</li></ol></li><li>Stop bleeding by pressing injected artery with cotton tips (in about 10 min). This step may take 5-10 min.</li><li>Leave the mouse on a warm heating pad under anesthesia and aseptic condition for 30 min, allowing the cancer cells homing to the favorable niches.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="103" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200112/20200112101122_9415.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

These parts are bone tissues mostly enriching colonized cancer cells.</li><li>Crush the bone tissues with a sterilized bone plier (F.S.T.), trim the bone fragments with dissecting scissor (Roboz) to an even size (0.5-1.5 mm in diameter).<br/><em>Note: Due to the tight interaction already formed between cancer cell and bone matrix, cancer cells are confined within bone fragments during this time. However, do not leave the samples exposed in the air for longer than 5 min.</em><br/></li><li>Quickly transfer the bone fragments to low-attachment 96-well plates preloaded with 200 Âµl culture media (one piece per well). If necessary, randomize bone fragments from multiple mice in different group settings.<br/><br/></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>(Optional) Observation of the baseline intensity by bioluminescence imaging<br/>Researchers in lack of experience may create large deviation on fragment size and cancer loads correspondingly. In this scenario, the bioluminescence intensity data observed later can be divided over the Day 0 (or Day 1) signal intensity of the same piece to yield normalized values, which will help to reduce the intragroup deviation.<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Bioluminescence imaging<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Use multi-pipette to add 10x luciferase substrate D-Luciferin into sample wells.</li><li>Image the plate with an IVIS Lumina II machine.

Therefore, every time after imaging, we need to change the media to remove the residual substrate.<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Use multi-pipette to remove the medium along the wall of wells.

Usually, murine cancer cells progress faster than human cells; Breast cancer cells progress faster than prostate cancer cells; both of which are in agreement with their growth kinetics <em>in vivo</em>.<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>BICA Culture<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Culture the BICA samples in a 37 Â°C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> supply. In studies monitoring cancer biology in low oxygen conditions, a hypoxia chamber can be used in place of the cell culture incubator.</li><li>Change the media every 3-4 days, or when media turns orange-yellow.</li><li>Measure the BICA plate at least once a week by bioluminescence imaging.</li><li>The traits of bone residual cells can be maintained for as long as 2 months.</li></ol></li><li>Bioluminescence imaging<br/>The bone-colonized cancer cells are usually tightly anchored into the bone matrix. Floating cancer cells are very rare, which wonât interrupt the measurement of bioluminescence intensity.<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Use multi-pipette to add 10x luciferase substrate D-Luciferin into sample wells.</li><li>Image the plate with IVIS Lumina II machine.

Avoid fragment aspiration.</li><li>Add 200 Âµl fresh culture media into each well.<br/></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) imaging<br/>The IHC/IF staining is one of the extensional applications of BICA. If needed, fix the BICA tissues with 4% Paraformaldehyde overnight and decalcify them with 14% EDTA for five days. Paraffin-embed the samples for micro-sectioning. ALP and CTSK can serve as markers for osteoblast and osteoclast individually. More details can be found in our previous studies (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2015, 2017 and 2018).</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti31092">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz">The bioluminescence intensity data observed later can be interpreted by either raw or normalized intensities.
