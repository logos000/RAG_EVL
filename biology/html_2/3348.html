            <h1>A Novel Dual Lentiviral CRISPR-based Transcriptional Activation System for  Gene Expression Regulation in Neurons</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Katherine E. Savell, Faraz A. Sultan, Jeremy J. Day</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Robust and efficient gene expression control enables the study of a geneâs function in the central nervous system. Advances in CRISPR-based technology provide new avenues not only for gene editing, but for complex transcriptional control. Here, we describe a protocol to generate high-titer lentiviruses with neuron-optimized CRISPR-activation constructs (dual lentiviruses consisting of a gene-specific single guide RNA and the CRISPR-activator) for use in primary neurons <em>in vitro</em> or in the adult brain <em>in vivo</em>. This protocol enables modular, scalable, and multiplexable gene regulation in the nervous system and does not require a transgenic model organism. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The study of gene expression in the central nervous system is challenging due to difficulties in transgene delivery in post-mitotic neurons. Approaches to induce gene expression have typically relied on the use of transgenic animal models (Ericsson <em>et al</em>., 2013) and viral overexpression vectors (Prelich, 2012). These techniques are resource and time-consuming to make, neglect the endogenous gene locus, are limited by viral cargo capacities, and generally only target one gene at a time. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has been adapted to recruit effector proteins, such as transcriptional activators, to enable precise control over transcription (Chavez <em>et al</em>., 2015; Savell and Day, 2017). We recently optimized a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for robust, specific, titratable, and multiplexable gene induction in neurons both <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> by adapting available CRISPRa tools to be expressed with a dual lentivirus approach (Savell <em>et al</em>., 2019). This dual lentivirus system is composed of lentiviruses containing a gene-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) and the dCas9-VPR (a strong transcriptional activator). Multiplexing at a single gene involves recruiting multiple dCas9-VPR effectors to a single geneâs promoter to boost transcription of that gene by pooling sgRNAs targeting the same gene. Multiplexing multiple genes is possible through combining sgRNAs targeting each of the desired genes.<br/> <br/>This protocol is divided into subsections to outline 1) identification of sgRNA targeting sequences for CRISPRa and cloning the targeting sequence into the sgRNA scaffold, 2) maintaining and using HEK293T cells for lentivirus production, 3-4) lentivirus preparations on different scales for use <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>, 5) transduction guidelines for <em>in vitro</em> applications, 6) Transduction of adult neurons <em>in vivo</em>.<br/></p>

Insertion of the gene-speciï¬c targeting sequence into the sgRNA scaffold.</strong> A. A targeting region is selected within 500 bp of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of a gene of interest by a publicly available CRISPR/dCas9 target site selection tool. The targeting sequence is immediately adjacent to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and is required for spCas9 targeting. B. Oligos containing the target site and the unique <em>BbsI</em> overhangs are (top) annealed and (bottom) phosphorylated to create a dsDNA fragment for insertion into the sgRNA scaffold plasmid. C. The Lenti U6-sgRNA/Ef1a-mCherry plasmid is digested by <em>BbsI</em> and dephosphorylated (top), then the annealed targeting sequence is ligated into the cut backbone (bottom). D. After the plasmid is transformed and ampliï¬ed, a PCR reaction is performed to validate correct insertion of the targeting sequence.<br/></p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Utilize a publicly available CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA prediction tool (We recommend <u>CHOPCHOP</u> or <u>e-CRISP</u>) to target within 2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site (TSS) of the gene, typically referred to as the promoter region.

Our standard procedure involves the transduction of an MOI of 1,000 for both the sgRNA and the dCas9-VPR lentiviruses of 125,000 primary neurons seeded into each well of a 24-well plate (Savell <em>et al</em>., 2019).<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>We have not exhaustively tested different ratios of sgRNA:dCas9-VPR and find that a 1:1 seems to work well.

You may also add a higher MOI of the dCas9-VPR lentiviruses to account for each gene, but we have not tested this thoroughly. Include an increased MOI non-targeting control (We recommend the bacterial <em>LacZ</em> gene).<br/><em>Example: If targeting 2 genes at once, transduce with an MOI of 1000 for each gene-specific sgRNA and 1000-2000 for the dCas9-VPR construct.
