            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p> Transgenic mice have been used to make valuable contributions to the field of neuroscience and model neurological diseases. The simultaneous functional analysis of hippocampal cell activity combined with hippocampal dependent innate task evaluations provides a reliable experimental approach to detect fine changes during early phases of neurodegeneration. To this aim, we used a merge of patch-clamp with two hippocampal innate behavior tasks. With this experimental approach, whole-cell recordings of CA1 pyramidal cells, combined with hippocampal-dependent innate behaviors, have been crucial for evaluating the early mechanism of neurodegeneration and its consequences. Here, we present our protocol for <em>ex vivo</em> whole-cell recordings of CA1 pyramidal cells and hippocampal dependent innate behaviors in an adolescent (p30) mice.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Transgenic mice have been widely used to study the cellular and behavioral alterations underlying complex brain disorders, such as Alzheimerâs Disease (AD) (Mahar <em>et al.</em>, 2017; MondragÃ³n-RodrÃ­guez <em>et al.</em>, 2018a, 2018b and 2019). The current and most accepted hypothesis regarding AD pathophysiology upholds that accumulation of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) lead to neurotoxicity and abnormally phosphorylated tau (pTau) in the hippocampus (Ittner <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Additionally, several studies have suggested that protein aggregation correlates with cell damage and the cognitive deficits that characterize AD development (Selkoe, 1990; Oddo <em>et al.</em>, 2003; LaFerla <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Ittner <em>et al.</em>, 2010; MondragÃ³n-RodrÃ­guez <em>et al.</em>, 2014). However, there is evidence demonstrating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation due to presenilin (PS) mutation occurs prior to the formation of AÎ² plaques and pTau accumulation (review in Tong <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Hashimoto <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Thus, electrophysiological data demonstrated that the PS holoprotein itself functions as a passive ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak channel that is impaired in mutant PS leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload (review in Tong <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Hashimoto <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Of relevance, the activities of the major kinases involved in tau phosphorylation are Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent (review in Tong <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>PS is ubiquitously found in cellular membranes, including the ER membrane (review in Tong <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Hashimoto <em>et al.</em>, 2018). PS mutation disrupts ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (InsP<sub>3</sub>R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) that elevate cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, therefore, affecting synaptic transmission and brain activity (review in Tong <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Hashimoto <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that changes in brain activity, potentially leading to hippocampal memory alterations, occurs before any clear neurodegenerative signs appear (Mucke and Selkoe., 2012; PeÃ±a-Ortega <em>et al.</em>, 2012; MondragÃ³n-RodrÃ­guez <em>et al.</em>, 2013, 2017, 2018a and 2018b). In this regard, we have reported that brain activity self-generated in the hippocampus is affected before the detection of cognitive dysfunctions (MondragÃ³n-RodrÃ­guez <em>et al.</em>, 2018a, 2018b and 2019). Specifically, we found that CA1 pyramidal neurons from an adolescent transgenic mouse model showed less spike accommodation and increased subthreshold membrane oscillations (MondragÃ³n-RodrÃ­guez <em>et al.</em>, 2018a).<br/> <br/>To achieve these findings, patch-clamp recordings of pyramidal cells were performed (first group), and hippocampal dependent innate behaviors were assessed in a p30 (postnatal day 30) transgenic AD mouse model (second group) (Oddo <em>et al.</em>, 2003).<br/><br/>To evaluate how pyramidal cells are challenged during the early stages of AD development, we performed electrophysiological analyses of their intrinsic properties (MondragÃ³n-RodrÃ­guez <em>et al.</em>, 2018a). Action potential properties were examined using depolarizing current steps of increasing amplitude. Additionally, subthreshold oscillations in pyramidal cells, which are the main constituents of subthreshold-level activity (PeÃ±a <em>et al.</em>, 2010; V-Ghaffari <em>et al.</em>, 2016) were evaluated.<br/> <br/>To address the cognitive state (hippocampal-dependent function) of p30 transgenic mice we performed burrowing and nesting tests (Salgado-Puga <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Gjendal <em>et al.</em>, 2019). While, typical hippocampal-dependent tests, such as the morris water maze, are not reliable in p30 mice, burrowing and nesting are examples of highly motivated innate behaviors in rodents (Deacon, 2012; Salgado-Puga <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Additionally, both paradigms have proven to be a reliable assay for monitoring the development of brain diseases in mice (Deacon <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Orta-Salazar <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Salgado-Puga <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Thus, deterioration in the ability to perform activities of daily living is an early sign of AD development (Lilamand <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Although several protocols exist in the literature, here we simplify and explain the procedures used by our research group with a well-defined scoring system applicable to p30 mice.</p>

At the end of the infusion, decapitate the animal and remove the brain in ice-cold aCSF. To obtain para-sagittal slices (Figures 4 and 5), remove the cerebellum and brainstem, separate the brain hemispheres and glue them by their medial portion at a 30Â° angle (Figures 4 and 5). First, glue the brain to a piece of filter paper and then, glue the filter paper (with the brain) to the agar block (Figures 4 and 5, agar size tends to vary according to brain size). Throughout this process, the brain tissue should be immersed in normal aCSF with continuous bubbled with carbogen.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218151549_5616.jpg" width="199"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.

The biological signals are measured through an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Always focus recordings on neurons located in the CA1 pyramidal area (CA1 has the least heterogeneous neuronal population and the pyramidal cells are arranged into well-defined layers, see MondragÃ³n-RodrÃ­guez <em>et al.</em>, 2018a). Once the whole-cell configuration is achieved, hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses are applied to evaluate the intrinsic properties of the recorded neurons (Figures 10 and 11). During this current injection protocol, the neurons remained at the original resting potential (variable between neurons). However, the same protocol was repeated while the cells had a -70 mV membrane potential, which was achieved mostly by applying hyperpolarizing current (for whole-cell patch-clamp video see Sunstrum and Inoue, 2019).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200218/20200218152107_9121.jpg" width="356"/><br/><strong>Figure 10.

To compare all neurons, the minimal depolarizing current injection required to evoke at least one AP (rheobase) is multiplied by two to quantify the frequency of the AP evoked by current injection.</li><li>Fire frequency adaptation is calculated by dividing T2/T1, where T2 is the time between the last two APs of a train and T1 is the time elapsed between the first two APs of the same train.

Three categories are defined based on those proposed by Deacon (2012), exemplified next:<br/>Assign category 1 when the nestlet is not noticeably made (Figure 13A, &gt;90% intact cotton). Assign category 2 when the nestlet is partially torn up (50 to 90 % of the cotton was shredded), with or without identifiable nesting (Figure 13B). Assign category 3 when a (near) perfect, crater-shaped nest is formed with walls higher than the mouseâs body weight, allowing the animal to curl up in the nest with more than 50% of its circumference (Figure 13C, &gt;90% shredded cotton).
