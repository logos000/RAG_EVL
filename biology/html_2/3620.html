            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p> T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that arises from transformation of T-cell primed hematopoietic progenitors. Although T-ALL is a heterogenous and molecularly complex disease, more than 65% of T-ALL patients carry activating mutations in the <em>NOTCH1</em> gene. The majority of T-ALLâassociated <em>NOTCH1</em> mutations either disrupt the negative regulatory region, allowing signal activation in the absence of ligand binding, or result in truncation of the C-terminal PEST domain involved in the termination of NOTCH1 signaling by proteasomal degradation. To date, retroviral transduction models have relied heavily on the overexpression of aggressively truncated variants of <em>NOTCH1</em> (such as ICN1 or ÎE-NOTCH1), which result in supraphysiological levels of signaling activity and are rarely found in human T-ALL. The current protocol describes the method for mouse bone marrow isolation, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSC) enrichment, followed by retroviral transduction with an oncogenic mutant form of the NOTCH1 receptor (NOTCH1-L1601P-ÎP) that closely resembles the gain-of-function mutations most commonly found in patient samples. A hallmark of this forced expression of constitutively active <em>NOTCH1</em> is a transient wave of extrathymic immature T-cell development, which precedes oncogenic transformation to T-ALL. Furthermore, this approach models leukemic transformation and progression <em>in vivo</em> by allowing for crosstalk between leukemia cells and the microenvironment, an aspect unaccounted for in cell-line based <em>in vitro</em> studies. Thus, the HSC transduction and transplantation model more faithfully recapitulates development of the human disease, providing a highly comprehensive and versatile tool for further <em>in vivo</em> and <em>ex vivo</em> functional studies.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor arising from the malignant transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells primed towards T-cell development. T-ALL accounts for up to 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and occurs more frequently in males than females (Goldberg <em>et al.</em>, 2003). Despite being characterized by a high level of heterogeneity and molecular complexity (Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2017), more than 65% of T-ALL patients carry gain-of-function mutations in the <em>NOTCH1</em> gene (Weng <em>et al.</em>, 2004). The resulting constitutive activation of NOTCH1 signaling is therefore the most prominent oncogenic pathway in T-cell transformation.<br/><br/>NOTCH1 proteins are developmentally conserved type I transmembrane receptors that play a prominent instructive role in T-cell lineage commitment and cell growth and proliferation during thymocyte development (Radtke <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Defto and Bevan, 2000). NOTCH1 signaling is initiated upon binding of transmembrane ligands expressed on the surface of neighboring cells. This interaction prompts cleavage of the extracellular domain of the receptor by the ADAM10 metalloprotease followed by Î³-secretase cleavage in the transmembrane domain of the receptor. Subsequent release from the membrane results in translocation of the intracellular domain (ICN1) to the nucleus and transcriptional activation of target genes (Kopan and Ilagan, 2009; Andersson <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Finally, termination of NOTCH1 signaling is regulated by phosphorylation of the C-terminal PEST domain, which targets ICN1 for ubiquitination and FBXW7-mediated proteasomal degradation (O'Neil <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Thompson <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Constitutive activation of NOTCH1 in human T-ALL results from disruption of the mechanisms stringently regulating this multi-step process. The majority of T-ALL-associated mutations result either in disruption of the negative regulatory region, resulting in NOTCH1-signaling activation in the absence of ligand binding, or truncation of the C-terminal PEST domain which allows ICN1 to evade proteasomal degradation, thus impairing termination of signaling activity (Weng <em>et al.</em>, 2004). In the past decade, the introduction of intensive combination chemotherapy approaches has increased the cure rate of pediatric T-ALL to nearly 90%. Nonetheless, the prognosis for patients with primary refractory or relapse T-ALL remains very poor (Goldberg <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Litzow and Ferrando, 2015), underscoring the need to further decipher the molecular pathology underlying T-ALL transformation, identification of more specific therapeutic targets, and development of more effective and less toxic multi-drug therapies.<br/><br/>To date, <em>in vitro</em> human T-ALL-derived cell-line cultures remain the most commonly employed experimental approach to the study of T-ALL. Notably, this model does not correct for genetic drift associated with decade-long periods of culture and fails to account for the crosstalk between leukemia cells and the tumor microenvironment (Passaro <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Pitt <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Animal models therefore provide an alternative approach to functional studies that more accurately recapitulate human T-ALL <em>in vivo</em>. The mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) retroviral transduction and transplantation model has been extensively applied to mimic initiation and progression of NOTCH1-driven T-ALL (Wendorff <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Medyouf <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Gachet <em>et al.</em>, 2013). It has been shown that retroviral expression of ICN1 or ÎE-NOTCH1 (the extracellular domain-truncated form of the receptor) in murine bone marrow progenitors drives thymus-independent T-cell development and rapidly induces T-ALL development (Pear <em>et al.</em>, 1996; Perez-Garcia <em>et al.</em>, 2013). However, it should be noted that these aggressively truncated variants of NOTCH1, which result in supraphysiological levels of signaling activity, are rarely found in human T-ALL (Chiang <em>et al.</em>, 2008). In fact, ÎE-NOTCH1 truncated alleles are expressed in only a small subset of patients carrying chromosomal translocations (1%) (Ellisen <em>et al.</em>, 1991; Palomero <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Much more commonly, human T-ALLs harbor acquired gain-of-function point mutations, which occur predominantly within the extracellular HD and the C-terminal PEST domains (Weng <em>et al.</em>, 2004). Of note, 20% of T-ALL patients exhibit co-occurrence of these two mutation-driven activating mechanisms, which generate levels of activity well below those of ÎE-NOTCH1 (Chiang <em>et al.</em>, 2008). As the outcome of NOTCH signaling is highly dose dependent in many developmental settings (Artavanis-Tsakonas <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Bray, 2016), we hypothesized that the level of activity has a similar impact on the process of leukemogenesis. The current protocol describes the method for mouse hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) retroviral transduction with an oncogenic mutant NOTCH1 receptor (NOTCH1-L1601P-ÎP) that closely resembles the gain-of-function mutations found in patient samples. The L1601P-ÎP mutant contains a common HD point mutation (L1601P) that enables ligand-independent activation (Malecki <em>et al.</em>, 2006), together with a frameshift mutation that results in truncation of amino acids 2,473-2,555, which comprise the negative regulatory PEST domain (ÎP). We outline the method for isolation of bone marrow cells from mice, enrichment for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, followed by retroviral transduction and transplantation into isogenic recipients (Figure 1). In this model, forced expression of constitutively active mutant NOTCH1 typically results in a wave of extrathymic T-cell lymphopoiesis 3 weeks after transplantation, which manifests as the transient appearance of GFP<sup>+</sup> preleukemic CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) immature T cells in peripheral blood (Figure 4). Transformation resulting in lethal leukemia progression occurs 12-15 weeks following transplantation (Wendorff <em>et al.</em>, 2019) (Figure 4). When combined with constitutive- or inducible-knockout transgenic models, the protocol can be easily modified to address the role of candidate genes in NOTCH1-driven T-ALL transformation, tumor initiation and tumor progression (Wendorff <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Furthermore, this approach provides a rapid and efficient model system for pre-clinical assessment of potential novel anti-leukemic drugs (Herranz <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Sanchez-Martin <em>et al.</em>, 2017).</p>

lymphoid or myeloid leukemia in mice. Transformation efficiency, kinetics of disease progression and tumor penetrance will depend on both the tumorigenicity of the oncogene used and experimental variables, such as the number of transplanted transduced hematopoietic stem cells.<br/><em>Note: Please refer to the <strong>Notes section</strong> of this protocol for additional information and see Figure 4 for a comparison of the pMSCV-NOTCH1-L1601P-ÎP and ÎE-NOTCH1 leukemia models (recommended cell numbers, kinetics of leukemia development and penetrance).</em><br/><br/>The procedure described here has been optimized for modeling T-ALL development driven specifically by the L1601P-ÎP mutant form of the NOTCH1 receptor. For example, transfection of 293T cells is modified to account for reduced transfection efficiency when using larger constructs, such as the pMSCV-NOTCH1-L1601P-ÎP-ires-GFP (&gt; 15 kb) and counteract the resulting reduction in viral titer. Furthermore, the protocol recommends bone marrow isolation from the hip bones and spinal vertebrae, in addition to the tibiae and femurs. This approach greatly increases the total number of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells available for subsequent transduction, while simultaneously reducing the number of experimental animals needed. Although all mice listed in this protocol (both donor and recipient mice) are on the C57BL/6 background, other mouse strains may be used if bone marrow donor and recipient mice are on congenic genetic backgrounds. However, it is important to remember that each strain has unique background alleles that may interact with and modify the expression of a mutation, transgene or other genetic insert (<a href="https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2006/june/the-importance-of-genetic-background-in-mouse-based-biomedical-research" target="_blank">https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2006/june/the-importance-of-genetic-background-in-mouse-based-biomedical-research</a>).<br/><br/>Please note that the experimental procedure outlined in this protocol requires 6 consecutive days of hands-on activity (Days 0-5), with a subsequent follow-up on Day 21 (Figures 1A and 1B; Figure 4).<br/><br/><em>Important: All experimental procedures must be approved by the local animal care committee.</em><br/><em>Notes:</em> </p><ol class="npwtwo"><li><em>Prior to beginning the protocol, calculate the number of bone marrow donor mice needed based on the desired number of recipient animals; as a ârule of thumbâ, when harvesting marrow from only the <u>2 hind legs</u>, n = 1 bone marrow donor is sufficient for transplantation into n = 2-3 recipient animals; when harvesting marrow from <u>all bones</u> (hind and fore limbs, pelvic bone and spinal column), n = 1 bone marrow donor is sufficient for transplantation into n = 6-8 recipient animals.</em> </li><li><em>An additional untreated congenic wild-type mouse is needed as a source of helper bone-marrow cells on Day 5 of the protocol.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200512/20200512031645_3195.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

The 293T cells produce an ecotropic retrovirus specific for mouse cells, but not entirely ineffective for human cells, necessitating stringent observation of BSL-2 biohazard conditions.</li><li>This protocol was optimized using the jetPEI transfection reagent. Alternative transfection systems may be used successfully but will require individual optimization.</li><li>Here we outline the generation of oncogenic NOTCH1-L1601P-ÎP-driven tumors. Due to the &gt; 15kb size of this retroviral construct, it is difficult to achieve transduction efficiency of bone marrow progenitor cells that exceeds 10% (GFP<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup>). A robust 70-80% frequency of transformation is achieved upon transplantation of 100,000 transduced progenitor cells, which is preceded by 45 Â± 20% GFP<sup>+</sup> pre-leukemia blasts in peripheral blood on day 21 (Figures 4A and 4B). Tumor progression commonly results in mortality 12-25 weeks post-transplant, reflecting kinetically more variable tumor development when compared to ÎE-NOTCH1-driven T-ALL (Figure 4C). When using the highly oncogenic constitutively active ÎE-NOTCH1 allele, transduction efficiency of HSCs falls in the 30 Â± 10% range, resulting in 100% transformation efficiency. Subsequent T-ALL development occurs 6-8 weeks after transplantation of 50,000 GFP<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells, with GFP<sup>+</sup> pre-leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood 21 days post-transplant reaching 60-70% and consequently 0% survival exceeding 8 weeks (Figure 4C). This protocol has also been successfully employed to generate alternative mouse models of leukemia, such as ÎE-NOTCH1, c-Myc or Flt3-ITD overexpression-induced T-ALL and AML leukemia, with 100% penetrance upon transduction of Lin<sup>-</sup> C57BL/6-derived bone marrow cells and subsequent transplantation of 50, 000 transduced cells with 100% penetrance by 12 weeks (previously published data), illustrating itâs efficacy across multiple lineage-specific oncogenes.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti33199">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Staining Medium (SM)<br/>PBS<br/>2% FBS<br/>1 mM Hepes<br/>0.5 ÂµM EDTA</li><li>293T growth/transfection medium<br/>DMEM<br/>10% FBS<br/>100 U/ml penicillin G<br/>100 Âµg/ml streptomycin</li><li>Growth-factor supplemented CD117<sup>+</sup> cell culture/transduction medium<br/>Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium, GlutaMAX Supplement<br/>10% FBS<br/>100 U/ml penicillin<br/>100 Âµg/ml streptomycin<br/>55 ÂµM 2-mercaptoethanol (Î²-mercaptoethanol)<br/>10 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-3<br/>10 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-6<br/>25 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-7<br/>50 ng/ml recombinant mouse Flt3-L<br/>50 ng/ml recombinant mouse SCF<br/>25 ng/ml recombinant mouse TPO</li><li>Ketamine/xylazine anesthesia cocktail (1 ml)<br/>150 Âµl Ketamine (100 mg/ml)<br/>150 Âµl Xylazine (20 mg/ml)<br/>700 Âµl PBS<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti33200">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This work was supported by the National Institute of Health grants R35 CA210065 (AF) and R01 CA155743 (AF).
