            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Developing protocols to obtain intestinal epithelial monolayers that recapitulate <em>in vivo</em> physiology to overcome the limitations of the organoidsâ closed geometry has become of great interest during the last few years. Most of the developed culture models showed physiological-relevant cell composition but did not prove self-renewing capacities. Here, we show a simple method to obtain mouse small intestine-derived epithelial monolayers organized into proliferative crypt-like domains, containing stem cells, and differentiated villus-like regions, closely resembling the <em>in vivo</em> cell composition and distribution. In addition, we adapted our model to a tissue culture format compatible with functional studies and prove close to physiological barrier properties of our <em>in vitro</em> epithelial monolayers. Thus, we have set-up a protocol to generate physiologically relevant intestinal epithelial monolayers to be employed in assays where independent access to both luminal and basolateral compartments is needed, such as drug absorption, intracellular trafficking and microbiome-epithelium interaction assays.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The development of epithelial organoid culture systems is a major scientific achievement that has been established as an important tool in many basic biology and clinical applications due to their similarity in cell composition and function to the <em>in vivo</em> organ. Specifically, intestinal epithelial organoids are spherical formations with budding structures containing stem, Paneth and proliferative cells, corresponding to intestinal crypts, and inter-budding areas of differentiated cells representing the intestinal villi (Sato <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Ootani <em>et al.</em>, 2009). One of the major drawbacks of the intestinal organoid system is their closed-spherical structure which hampers their use in standard functional assays in which direct access to the organoid lumen or apical site of the epithelium is required. In the last few years, several attempts to open-up the spherical organoids into 2D monolayers have been established (Moon <em>et al.</em>, 2014; VanDussen <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Ettayebi <em>et al.</em>, 2016; In <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Kozuka <em>et al.</em>, 2017). However, the reported epithelial monolayers were mainly composed of mature epithelial cells with poor characterization of the proliferation and self-renewing capacities. More recently, methods to obtain monolayers with both proliferative and differentiated regions have been published. Although showing a physiologically relevant cell composition and distribution, those monolayers did not expand enough to cover the full substrate area and did not allow access to the basolateral site preventing their use in functional assays (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2017a; Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Thorne <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/> <br/>Here, we describe an experimental protocol in which we grow either <em>Lgr5-EGFP-ires-Cre ERT2</em> mouse organoid-derived crypts or single cells on a thin layer of Matrigel to obtain intestinal epithelial monolayers that self-organize in crypt foci, containing stem cells, Paneth and proliferative cells, and villi-like regions composed of differentiated cells, resembling the cell distribution found in the <em>in vivo</em> small intestine. Importantly, our results indicate that the capacity of the intestinal epithelial cells to first self-organize into crypt-like domains and then originate villus-like regions is regulated intrinsically and is not due to the preservation of pre-established crypt configuration. We successfully adapted this method to a Transwell inserts culture format, as previously described (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2017b), which allow an independent access to the basolateral and apical compartments, and demonstrate that the basolateral administration of crypt medium supplemented with non-epithelial niche-derived biochemical factors boosted epithelial monolayer expansion to fully cover the tissue culture substrate without altering the crypt-villus-like cell distribution.<br/> <br/>These features of our model enable to perform functional assays such as to record transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements to determine the monolayersâ epithelial barrier properties. We found that TEER values were within the expected physiological range (40-100 Î© cm<sup>2</sup>) for mouse small intestine, demonstrating an adequate maturation of <em>de novo</em> generated epithelium. Overall, we have developed a protocol to generate organoid-derived intestinal epithelial monolayers with <em>in vivo</em>-like structural and functional features in a culture format compatible with functional assays. We believe our technology meet the necessary features of the complex 3D organotypic cell culture systems and 2D formats for a close to physiological high-throughput testing.</p>

Picture showing the appearance (size and shape) of the tissue pieces obtained after cutting the intestine using surgical scissors.</strong><br/><br/></li><li>Transfer the pieces into a sterile 50 ml Falcon tube under the laminar flow hood.</li><li>Add 10 ml ice-cold PBS and pipette up and down 5-6 times using a 10 ml pipette. Let the pieces settle and discard the supernatant.<br/><em>Note: It is very important that the PBS is ice cold and that the inner pipettes walls are previously wetted with PBS. If not, the tissue pieces might stick to the pipette.</em> </li><li>Add fresh 10 ml ice-cold PBS and repeat the Step A9 for 10-20 times until the supernatant becomes almost clear.<br/><em>Note: The supernatant might still be a bit cloudy after 20 washes, proceed with the next step anyways.</em> </li><li>Add 25 ml of 2 mM EDTA prepared in cold PBS and incubate it for 30 min at 4 Â°C. Agitate vigorously the Falcon tube during incubation on a platform shaker.</li><li>After the incubation, let the tissue pieces settle to the bottom of the Falcon tube and discard the supernatant.</li><li>Add 10 ml of ice-cold PBS with 10% FBS to the tissue pieces using 10 ml pipette. It is recommended to wet the inner wall of the pipette with ice cold-PBS with 10% FBS to avoid tissue pieces sticking to the pipette.</li><li>Pipette up and down 3-5 times the tissue pieces using a 10 ml pipette. Let the pieces to settle down and filter the supernatant through a 70 Âµm pore cell strainer placed on top of a new 50 ml Falcon tube. The eluted solution will correspond to the first crypt elution fraction.</li><li>Repeat the Steps A13 and A14 for 4-5 times more to obtain the following crypt elution fractions. Use new 70 Âµm pore cell strainers and new 50 ml Falcon tubes to collect the subsequent crypt elution fractions.</li><li>Pipette 5 Âµl of each of the eluted fractions in a Petri dish and analyze them using a bright field microscope, to determine the purity and the size of the crypts in each fraction.<br/><em>Note: Usually, the first fractions contain a lot of debris and some villi pieces. It is advisable to discard these fractions and keep the rest, which mainly contain small crypt pieces (Figure 3).</em> </li><li>Pool the selected fractions in a 50 ml Falcon tube and centrifuge the suspension at 55 <em>x g</em> for 5 min at 8 Â°C.<br/><em>Note: In the case reported in Figure 3, we would discard fraction 1 and pool fractions 2, 3 and 4.</em> </li><li>Resuspend the pellet containing the crypts in pre-thawed Matrigel by gently pipetting 2-3 times using a P1000 micropipette and cold 1,000 Âµl pipette tips. The resuspension volume will depend on the number of eluted fractions pooled and therefore the size of the obtained pellet. For example, in the case reported in Figure 3, in which we have polled fractions 2, 3 and 4 (Figure 3A) and obtained the pellet of cells shown in Figure 3B we would use 500 Âµl of Matrigel to resuspend the pellet.<br/><em>Note: Thaw an aliquot (1 ml) of Matrigel on ice at least 1 h before using it. At this step of the protocol you must work always on ice to prevent Matrigel from solidifying.</em> </li><li>Pipette carefully a bubble-free 40 Âµl drop of crypt-Matrigel suspension per well in a pre-warmed 24-well plate. Usually you will obtain around 15 drops. Place the plate into a 37 Â°C incubator for 5-10 min to let the Matrigel solidify.<br/><em>Note: Place the 24-well plate into the incubator at 37 Â°C for 10 min prior to seeding. This helps the drops to form properly.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200119/20200119194403_2607.jpg" width="164"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.

Change the whole medium every 2-3 days. Alternatively, add 100 Âµl fresh medium every other day until passing of the organoids.<br/><em>Note: Typically, crypts will start budding after 2-3 days in culture (Figure 4).
