            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Olfaction is the first sensory modality to develop during fetal life in mammals, and plays a key role in the various behaviors of neonates such as feeding and social interaction. Odorant cues (<em>i.e.</em>, mother or predator scents) can trigger potentiation or inhibition of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) emitted by pups following their isolation. Here, we report how USV are inhibited by olfactory cues using a sono-olfactometer that has been designed to quantify precisely olfaction in pups congenitally infected by cytomegalovirus. This olfactory-driven behavioral test assesses the USV emitted in presence of unfamiliar odorants such as citral scent or adult male mouse scent. We measure the number of USV emitted as an index of odorant detection during the three periods of the 5-min isolation time of the pup into the sono-olfactometer: first period without any odorant, second period with odorant exposure and last period with exhaust odorant. This protocol can be easily used to reveal olfactory deficits in pups with altered olfactory system due to toxic lesions or infectious diseases.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>In mammals, olfaction is the first sensory sense to become functional <em>in utero</em>, long before audition and vision (Stickrod <em>et al.</em>, 1982; Sarnat and Yu, 2016). Survival and growth of neonates depend on the mother and rely heavily on their reciprocal olfactory-driven behaviors such as nipple localization, feeding, attachment, predator avoidance, <em>etc</em>. (Teicher and Blass, 1976; Brunjes and Alberts, 1979; Bell and Smotherman, 1980; Brouette-Lahlou <em>et al.</em>, 1992; Shair <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Hongo <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Perry <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Al AÃ¯n <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Thus, congenital or perinatal impairment of the sense of smell, such as toxic or infectious injury of the olfactory system, could have profound health concerns. While a great number of non-operant and operant behavioral tests are available for assessing the sense of smell in adult rodents (Bodyak and Slotnick, 1989; Slotnick and Restrepo, 2005; Kobayakawa <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Yang and Crawley, 2009), there is a serious limitation in exploring olfaction in very young rodents due to their limited behavioral repertoire. Nevertheless, a suitable test to address odor perception in rodent pups has been designed based on the recording of ultrasonic isolation calls (Hofer and Shair, 1991; Hofer <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Lemasson <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Lazarini <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Young pups, while isolated from the mother and littermates and placed in low ambient temperature produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) at a high rate (Smith and Sales, 1980; Branchi <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Castellucci <em>et al.</em>, 2018), that promote maternal behavior such as searching for pups, retrieving and licking of pups (Noirot, 1974; Brounette-Lahlou <em>et al.</em>, 1992; Brunelli <em>et al.</em>, 1994). Infants of most mammals, including humans, also emit repeated vocalizations in the audible range after isolation, as a distress signal aiming at eliciting maternal behavior. USV emission of the isolated rodent pups stops at the contact of the mother, littermates or nest odor (SzentgyÃ¶rgyi <em>et al.</em>, 2008). On the one hand, potentiation of the USV response to isolation can be induced by exposition to the scent of its mother or another lactating female (Shair <em>et al.</em>, 1999). On the other hand, inhibition of the ultrasonic calls could be induced by exposition to the scent of an unfamiliar adult male, one of its common predators in the wild (Shair <em>et al.</em>, 1999). USV inhibition can also be achieved by exposure to a non-social odorant cue, such as citral, that triggers innate aversive response (Lemasson <em>et al.</em>, 2005). Using this olfactory-induced USV inhibition, we found that congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection alters olfaction as early as Day 6 after birth, long before hearing deterioration in mice (Lazarini <em>et al.</em>, 2018). <br/><br/>The current protocol describes a method for assessing odor perception in young mouse pups soon after birth, using a custom-made sono-olfactometer. Because this approach has been developed in the context of congenital viral infection, the sono-olfactometer was designed to prevent any spread of the virus from infected pups to the environment. It can be used therefore in Biosafety level 1 (BSL-1), level 2 (BSL-2) or level 3 (BSL-3) according to the microbial status of the manipulated animals. This characteristic was made possible by slightly modifying the earlier version of our olfactometers (Lemasson <em>et al.</em>, 2005). The pup chamber of the sono-olfactometer constitutes a mini-isolator in which odorants can be presented at a constant concentration and then efficiently exhausted. This sono-olfactometer allows simultaneous exposition to various odorants and recordings of USV emitted by the pup placed in the chamber. This protocol can be easily expanded to explore olfaction in other paradigms of acute and chronic injury or infectious diseases in the olfactory system of wild-type or genetically-modified rodents.</p>

The isolated chamber.</strong> The isolated chamber (inside size 18 x 12 x 12 cm) is sealed and airtight when closed. The isolated chamber was made with components (8 mm-thick black PVC walls for the ceiling, the floor and sides, 8 mm-thick transparent plexiglass for the door, 5 mm-diameter rubber seal for the door, 0.1 mm-thick aluminum coating plate with 2 mm diameter holes) easily available in DIY stores such as Lacrylic shop, Bonneuil sur Marne, France. The odor port and the ultrasonic microphone are on the right side of the chamber. The odor dispenser releases the Odor/Air mixture in a controlled manner through the odor port (Figure 3). A drain hole in the center of the left side is connected to a HEPA exhaust air filter (Millex-FG, 0.20 Âµm, PTFE hydrophobe, 50 mm). The air is evacuated by an exhaust air pump, a non-return (check) valve (composed of two elements from Colder Products, and an exhaust air flow meter (Figure 3), thus avoiding microbial contamination of the environment. The exhaust air containing odorants is directly diverted to the air exhaust of the animal facility. The HEPA exhaust air filter is changed at the end of the experiment, after the testing of all the pups. The ultrasonic microphone is offset inside the box.<br/><br/></li><li>The odor dispenser (olfactometer) (Figure 3):<br/><ol class="npwfour"><li>Emitting air pump (Schego, catalog number: M2K3)</li><li>Air flow meter (Key Instrument, catalog number: FR2A14BVBN)</li><li>Odor flow meter (Brooks Instrument, catalog number: FR2A13BVBN)</li><li>Odor valves (<em>e.g.</em>, ASCO, catalog number: SCH284A005.12/DC or Bio-Chem Fluidics, catalog number: 100P2NC12-05B or equivalent normally closed solenoid pinch valves)</li><li>Exhaust air pump (Schego, catalog number: 850)</li><li>C-Flex<sup>Â®</sup> Standard Tubing (ID: 0.125 OD: 0.250)<br/><em>Note: The tubing is GMP Compliant.</em> </li></ol></li></ol></li><em>Note: All electronics used to control the system is a custom-made device but it could easily be replaced by a commercialized version of Arduino card: <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products" target="_blank">https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products</a>.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="111" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190217/20190217175003_5922.jpg" width="180"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.
