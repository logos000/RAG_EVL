            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Myofiber isolation followed with <em>ex vivo</em> culture could recapitulate and visualize satellite cells (SCs) activation, proliferation, and differentiation. This approach could be taken to understand the physiology of satellite cells and the molecular mechanism of regulatory factors, in terms of the involvement of intrinsic factors over SCs quiescence, activation, proliferation and differentiation. Single myofiber culture has several advantages that the traditional approach such as FASC and cryosection could not compete with. For example, myofiber isolation and culture could be used to observe SCs activation, proliferation and differentiation at a continuous manner within their physiological ânicheâ environment while FACS or cryosection could only capture single time-point upon external stimulation to activate satellite cells by BaCl<sub>2</sub>, Cardiotoxin or ischemia. Furthermore, <em>in vitro</em> transfection with siRNA or overexpression vector could be performed under <em>ex vivo</em> culture to understand the detailed molecular function of a specific gene on SCs physiology. With these advantages, the physiological state of SCs could be analyzed at multiple designated time-points by immunofluorescence staining. In this protocol, we provide an efficient and practical protocol to isolate single myofiber from EDL muscle, followed with <em>ex vivo</em> culture and immunostaining.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Satellite cells are considered as an adult stem cell because they maintain self-renew and remarkable postnatal regenerative potential of skeletal muscle (Collins <em>et al.</em>, 2005). SCs are located between the basal lamina and the plasma lemma of myofibers (MAURO, 1961). Here, to isolate the single myofiber, EDL muscle is digested with the collagenase to release the connective tissue and completely dissociate the connective tissue between fibers. In 1986, it was reported that the proliferation of satellite cells on single muscle fibers were isolated from adult rats and were cultured in cell culture plate (Bischoff, 1986). It was further developed into a tissue culture system that reliably permits isolation of intact, living, single muscle fibers with associated satellite cells from predominantly fast- and slow-twitch muscles of rat or mouse (Bekoff and Betz, 1977a and 1977b; Rosenblatt <em>et al.</em>, 1995). There are two main approaches to study SCs: single myofiber culture and primary myoblast culture prepared from mononucleated cells dissociated from whole muscle (Danoviz and Yablonka-Reuveni, 2012). Even though, primary myoblast could be split and passaged multiple times, these primary myoblasts retain in proliferation or differentiation states. Freshly isolated single myofiber allows satellite cells to stay beneath the basal lamina at quiescent state, followed with activation by either internal environment or external factors. There are several improvements for myofiber isolation and culture in recent years (Danoviz and Yablonka-Reuveni, 2012; Pasut <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Gallot <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Lim <em>et al.</em>, 2018). However, the difficulty of myofiber isolation and <em>ex vivo</em> culture prevent further application of this reliable and practical method. In the current protocol, we optimized reagents used for single myofiber isolation and improved procedures to make it even more simple and easy to repeat from hand to hand. Since satellite cells are sensitive to various factors, we describe a relatively simple, detailed and efficient approach to isolate and culture single myofiber. Based on our protocol, state and function of satellite cells could be analyzed from mice with different genotypes. Different manipulation such as transfection, and drug treatment on myofibers, followed with the downstream procedures including but not limited to myofiber transplantation and immunostaining could be performed. These additional manipulations could not be performed in these approaches such as FASC or cryosection.</p>
