            <h1>Delayed Alternation Task for the Study of Spatial Working and Long Term Memory in Rats</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Megi Hoxha, Marta  Sabariego</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Memory systems can hold previously presented information for several seconds, bridging gaps between discontinuous events. It has been previously demonstrated that the hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) are necessary for memory retention over delay intervals in alternation tasks. Here we describe the delayed alternation task, a spatial working memory (WM) task in which animals need to alternate between left and right sides of a figure-8 maze on a trial-by-trial basis to receive a reward. On each trial of this task, the rat has to remember the last episode and turn in the opposite direction compared to the previous trial. We manipulated the WM load by introducing delays of various lengths (10 s and 60 s) between trials. While other alternation task protocols use short delay intervals between trials, our protocol introduces a longer delay condition that requires animals to use long-term memory resources that are not necessarily supported by sequential neuronal firing patterns (<em>i.e.</em>, time cells) as are seen with shorter delay intervals.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>A main function of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex is to connect events separated by delay intervals (Eichenbaum, 2017; Robinson <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Ainge <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Sabariego <em>et al.</em>, 2019). It has been proposed that retention of memory for these events is accomplished by cells that fire at successive moments in temporally structured experiences, known as time cells (Eichenbaum, 2017). However, while most studies have used alternation task protocols with short delay intervals that did not exceed 15 s (Ainge <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Ito <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Pastalkova <em>et al.</em>, 2008), recent data suggest that time cell firing begins to disappear after approximately the first 20 s of the delay interval (Sabariego <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Therefore, it is important to explore both behavioral performance and neuronal firing during delays that exceed these shorter time intervals. Consequently, the delayed alternation task protocol described here uses longer delays of 60 s, which require animals to use long term memory resources, likely due to a WM overload (Kim <em>et al.</em>, 2013). This protocol represents a valuable tool for exploring the discrete serial firing patterns observed during shorter delay periods and the mechanisms involved in supporting WM and long-term memory maintenance sustained by other mechanisms, like local synaptic plasticity in hippocampus, sharp-wave ripples, or by activity patterns elsewhere in the brain. Moreover, and because it also includes a shorter delay condition (10 s delay), where sequential firing occurs, it provides an opportunity for the study of these discrete serial firing patterns observed during shorter delay periods.</p>
