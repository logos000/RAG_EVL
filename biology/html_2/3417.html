            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Controlled differentiation of embryonic stem cells is an essential tool in stem cell research. In this protocol, we describe a simple differentiation protocol involving the induction of embryoid body formation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) using hanging droplets, followed by differentiation into a neuronal lineage.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>One of the major achievements in embryonic stem cell research has been the ability to direct the differentiation of stem cells into specific developmental lineages and ultimately terminally differentiated cells. To preserve pluripotency of mESCs in <em>in vitro</em> culture, cells are grown in the presence of the Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine, which promotes self-renewal and inhibits differentiation. A common method to direct stem cell differentiation into all three germ layer lineages is to remove LIF from the culture medium and forcing the formation of complex three-dimensional cell aggregates termed embryoid bodies (EBs) (Itskovitz-Eldor <em>et al.</em>, 2000). Differentiation in these embryoid bodies is considered to be disorganized, however mESC culture in the absence of LIF and in the presence of certain stimuli can result in more specific cell types, including insulin-producing cells, hematopoietic cells and neuronal cells. Differentiation of ESCs into neural lineage involves the manipulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor and Wnt signaling in the absence of Bone morphogenetic protein signaling activity (Abranches <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Common methods involve co-culture of ESCs on stromal feeder cells or conditioned medium or direct manipulation of the essential signaling pathways which can be quite involved and time-consuming. A more straightforward method is by incubating ESCs with the natural metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid which acts on nuclear receptors to induce transcription of specific target genes. Retinoic acid has been shown to play a directing role in neural development in early stages of central nervous system development and is considered the most important extrinsic inductive signals for neural differentiation. In this protocol, we describe an efficient method to produce mouse-derived EBs and consequent neuronal differentiation using hanging droplets and retinoic acid (Jones-Villeneuve <em>et al.</em>, 1983; Wobus <em>et al.</em>, 1991). </p>
