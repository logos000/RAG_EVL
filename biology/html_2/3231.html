Unfortunately, at the time we were submitting the article for publication a mistake was made in regards to Maria Auxiliadora-Martinsâ affiliation. Also, as Mariaâs research was supported by FAPESP, I would like to amend an acknowledgement referring this grant as well. I kindly ask that an amendment is included as follows:<br/><br/>The correct affiliation for Maria Auxiliadora-Martins <strong>is FundaÃ§Ã£o de Apoio ao Ensino, Pesquisa e AssistÃªncia do Hospital das ClÃ­nicas da Faculdade de Medicina de RibeirÃ£o Preto da Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (FAEPA), SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil</strong>. <br/><br/>The updated acknowledgement is: This work was supported in part by grants from the Ted Nash Long Life Foundation, the Glenn Foundation for Medical Research via the Paul F. Glenn Laboratories for the Biology of Aging at the Mayo Clinic, a grant from Calico Laboratories, the Mayo Foundation, National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants from the National Institute of Aging (NIA, grant AG-26094), the Pancreatic Cancer SPORE project from NIH/NCI to E.N.C (grant CA102701-08), the Mayo Clinic Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology (NIDDK P30DK084567). <strong>Maria Auxiliadora-Martins was supported by a grant from FundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo (FAPESP) Brazil (#2016/20089-4)</strong>.<p class="pptt">### References</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>de Oliveira, G.
