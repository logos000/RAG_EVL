            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Lipid mixing (redistribution of lipid probes between fusing membranes) has been widely used to study early stages of relatively fast viral and intracellular fusion processes that take seconds to minutes. Lipid mixing assays are especially important for identification of hemifusion intermediates operationally defined as lipid mixing without content mixing. Due to unsynchronized character and the slow rate of the differentiation processes that prime the cells for cell-cell fusion processes in myogenesis, osteoclastogenesis and placentogenesis, these fusions take days. Application of lipid mixing assays to detect early fusion intermediates in these very slow fusion processes must consider the continuous turnover of plasma membrane components and potential fusion-unrelated exchange of the lipid probes between the membranes. Here we describe the application of lipid mixing assay in our work on myoblast fusion stage in development and regeneration of skeletal muscle cells. Our approach utilizes conventional <em>in vitro</em> model of myogenic differentiation and fusion based on murine C2C12 cells. When we observe the appearance of first multinucleated cells, we lift the cells and label them with either fluorescent lipid DiI as a membrane probe or CellTracker<sup>TM</sup> Green as a content probe. Redistribution of the probes between the cells is scored by fluorescence microscopy. Hemifused cells are identified as mononucleated cells labeled with both content- and membrane probes. The interpretation must be supported by a system of negative controls with fusion-incompetent cells to account for and minimize contributions of fusion-unrelated exchange of the lipid probes. This approach with minor modifications has been used for investigating fusion of primary murine myoblasts, osteoclast precursors and fusion mediated by a gamete fusogen HAP2, and likely can be adopted for other slow cell-cell fusion processes.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Fusion of membrane lipid bilayers in cell biological processes as diverse as fusion of intracellular membranes in exocytosis, and fusion of viral and cell membranes in enveloped virus infection, and myoblast fusion in skeletal muscle development apparently involves similar lipid rearrangements (Figure 1) (Brukman <em>et al.</em>, 2019). First, a merger of the apposing, contacting monolayers of two fusing bilayers generates a hemifusion connection and allows redistribution of lipid probes between these monolayers. A subsequent merger of the distal monolayers generates a fusion pore and allows redistribution of aqueous probes between fusing membrane compartments.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200301/20200301173643_8458.jpg" width="255"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Schematic representation of the lipid rearrangements during hemifusion and fusion pore formation</strong> (modified from Figure 1 in Brukman <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>Hemifusion can either transition into a fusion pore or represent a dead end of the fusion reaction aborted before fusion pore formation. In the latter case, hemifusion connections can then dissociate yielding two distinct bilayers. In their turn, nascent fusion pores can either close or expand advancing fusion towards its completion with full unification of the membrane compartments. The rates of formation and dissociation of the key fusion intermediates, hemifusion and fusion pores, and the rates of the transition between these intermediates vary between different fusion processes and are determined by the activity of the proteins involved and lipid compositions of the fusing membranes.<br/> <br/>In most of the experimental studies, pores large enough to pass content probes in the range from ~1 kDa to ~100 kDa are detected by fluorescence microscopy. Hemifusion, operationally defined as lipid mixing without content mixing, is detected using fluorescence microscopy or spectrofluorometry. Different modifications of lipid mixing assays have been developed in studies on fusion of protein-free lipid bilayers, and fusion mediated by viral fusogens and intracellular fusogens (Brukman <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The successful application of the lipid mixing assay in all these systems has been facilitated by a relative rapidness of these fusion processes with characteristic times of lipid mixing varying from seconds to minutes.<br/> <br/>Application of lipid mixing assays to developmental cell-cell fusion, the subject of this work, is critically important for clarification of the pathways of the membrane rearrangements but more challenging than for faster viral and intracellular fusion reactions. For instance, formation of multinucleated myotubes, one of the best characterized examples of cell-cell fusion processes (Sampath <em>et al.</em>, 2018), is preceded by myogenic differentiation that prepares the cells for fusion and takes days. As a result, by the time fusion is evaluated, fluorescent lipid probes added before fusion to label plasma membranes are already partially internalized. Moreover, labeling of intracellular membrane compartments containing internalized probes may appear brighter than labeling of the plasma membrane because of a higher membrane content and contrast. An additional concern in developing lipid mixing assays for very slow fusion processes is related to the ability of lipid probes to be transferred from membrane to membrane by lipid-exchanging proteins, lipid micelles or extracellular vesicles (reviewed in Merklinger <em>et al.</em>, 2016), <em>i.e.</em>, by mechanisms that neither involve hemifusion or fusion nor depend on the fusion machinery.<br/> <br/>Here we present a protocol used to assay lipid mixing in fusion between C2C12 cells, immortalized mouse myoblasts that proliferate in high-serum medium and differentiate and fuse in low-serum medium. We also discuss applications of the modified versions of this protocol to other slow cell-cell fusion processes.</p>

First, we find the median of maximal DiI fluorescence levels F<sub>max</sub> in ~100 DiI-labeled cells that have no green fluorescence. We use this value to set the lower limit of fluorescence for detection of DiI redistribution using the following formula:<br/><br/><em>F</em><sub><em>mi</em><em>n</em></sub><em>=background+k(F</em><sub><em>max</em></sub><em>-background)</em><br/><br/>We found that k = 0.1 works well to exclude cells that acquired DiI fluorescence by fusion-unrelated mechanisms. To count the co-labeled cells, we adjust image contrast by setting in Brightness/Contrast tool minimum to F<sub>min</sub> and select the maximum to reveal the faintest distinct puncta. After that, we count as co-labeled all green cells that have at least 3 distinct perinuclearly located DiI puncta. (1-2 bright red puncta that we occasionally find associated with cell-surface likely represent debris or extracellular vesicles and the corresponding cells are not scored as co-labeled.)</li><li>To quantify the efficiency of hemifusion for different conditions we normalize the number of mononucleated double-labeled cells in the field of view by the total number of mononucleated cells in the field. For each condition, we score at least 10 randomly selected fields of view. The characteristic results for Myomerger-deficient cells, Myomaker-deficient cells and wild type (WT) cells are shown in Figure 6.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200302/20200302174321_2138.jpg" width="132"/><br/><strong>Figure 6.

Hemifusion efficiency, <em>i.e.</em>, the probability that under given conditions the cells will hemifuse but will not proceed to fusion completion is quantified by normalizing the numbers of hemifusion events in the field of view (mononucleated double-labeled cells to the total number of nuclei in this field). Assuming that each complete fusion event proceeds through hemifusion intermediates, the efficiency of local membrane merger events yielding either hemi- or complete fusion can be quantified as (N<sub>hf</sub> + N<sub>cf</sub>)/N<sub>t</sub>, where Nhf is the number of hemifusion events, N<sub>cf</sub>, the number of complete fusion events (estimated as the number of nuclei in the cells with at least 2 nuclei) and N<sub>t</sub>, the total number of the nuclei in this field.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32043">### Notes</p><p class="ppzz"><strong><em>Modifications of the assay for different cell-cell fusion processes</em></strong> </p><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Lipid mixing assay has been successfully adapted for fusion of primary murine myoblasts (Gamage <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Leikina <em>et al.</em>, 2013 and 2018), HAP2-mediated fusion of BHK cells (Valansi <em>et al.</em>, 2017) and osteoclast precursors (Verma <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The required modifications mostly reflected the differences in characteristic rates of the cell fusion processes necessitating adjustment of the relative timing of labeling stages. For instance, primary murine myoblasts that differentiate and fuse faster than C2C12 cells, were labeled in PM rather than in DM (Leikina <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Then differently labeled cells were co-plated in DM to start myogenic differentiation and fusion.</li><li>In Valansi <em>et al.</em>, 2017 and Leikina <em>et al.</em>, 2018, we used a modification of the lipid mixing assay, in which we co-plated cells labeled with both lipid and content probe with unlabeled cells, instead of co-plating cells labeled with membrane probe and cells labeled with content probe. In this experimental design, cell fusion stalled at the hemifusion stage produces cells labeled with membrane, but not content probe. Application of this assay requires control experiments with cells labeled with both membrane and content probes cultured in the absence of unlabeled cells to verify that cells labeled with only membrane probe are generated by interactions between labeled and unlabeled cells but not by content probe leakage.</li></ol><br/><strong><em>Concerns and controls</em></strong> <ol class="npwtwo"><li>An important concern in developing lipid mixing assays for very slow fusion processes is related to the ability of lipid probes to be transferred from membrane to membrane by lipid-exchanging proteins, lipid micelles or extracellular vesicles (reviewed in Merklinger <em>et al.</em>, 2016), <em>i.e.</em>, by mechanisms that do not depend on the cell fusion machinery. DiI, lipid probe used in our assay, has been developed for long-term labeling and, after careful optimization, DiI and similar lipid probes have been used for tracking individual cells in tissues for several days and even weeks (reviewed in Progatzky <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Still, application of DiI-based lipid mixing assay for slow fusion processes requires a set of controls to assure that redistribution of lipid probes is due to membrane merger rather than to the fusion-independent transfer of the probes. If, under some conditions, fusion-independent redistribution of lipid probes dominates fusion-dependent redistribution, the conditions should be altered to reduce fusion-unrelated components of the lipid probe transfer between the membranes. To optimize the experimental procedure, we use cells lacking functional fusion machinery (proliferating satellite cells, differentiating myomaker-deficient myoblasts in DM and differentiating myoblasts in the presence of hemifusion inhibitor lysophosphatidylcholine [Leikina <em>et al.</em>, 2013]). The main factors contributing to the fusion-independent lipid mixing are the details of cell labeling protocol (probe concentration and incubation time), number of washes, cell viability (to minimize cell debris), and fusion efficiency of the cells (to increase the relative contribution of the membrane-merger-dependent lipid mixing). In addition, too high confluency of cell monolayer can lead to undetected overlaps between green cells and red cells in fluorescence microscopy images.</li><li>Myomaker-deficient C2C12 cells and Myomerger-deficient C2C12 cells provide convenient controls for the lipid mixing assay. As seen in Figure 6, Myomerger-deficient cells demonstrate much higher levels of lipid mixing than Myomaker-deficient cells. Importantly, we show that lipid probe transfer for Myomerger-deficient cells depends on the contacts between differently labeled cells rather than on the transfer through the medium (for instance, by extracellular vesicles), by incubating unlabeled differentiating cells in the conditioned medium from DiI- labeled differentiating cells (Figure 7).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200302/20200302174355_4007.jpg" width="133"/><br/><strong>Figure 7. Representative fluorescence microscopy image that illustrates cell-cell fusion independent acquisition of Dil by unlabeled cells incubated with conditioned medium from Dil-labeled cells.</strong> The conditioned medium from Myomerger-deficient cells committed to differentiation and labeled with Dil as described above was collected at t = 72 h post differentiation. In another dish, unlabeled differentiating Myomerger-deficient cells were placed into this conditioned medium at t = 24 h. At t = 72 h, these cells were fixed and analyzed. Scale bar = 50 Î¼m.<br/><br/>As expected, in these experiments we find only few cells that acquired lipid probe and no cells containing more than 3 distinct perinuclearly located DiI puncta. In this experimental design, finding significant numbers of DiI-labeled cells would suggest problems with DiI labeling.<br/><br/></li><li>Identification of hemifusion phenotype in lipid mixing assay can be further validated by independent experimental approaches that do not utilize lipid mixing assays. These two approaches (short-term application of hypotonic shock or chlorpromazine) reveal hemifusion intermediates by converting them into easy-to-detect complete fusion (Melikyan <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Chernomordik <em>et al.</em>, 1998). Hypotonic osmotic shock generates membrane tension that breaks hemifusion structures, and chlorpromazine preferentially partitions to inner monolayers of plasma membranes and destabilizes hemifusion intermediate formed by these monolayers. Neither of the treatments induces complete fusion if applied to tightly bound rather than hemifused cells.</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32044">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">The research in L.V.C.âs laboratory was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, and by Grant Number 2013151 from the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF).
