    <h1><em>Ex vivo Drosophila</em> Wing Imaginal Disc Culture and Furin Inhibitor Assay</h1>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Alex Sohr, Lijuan Du, Sougata Roy</p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Furin is an evolutionarily conserved proprotein convertase (PC) family enzyme with a broad range of substrates
        that are essential for developmental, homeostatic, and disease pathways. Classical genetic approaches and <em>in
            vitro</em> biochemical or cell biological assays identified that precursor forms of most growth factor
        family proteins are processed by Furin. To quantitatively assess the potential role of Furin in cleaving and
        modulating intercellular dispersion of a <em>Drosophila</em> signaling protein, we developed a simple assay by
        combining genetics, <em>ex vivo</em> organ culture, pharmacological treatment, and imaging analyses. The
        protocol herein describes how to <em>ex vivo</em> culture <em>Drosophila</em> wing imaginal discs expressing a
        fluorescently tagged <em>Drosophila</em> Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF, Branchless/Bnl) over a long period of
        time in the presence of Furin inhibitors and monitor the cleavage and intercellular dispersion of the truncated
        Bnl parts using microscopy. Although the assay described here is for assessing the effect of Furin inhibition on
        Bnl cleavage in the <em>Drosophila</em> larval wing imaginal disc, the principle and methodology can easily be
        adopted for any other signals, tissue systems, or organisms. This strategy and protocol provide an assay for
        examining Furin activity on a specific substrate by directly visualizing the spatiotemporal distribution of its
        truncated parts in an <em>ex vivo</em>-cultured organ.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The range of intercellular dispersion and signaling activity of many morphogenetic signaling proteins depends on
        'limited proteolysis' by proprotein convertases (PCs) (LeMosy, 2006; KÃ¼nnapuu <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Wharton
        and Serpe, 2013; Sohr <em>et al.</em>, 2019). PCs are serine endoprotease family enzymes that are known to
        cleave various growth factors including Epidermal growth factor (EGF), the Transforming Growth Factor beta/Bone
        Morphogenetic Protein (TGF-Î²/BMP) family, several Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family proteins,
        Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), all of which play a
        critical role in development and diseases (Khatib and Geraldine, 2006; Tulin and Stathopoulos, 2010; Rousselet
        <em>et al.</em>, 2011; KÃ¼nnapuu <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Constam, 2014; Anderson and Wharton, 2017; Sohr <em>et
            al.</em>, 2019). Although biochemical and cell culture assays are sufficient to demonstrate a substrate
        cleavage by individual PC substrate-specificity, their functional characterization in vivo is largely dependent
        on classical genetic approaches. However, the presence of multiple PCs in different organisms and their
        functional redundancy can only provide limited information about an individual PC's function. There are nine PCs
        in vertebrates and three in <em>Drosophila</em>, all expressed broadly, that share a consensus cleavage site
        (-Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg-) in their substrates. Moreover, a broad range of cellular substrates as well as
        extracellular matrix proteins that can also influence a signaling or morphogenetic outcome makes the genetic
        results hard to interpret.<br /> <br />Here we present a protocol that enables direct visualization of
        Furin-dependent signal cleavage by monitoring the spatiotemporal fates of the cleaved portions of a substrate in
        developing organs. The strategy and methodology was designed to examine <em>Drosophila</em> Bnl cleavage by
        Furin. The experiment takes advantage of the 3rd instar larval wing imaginal disc and an associated tracheal
        branch called the air sac primordium (ASP) (Sato and Kornberg, 2002). Bnl is expressed by a restricted group of
        wing disc cells and subsequently transported to the ASP to control its morphogenesis (Sato and Kornberg, 2002;
        Du <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Bnl is cleaved by Furin-1 at the 164<sup>th</sup> amino acid residue prior to the
        interorgan transport of only its C-terminal truncated portion that contains the receptor binding site (Sohr
        <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The truncated part of Bnl forms a characteristic long-range gradient in the ASP by
        binding to its receptor and traveling through actin-based filopodia or cytonemes extended by ASP cells (Du
        <em>et al.</em>, 2018). To visually monitor the fates of the full-length Bnl and its truncated portions, we
        first generated a transgenic <em>Drosophila</em> line harboring a chimeric Bnl construct with an HA-tag at the
        87<sup>th</sup> and a GFP tag at 432<sup>nd</sup> residue, flanking the cleavage site and conserved FGF domain.
        The construct was expressed in the wing disc Bnl source. Laval wing discs were dissected and <em>ex
            vivo</em>-cultured in the absence or presence of Furin protease inhibitors for variable amounts of time
        followed by Î±-HA immunostaining and fluorescence microscopic imaging of the discs. While in normal conditions
        only the C-terminal GFP-tagged fragment of Bnl was transported to the ASP, the addition of Furin inhibitors to
        the <em>ex vivo</em> culture resulted in uncleaved Bnl with both tags being transported to the recipient ASP
        cells (Figure 1). Since a broad range of signaling proteins involved in morphogenetic and disease pathways are
        modulated by Furin, the methodology described here can be a powerful tool to evaluate the role of Furin cleavage
        in various other signaling pathways. For instance, despite the wide-spread occurrence of signal cleavage
        modulating paracrine signaling activity, most full-length uncleaved forms of the signals were also found to
        activate receptors and are shown to be secreted when expressed in cultured cells (KÃ¼nnapuu <em>et al.</em>,
        2009; Tulin and Stathopoulos, 2010; Sopory <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Tokhunts <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Constam,
        2014). Therefore, a link between PC-dependent cleavage with the maturation and activity of the proteins remained
        obscure. The results from this assay together with other experiments showed that uncleaved Bnl is active and can
        be transported to the recipient cells to induce signaling. However, Bnl cleavage ensures its efficient polarized
        target-specific dispersion, thereby modulating its range and tissue-specific activity (Sohr <em>et al.</em>,
        2019). The <em>ex vivo</em> culture method with pharmacological Furin inhibition strategy is not limited to only
        the <em>Drosophila</em> wing imaginal disc and ASP tissue system. Similar assays can easily be applied to other
        <em>Drosophila</em> tissues, signaling proteins, or model systems.

    <li>Preparation of late 3<sup>rd</sup> instar <em>Drosophila</em> larvae for dissection<ol class="npwtwo">
            <li>Dip a paint brush into deionized water and use it to remove late 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae that are
                wandering on sides of the fly vial.</li>
            <li>Place ~10 larvae into a spot plate well containing 1x PBS. </li>
            <li>Gently swirl them around with the paint brush to remove any large food debris that may be stuck on the
                surface of the larvae.</li>
            <li>With forceps, gently transfer these larvae to a separate spot plate well containing 70% ethanol. </li>
            <li>Swirl the larvae around gently and ensure that they are submerged. Incubate for 1-2 min to surface
                sterilize them.</li>
            <li>Remove the larvae from ethanol with forceps and place them into a spot plate well containing fresh 1x
                PBS (different well from Step B2). </li>
            <li>Rinse the larvae twice with 1x PBS in a separate spot plate well to completely remove the
                ethanol.<br /><br /></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>3<sup>rd</sup> Instar larva dissection<ol class="npwtwo">
            <li>Remove one washed larva from the group and place in a plastic Petri dish containing WM1 media (see
                Recipes). The larva should be completely submerged in the media.</li>
            <li>Using forceps and the dissection microscope, remove and discard the bottom 1/3 of the posterior portion
                of the larva. The anterior portion will contain all imaginal discs aside from the genital discs (Figure
                2).</li>
            <li>Invert the anterior portion of the larva by using forceps to push the mouth hooks (tip of anterior half)
                through the interior of the larva towards the posterior end, resulting in the imaginal discs and other
                interior tissues being externalized. <br /><em>Note: A video showing the initial larval dissection can

<p class="pptt" id="biaoti28839">### Notes</p>
<ol class="npwtwok">
    <li>We suggest trying only the dissection and culturing steps before doing the full experiment with inhibitors and
        staining to make sure that the culturing portion of the protocol is working. If the majority of the dissected
        larval carcasses turn completely black during the culturing period at any point, the tissues are dying and there
        is likely something wrong with one or multiple aspects of the protocol. This could be due to dissection
        technique, insufficient washing of the larvae before and/or after dissecting, or contaminated
        materials/equipment. Keeping as sterile an environment as possible during this process is critical for the
        success of the experiment, as bacterial infections can occur easily. Many of the bacteria likely originate from
        the dissected gut of the larva, hence the importance of removing the gut and washing the dissected larval
        carcass in fresh WM1 to eliminate as much bacteria as possible. </li>
    <li>The WM1 media volume for culturing should be just sufficient to submerge the larval carcasses. We evaluated wing
        discs expressing Bnl:HA<sub>1</sub>GFP<sub>3</sub> cultured up to 16 h. Inter-organ transfer of the truncated
        Bnl:GFP<sub>3</sub> portion from the wing disc to the growing ASP indicated that normal signaling activity
        persists even after 16 h of <em>ex vivo</em> conditions. However, due to the submerged culture conditions, there
        is an increase in hypoxia-induced changes in the tissue as clearly seen by the appearance of ectopic
        Bnl-expressing cells between 8 and 16 h of culture. </li>
    <li>It is critical that all imaging parameters (<em>i.e.</em>, laser intensity, exposure time, gain, <em>etc.</em>)
        remain the same for each image and group. This ensures that the quantitation of fluorescent intensities is
        comparable between different groups.<br /></li>
