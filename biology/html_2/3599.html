            <h1>A Sensitive Coupled Enzyme Assay for Measuring Kinase and ATPase Kinetics Using ADP-Specific Hexokinase</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ciaran R. McFarlane, James W. Murray</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Kinases and ATPases perform essential biological functions in metabolism and regulation. Activity of these enzymes is commonly measured by coupling ATP consumption to the synthesis of a detectable product. For most assay systems the ATP concentration during the reaction is unknown, compromising the precision of the assay.<br/><br/>Using the ADP-specific hexokinase (ADP-HK) from the thermophilic archaeon <em>Thermococcus litoralis</em> the protocol outlined here allows real time coupling of ATP consumption to downstream signal change enabling accurate kinetic measurements. ADP-HK phosphorylates glucose that is then used by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH which can be measured at 340 nm. We have shown this assay to be sensitive to the detection of micromole quantities of ADP with no detectable background from ATP.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Kinases and ATPases can be measured by coupling the production of ADP to a spectrophotometrically detectable signal. Commercial vendors provide kits that detect the amount of ADP produced or ATP depleted by coupling them to the production of a fluorescent or bioluminescent signal (examples include ATP-Glo; Promega, ADP-sensor; Biovision). These kits are sensitive but are hard to apply to kinetic questions because they are end-point assays, measuring ADP amounts at a single time point. Furthermore, the black box nature of such kits make it difficult to determine if reaction mixtures are in the steady-state conditions required for Michaelis-Menten kinetics.<br/><br/>Continuous assays measure enzyme activity over time allowing the determination of enzyme rate in a single run. The classic continuous coupled-enzyme assay is the pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase system (Kornberg and Pricer, 1951). During the reaction, pyruvate kinase uses the ADP produced by the target enzyme to convert phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and in the process regenerate ATP. Pyruvate is then used by lactate dehydrogenase to oxidize NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> which is measured by the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (Figure 1A). A drawback of this method is that in regenerating the ATP continuously, the ATP concentration at any given point is unknown which means that Michaelis-Menten kinetics for ATP cannot be calculated.<br/><br/>An optimal coupled reaction proceeds in a linear pathway so that the ADP produced is converted stoichiometrically into the component producing the signal. ADP-specific hexokinase (ADP-HK) from <em>Thermococcus litoralis</em> uses ADP to phosphorylate glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, which can be used by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) to reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH (Ito <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Sakuraba and Ohshima, 2002) (Figure 1B). ADP-HK is an ADP-specific enzyme from thermophilic archaea that is adapted to consume ADP instead of ATP, probably because of the higher thermostability of ADP over ATP. ADP-HK has previously been used in conjunction with G6PDH and diaphorase I to measure the abundance of dNDPs from cellular extracts with a colorimetric signal but has yet to be demonstrated in a continuous assay to measure kinetics (Kumagai <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Here, we have used the specificity of ADP-specific hexokinase to develop a method for assaying ADP production by kinases and ATPases.<br/><br/><p class="ppzz" style="margin-left:30px;"><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200423/20200423235203_0709.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Schematic of two coupled enzyme assays to measure ATPase/kinase activity.</strong> A. The traditional method for measuring ATPase/kinase activity uses pyruvate kinase to couple ADP production to the conversation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate and then lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to convert pyruvate to lactateâwhich simultaneously oxidizes NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> resulting in a decrease of absorbance at 340 nm. B. Our alternative method uses ADP-HK to couple ADP production to the phosphorylation of glucose which is then used by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) to convert glucose-6-phosphate to gluconate-6-phosphateâwhich simultaneously reduces NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH resulting in an increase of absorbance at 340 nm.<br/></p></p>

For each substrate concentration the A<sub>340</sub> change was recorded in triplicate and the corresponding difference between the curve baseline and plateau was measured. The initial rate, an approximation of the steady-state rate, was determined by calculating the curve slope for the first 30 s of the reaction.<br/>  The assay is sensitive from low micromolar concentration of ADP to millimolar concentration. Recordings using 10 ÂµM to 3,000 ÂµM ADP showed that at increasing ADP concentrations the reaction rate increased such that at up to 3,000 ÂµM ADP, glucose and NAD<sup>+</sup> were not rate limiting.<br/>  To determine ADP specificity over ATP, 100 ÂµM of each substrate was measured for the reaction rate and the total A<sub>340</sub> change (Figure 3B). ATP produced no measurable activity with a total A<sub>340</sub> change of 0.006 Â± 0.000 at an initial rate of 0.002 Â± 0.000 A<sub>340</sub>/s. Conversely, ADP produced a measurable reaction with a total A<sub>340</sub> change of 0.7 Â± 0.1 at an initial rate of 1.42 Â± 0.00 A<sub>340</sub>/s. Therefore ADP produced 116 times higher final signal than ATP at 705 times faster rate. The A<sub>340</sub> implied 113 ÂµM NADH, suggesting that the 100 ÂµM ADP produced NADH stoichiometrically in the assay, and that the reaction had gone to completion.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200423/20200423235909_7920.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.

The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically (Shimadzu, <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> UV-1601 </a> ) at 340 nm at 1 Hz and with a slit-length of 1 nm. Traces were plotted and analysed using Origin Pro software (OriginLab).<br/><br/></li><li>Michaelis-Menten kinetics of GAPDH-CP12-PRK<br/>Michaelis-Menten curves of phosphoribulokinase (PRK) activity were measured for oxidized and reduced GAPDH-CP12-PRK to determine the redox dependent inactivation of the kinase (Figure 4) (McFarlane <em>et al.</em>, 2019). PRK is a sugar kinase that phosphorylates ribulose-5-phosphate to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate using ATP. The GAPDH-CP12-PRK complex was purified to homogeneity and the activity of PRK was measured at increasing concentrations of ATP to determine the Michaelis-Menten constants of PRK within the GAPDH-CP12-PRK complex under oxidizing and reducing conditions.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200423/20200423235933_5448.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 4. GAPDH-CP12-PRK Michaelis-Menten curves.</strong> Michaelis-Menten fits of oxidized (ox) and reduced (red) GAPDH-CP12-PRK (McFarlane <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>  Measuring Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the complex allowed detection of any changes of PRK activity in a substrate concentration dependent manner and the low background of the ADP-HK assay allowed accurate determination of the extent of inactivation. In the presence of excess Ru5P (2.5 mM), the rate of ADP production was measured at increasing ATP concentrations. Initial rates for each trace was measured by fitting a straight line over the initial 30 s. Rates were then plotted and fitted to a Michaelis-Menten equation.<br/>  Pre-formed oxidized complex showed zero measurable activity for all ATP concentrations and the reduced complex showed activity with a K<sub>M</sub> of 40 Â± 2 ÂµM and and V<sub>max</sub> of 13.6 Â± 0.3 s<sup>â1</sup>. These values correspond to the fact that the oxidized complex is completely inactive for PRK activity and that the inactivation is independent of ATP concentration. When the complex is chemically reduced, phosphoribulokinase is activated and conforms to Michaelis-Menten kinetics by showing increased activity at increased ATP concentration until the maximal velocity in reached.<br/><br/></li></ol><p class="ppzz" style="margin-left:15px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>The protocol described here demonstrates how the specificity of ADP-hexokinase from <em>T. litoralis</em> can be used in a coupled enzyme reaction to measure ATPase or kinase activities. The materials and equipment required for this assay are commonly accessible allowing for sensitive measurements to be obtained without purchasing expensive commercial kits. The assay produces a rapid and stoichiometric conversion of ADP to an absorbance signal that can be measured continuously and the high specificity and sensitivity ensures low background and therefore accurate kinetic measurements.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32976">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Reaction buffer<br/>50 mM Tris<br/>150 mM NaCl<br/>10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>pH 7.9<br/>Dissolve 6.02 g of Tris, 8.76 g of NaCl and 0.95 g of MgCl<sub>2</sub> in 1 L of ultrapure water</li><li>ATPase/kinase<br/>Determine the ATPase/Kinase protein concentration for example using a Pierce BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay (Thermo Fisher) and prepare the ATPase/Kinase in a stock concentration of 100 ÂµM in the reaction buffer.</li><li>1,000 Units/ml G6PDH<ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve lyophilized G6PDH powder in 100 Âµl of reaction buffer</li><li>Store at 4 Â°C and use within 1 month</li></ol></li><li>50 mM NAD<sup>+</sup> <ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve contents of a 25 mg vial in 753 Âµl of ultrapure water</li><li>Dispense into 80 ÂµM aliquots and stored at -80 Â°C</li></ol></li><li>100 mM ADP<ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 100 mg of ADP into 2.34 ml of ultrapure water</li><li>Dispense into 100 Âµl aliquots and store at -80 Â°C</li></ol></li><li>100 mM ATP<ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 100 mg of ADP into 1.81 ml of ultrapure water</li><li>Dispense into 100 Âµl aliquots and store at -80 Â°C</li></ol></li><li>1 M Glucose<br/>Dissolve 180 mg of D-glucose into 1 ml of reaction buffer on the day of the experiment</li><li>2x Assay reagent (2.5 ml)<br/>50 Âµg/ml ADP-HK<br/>20 mM Glucose<br/>800 ÂµM NAD<sup>+</sup><br/>8 Units G6PDH<br/>Add 25 Âµl of 5 mg/ml ADP-HK, 50 Âµl of 1 M Glucose, 40 Âµl of 50 mM NAD<sup>+</sup>, 20 Âµl of 1,000 Units/ml G6PDH and 2.36 ml of buffered saline solution<br/><em>Note: The assay was developed under the conditions given, however it is likely that some variation can be tolerated.
