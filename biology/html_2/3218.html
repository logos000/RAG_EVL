            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is a trimeric protein holoenzyme with kinase activity. AMPK plays an important role in cellular metabolism and is thought to function as a fuel sensor within the cell, exerting kinase activity to activate energy-conserving pathways and simultaneously inhibit energy-consuming pathways. Traditional <em>in vitro</em> methods to measure AMPK activity to test potential agonists or antagonists utilize radiolabeled ATP with a peptide substrate. Although radiolabeling provides a high level of sensitivity, this approach is not ideal for medium to high-throughput screening, dose-response curves, or kinetic analyses. Our protocol utilizes Invitrogenâs Zâ-LYTE<sup>TM</sup> Kinase Assay Kit (Ser/Thr 23 Peptide) to measure changes in the enzymatic activity of AMPKÉ2Î²1Î³1 in the presence of a molecular chaperone. The Zâ-LYTE<sup>TM</sup> platform is based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). The AMPK peptide substrate (S/T 23 peptide: MRPRKRQGSVRRRV) is a self-contained FRET system, using coumarin as the donor and fluorescein as the acceptor. When the peptide is phosphorylated, it is sensitive to cleavage by a site-specific protease. The cleavage of the phospho-peptide eliminates the FRET pair, and the ratiometric analysis of FRET is used as an indirect measure of AMPK kinase activity. This method does not require the use of radiolabeling or antibodies and is used in a multi-well format, with high reproducibility and throughput capabilities. </p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>AMPK plays an important role in cellular metabolism (Ross <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Dysfunction in AMPK signaling is associated with a wide range of pathophysiological conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, neurological diseases, and aging (Ronnebaum <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Therefore, identifying activators and inhibitors of AMPK activity are important both in the development of therapeutics and to study off-target effects of other small molecules. We previously determined the chaperone effect of the enzyme CHIP on AMPKÎ±1 and AMPKÎ±2 holoenyzmes by measuring the phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide in the presence of radiolabeled ATP (Schisler <em>et al.</em>, 2013). While sensitive, laboratories commonly utilize a spotting technique (each condition must be spotted individually) that is time sensitive (reactions can saturate within minutes), making dose response experiments and the simultaneous screening of multiple compounds difficult (Hastie <em>et al.</em>, 2006). In a more recent study, we adapted a commercial FRET-based assay to study the effect of CHIP mutations on AMPK activity (Shi <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p>

Emission data is collected at 445 nm and 520 nm and used to calculate the emission ratio (445/520, Figure 5A). These data are then used to calculate the percent phosphorylation (Figure 5B):<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190415/20190415233031_6355.jpg" width="450"/><br/><br/>where, Ratio = emission ratio of signal intensity collected at 445 nm divided by signal intensity collected 520 nm from an individual well; <br/>F<sub>100%</sub> = mean fluorescein (445 nm) emission signal intensity of the 100% phosphorylation control (row K, Figure 4); <br/>C<sub>100%</sub> = Average coumarin (520 nm) emission signal intensity of the 100% phosphorylation control (row K, Figure 4);<br/>F<sub>0%</sub> = Average fluorescein emission signal intensity of the 0% phosphorylation control (row J, Figure 4);<br/>C<sub>0%</sub> = Average coumarin emission signal intensity of the 0% phosphorylation control (row J, Figure 4).<br/><br/>  We first determined the concentration of AMPK to be used in our reactions. Our study focused on agonist activity, however it is ideal to use conditions that can account for either direction of change in AMPK activity. This can be accomplished by first measuring the Zâ-factor. The Zâ-factor is a measure of statistical effect size (1 being the highest value) and is used to evaluate sensitivity and variability of the performance of a high throughput assay. Each prep of AMPK should be first tested to determine the starting concentration that yields a phosphorylation level suitable for the assay. In this example, AMPK at 730 nM with ATP at 50 ÂµM resulted in 33% phosphorylation (Figure 5), corresponding to a Zâ value of 0.66 using the manufactureâs calculation. The manufacture suggests assays should be done using AMPK and ATP concentrations that result in 20%-50% peptide phosphorylation, with Zâ values &gt; 0.5.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190415/20190415233108_4171.jpg" width="222"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.
