            <h1>Isolation of Neutrophil Nuclei for Use in NETosis Assays</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Neutrophils are critical immune cells that protect our body against invading pathogens. They generate antibacterial DNA structures called neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Recently we identified a new mechanism that enables NET formation. We observed that following recognition of lipopolysaccharides, inflammatory caspases cleave Gasdermin D and enable NET generation (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2018). This protocol describes how we purify neutrophil nuclei to visualize NET formation by live microscopy. After neutrophil purification from murine bone marrow, neutrophils are lysed in a hypotonic buffer using a nitrogen cavitation device to prevent lysis of neutrophil granules and subsequent contamination by granules proteases. Lysed neutrophils are then centrifuged, and nuclei are counted. The protocol described here is straightforward and enables the study of early changes happening in the nuclei of neutrophils undergoing NETosis with limited contamination by granule proteases.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>NETosis is a neutrophil-specific host-defense mechanism that enables DNA extrusion to trap bacteria during infection (Papayannopoulos, 2018). This process is associated with dramatic changes in neutrophil nucleus structure and the release of DNA and chromatin outside the neutrophil. NETosis is studied mostly by microscopy using live or fixed neutrophils stimulated with various triggers like bacterium or Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Gonzalez <em>et al.</em>, 2014). We recently described that netosis can be activated upon detection of intracellular LPS by the noncanonical inflammasome (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Using purified neutrophil nuclei, we showed that incubation of nuclei with recombinant Gasdermin D (Shi <em>et al.</em>, 2015), a pore-forming protein, and the inflammatory caspase-11, is sufficient to trigger nuclear changes that are associated with NETosis. Here we offer a simple framework to study NET generation on purified nuclei to visualize early changes happening before and during DNA extrusion. Our protocol enables the study of NET formation without contamination by neutrophil proteases [which can also trigger NET formation (Papayannopoulos, 2018)] and was developed to study the role of Gasdermin D during the early step of NET formation.</p>

Alternatively, neutrophils can also be purified as described in (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2014).

Too high pressure may disrupt neutrophil granules and contaminate your nuclei preparation.</em> </li><li>Take a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and place it close to the lower valve.
