            <h1>Assessments of HLA-I Specificities of Anti-HLA-I Monoclonal Antibodies Using Solid Phase Bead Arrays</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anita J. Zaitouna, Daniel S. Ramon, Malini Raghavan</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules are a group of structurally-related cell surface proteins with a high degree of variability within the population. While only up to six variants are expressed in an individual person, the whole population contains thousands of different variants. The ability to distinguish specific variants is important in the clinic to determine compatibility during organ and bone marrow transplantation and in the laboratory to study the biological properties of individual variants. Solid phase bead arrays contain purified, individually identifiable HLA-I molecules that can be used to determine antibody specificity for individual HLA-I proteins. This method is high-throughput, highly specific, and allows for simultaneous screening of antibodies against multiple HLA-I allotypes. The beads are particularly useful for screening patient sera for the presence of donor-specific antibodies against individual HLA-I variants (which can arise during pregnancy, blood transfusion, or organ transplantation). Alternate approaches, such as the use of individual HLA-I-expressing cell lines, are more time consuming, and such cell lines are difficult to procure and standardize. The HLA-I beads are also useful to study HLA-I specificity and selectivity for other receptors and binding partners.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Human leukocyte antigen molecules are classified as class I (HLA-I) or class II (HLA-II). Generally, HLA-I are found on all nucleated cells and bind to T cell receptors of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas HLA-II are found on specialized immune cells called antigen presenting cells and bind to T cell receptors of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The major receptors for HLA-I and HLA-II proteins are T cell receptors in conjunction with the co-receptors CD8 or CD4, although other receptors, proteins, and antibodies are known to functionally interact with both sets of molecules. HLA-I molecules comprise a highly polymorphic heavy chain, an invariant light chain (Î²2-microglbulin), and a short peptide. Solid phase bead arrays containing HLA molecules are widely used to screen patient sera for monitoring the presence of antibodies against specific HLA-I and HLA-II allotypes (Lachmann <em>et al.</em>, 2013), as such antibodies mediate transplant rejection in organ and bone marrow transplantations. Solid phase bead arrays containing individual HLA-I (or HLA-II) proteins can also be used to identify HLA interactions with various receptors and assembly factors (for example, Garcia-Beltran <em>et al.</em>, 2016 and Ilca <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In Yarzabek <em>et al.</em> (2018), monoclonal antibodies against known epitopes on HLA-I heavy chains, called Bw4 or Bw6 epitopes (MÃ¼ller <em>et al.</em>, 1989; residues 77-83 of the HLA-I heavy chain) were bound to purified HLA-I-containing solid phase beads, with the goal of determining each antibodyâs selectivity for Bw4 or Bw6 epitopes on individual HLA-I molecules. W6/32, a pan HLA-I antibody (Barnstable <em>et al.</em>, 1978; Raghavan <em>et al.</em>, 2019), was used to account for potential variations in HLA-I protein levels on the beads. Here we describe the detailed procedures for using HLA-I bead arrays to measure anti-Bw4 and anti-Bw6 selectivity and specificity for various HLA-I molecules, expanding on the protocols used in Yarzabek <em>et al.</em> (2018).</p>

Briefly, data analysis is performed similar to flow cytometry analysis, where each pool of HLA-I beads has multiple HLA-I-bead conjugates, each of which is uniquely identified based on the fluorescence intensity of the beads (Luminex xMAP technology, Figure 1). Relative binding of the antibodies (PE signal) are assessed by first correcting for non-specific antibody binding to a negative control bead (which is included as a component of the Labscreen Single Antigen HLA class-I Combination bead suspension array) (example results in Figure 2).<br/>  The FlowPRA single antigen bead binding data are collected on a flow cytometer, where the individual HLA-I beads are identified based on different fluorescence intensities in the PE channel (as shown in Figure 3) and the ligand is identified in the FITC channel. Note that a compensation has to be performed for this experiment. Similar to the above protocol, the relative ligand signal (FITC) is corrected with the negative control bead (Figure 3, bead 8, teal), as well as an isotype control. The FlowPRA single antigen beads come as four groups (covering common HLA-A and HLA-B allotypes). To screen a wider array of HLA-I, additional bead groups have to be included.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200616/20200616210610_2997.jpg" width="179"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

FlowPRA Single Antigen Beads sample data.</strong> FlowPRA single antigen beads come as four groups, each containing 8 HLA-I beads and one negative control bead (without HLA-I labeled 8, and colored teal in dot plots) that are individually identifiable in the PE channel. The beads are successively incubated and washed: biotinylated antibody, buffer, streptavidin-FITC, buffer. They are then measured on a flow cytometer. The dot plots are from a representative experiment, where isotype control, IgG2a (left panel), or W6/32 (right panel) were incubated with Group 1 of FlowPRA single antigen beads.<br/><br/>Additional normalization methods can be performed by taking the background corrected values for anti-Bw4 or anti-Bw6, which bind certain HLA-I molecules (Yarzabek <em>et al.</em>, 2018) and calculating the signals as a ratio relative to the W6/32 signal, an antibody known to bind all HLA-I variants (Raghavan <em>et al.</em>, 2019) (Figure 2). This radiometric method accounts for potential variations in HLA-I levels on the Labscreen Single Antigen HLA class-I Combination bead suspension array.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34375">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">The authors acknowledge NIH grants (R01 AI044115 (MR), RO1 AI123957 (MR), R21 AI126054 (MR), T32 AI007528 (for support of AZ), T32 AI007413 (for support of AZ)).
