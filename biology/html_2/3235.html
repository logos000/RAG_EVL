            <h1>Visualization of Macropinocytosis in Prostate Fibroblasts</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rajeev   Mishra, Neil A. Bhowmick</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Macropinocytosis has emerged as an important mechanism for non-selective route to internalize extracellular fluids and dissolved molecules in eukaryotic cell. As fundamental cellular behavior, macropinocytosis plays specific and distinct roles in many physiological and pathological processes, such as nutrients uptake, antigen presentation, pathogen capture, and tumorigenesis. It supports tumorigenesis by providing metabolic needs to dividing cells in <em>Ras</em> driven cancer. In recent years, macropinocytosis has gained considerable interest in physiology and various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and atherosclerosis, which in turn has led to the discovery of new endocytic recycling systems. Approaches to assess macropinocytosis will provide insight into its underlying regulatory molecular mechanisms and enable the physiological control of macropinocytosis for controlled drug delivery and targeted cancer therapy. Macropinocytosis is an important phenomenon in Ras-expressing cancer cells and, recently, we have revealed a functional role for macropinocytosis in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) fueling cancer cell growth. Here, we describe a protocol for detection of macropinocytosis in prostatic fibroblasts <em>in vitro</em> by utilizing fluorescently-labeled, lysine-fixable, 70 kDa high molecular weight dextran. Macropinosomes are visualized as fluorescent intracellular puncta either by confocal or fluorescent microscopy. To follow, subsequent intracellular events and their underlying mechanisms after macropinosomes formation, we perform co-localization of quenched BSA (DQ<sup>TM</sup>-BSA) along with dextran labeling in cancer associated fibroblasts. Our protocol provides a consistent way to understand macropinocytosis in wild type or genetic manipulated prostatic fibroblast.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Macropinocytosis or âcell drinkingâ is a type of endocytosis that involves the nonspecific uptake of extracellular fluid into large intracellular vesicles known as macropinosomes (Swanson and Watts, 1995). The macropinosomes are heterogeneous in size and shape, with their diameters ranging between 0.2 and 5 micrometers (Lim and Gleeson, 2011). The <em>Src</em> and <em>Ras</em> are prominent oncogenes which stimulate macropinocytosis in various type of cancer (Bar-Sagi and Feramisco, 1986). Macropinocytosis has been prominently described in pancreatic cancer cells, recognized for having active Ras signaling (Commisso <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Davidson <em>et al.</em>, 2017). We determined that epigenetic activation of Ras signaling mediates macropinocytosis in prostatic cancer associated fibroblasts resulting in albumin uptake, lysosomal degradation, and release of constituent amino acids (Mishra <em>et al.</em>, 2018). These amino acids, predominantly glutamine, were found to support the metabolism and differentiation of the prostate cancer epithelial cells. Therefore, macropinocytosis is an important nutrient processing pathway to support the energetic needs of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and may represent a predictive biomarker for cancer therapy. The quantification of macropinocytosis can be achieved through confocal laser scanning microscopy.</p>

These macropinosomes further fused into lysosome and get degraded by their acidic enzymes (lysozymes). To rule out the background signal possibility in labeling macropinosomes, we also included negative control group by treating Ras overexpressing mouse fibroblasts with macropinocytosis inhibitors. In addition to negative control, experimental methods were set up to observe macropinosomes fusion in lysosomes and its degradation by lysozymes. To track lysosomes, LysoTracker green and for degradation DQ<sup>TM</sup>-BSA was used. The steps of the analysis are summarized below:</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>We follow four criteria to identify macropinosomes:<ol class="npwthree"><li>Dextran positive.</li><li>Excluded from the nucleus.</li><li>Surrounded by GFP-positive cytoplasm.</li><li>Fluorescence intensities of macropinosomes are comparable with or higher than that of the extracellular space. </li></ol></li><li>We have had the best results imaging these samples using a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Leica, Germany). </li><li>Images were acquired with a 60x 1.4 NA oil immersion lens. Different lasers were used that span the blue (457, 477, and 488 nanometers), green (514 and 543 nanometers), and red (633 and 647 nanometers) spectral regions. Fluorescence was recorded in individual channels acquired in a sequential mode to avoid cross-talk using a highly sensitive 32-channel gallium arsenide phosphide detector. The pinhole was set to 1 Airy unit.</li><li>As an example of the <em>in vitro</em> implementation of this protocol, we have assessed the extent of macropinocytosis in Ras-overexpressing mouse fibroblast.
