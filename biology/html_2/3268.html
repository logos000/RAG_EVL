            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Margaret E.  Driscoll, Callen  Hyland, Divya   Sitaraman</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Sleep is a conserved neurobehavioral state observed in animals with sufficiently complex nervous systems and is critical for survival. While the exact function of sleep remains unknown, the lack of sleep can have a range of physiological and behavioral effects. Studies in invertebrates and vertebrates have identified conserved neural mechanisms and cellular pathways in control of sleep, wakefulness and arousal. Methodologies to measure sleep have ranged from EEG recordings in humans and rodents to in-depth analysis of locomotor patterns in flies, fish and worms. Here we focus on sleep measurements using activity monitoring in the highly versatile experimental model system, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, which is amenable to a number of genetic, physiological and behavioral manipulations. Further, we also describe methods used to manipulate sleep and wakefulness to understand the neural regulation of sleep and how organisms balance sleep, wakefulness and behavioral arousal. Sleep as a behavioral state is regulated by a number of factors including food, environmental conditions, and genetic background. The methodologies described here provide, a high-throughput approach to study neural regulation of sleep and factors that affect this complex behavior.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Sleep is defined as a state of quiescence that is associated with periods of inactivity, altered brain activity, and heightened sensory threshold. Across species, sleep is tightly regulated by the circadian clock and homeostatic mechanisms, and these processes have been studied extensively in the context of sleep regulation (Hendricks <em>et al.</em>, 2000a and 2000b, Shaw <em>et al.</em>, 2000, Donlea <em>et al.</em>, 2017, Keene and Duboue, 2018, Bringmann, 2019). While the importance of these processes in sleep and wake cycling cannot be overstated, the dynamic regulation of sleep, wakefulness and arousal by other behavioral drives like social engagement and nutritional status have received less attention.<br/><br/>We recently investigated how sleep is regulated in light of competing behavioral drives like courtship and found that sleep is suppressed when the courtship drive is elevated, and courtship behavior is suppressed when sleep drive is increased by deprivation (Aso <em>et al.</em>, 2014, Sitaraman <em>et al.</em>, 2015a and 2015b, Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Here we describe the methods to measure and manipulate sleep amount (by mechanical deprivation and pharmacological treatments) and structure using the high-throughput activity monitoring system that is relatively easy to set-up and comparable to high-resolution video monitoring studies. The sleep recording protocol described here uses the well-established activity monitoring system relying on occlusion of infrared beam by movement of singly housed flies. While a previously published article describes the use of <em>Drosophila</em> activity monitoring system for circadian analysis and sleep, here emphasis is placed on the actual fly rearing, set-up of the activity monitors and circadian analysis (Chiu <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Here, we describe the experimental set-up specific to sleep measurements and the detailed analysis of the locomotor data in interpreting sleep amount and architecture. The experimental amenability of the fruit fly system has and will continue to provide key insights into how sleep is influenced by neuronal and environmental factors with careful attention to experimental design, execution, and data interpretation.<br/></p>

Stocks that were sick and not laying enough eggs were transferred to fly media containing molasses (see Fly Food Recipe). Flip stock flies onto fresh food at least once per month.<br/><br/></li><li>Fly collection for sleep assays<br/>Collect 32 male flies on a CO<sub>2</sub> fly pad under a stereo microscope and place into a standard food vial. Maintain collected flies at 21-25 Â°C under the same 12:12 h light/dark cycle and 50% RH for at least two days prior to the sleep assay.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Virgin and mated female flies sleep differently and to prevent female flies from laying eggs in the tube we only test virgin female flies. However, this difference can vary depending on genotype and genetic background. Several studies also use sleep tubes containing 5% sucrose and 1% agarose as it prevents egg-laying.</li><li>Use adult flies that are age-matched and in the range of 3-7 days post-eclosion for sleep assays.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Preparation of Sleep Tubes<ol class="npwtwo"><li>One day before the trial is to be loaded, make sleep tubes to ensure that the food has appropriate moisture and hardness for 3-7 days of sleep recordings (see Recipes). Wrap a rubber band around bundles of 32 sleep tubes; one bundle will be needed per DAM being loaded (can be done in advance, see Figure 1A). While fly media is still hot, pour ~100 ml into each Petri dish. Immediately place bundles of sleep tubes upright into the Sleep Food such that the bundle stands independently with the open ends of the tubes submerged. The submerged portions of the tube will be filled with fly media, which will serve as a food and water source during the experiment. Ensure that tubes are not standing at an angle, as this will result in uneven food levels. Up to seven bundles will fit into each Petri dish. Cover drying sleep tube bundles with cheesecloth.</li><li>When the media in the tube is solidified at room temperature (~30 min), remove the cheesecloth and carefully remove sleep tube bundles from the Sleep Food, ensuring that a plug of agarose remains in each tube. Remove the rubber band and clean the media from the sides of the sleep tubes with a paper towel. Dip the food-containing end of each sleep tube into paraffin wax two to three times to coat this end completely. It is not necessary to wait for the wax to dry between dips, but allow wax to solidify after all dips for approximately 5 s. If wax drips off the end leaving the food exposed, dip again until the food is completely covered. Place waxed tubes onto paper towels to dry at room temperature.<br/><em>Note: Store dry waxed tubes overnight in a refrigerator in a sealed container with a damp paper towel to maintain humidity. Tubes stored for more than one day may dry out and be unusable.</em> </li><li>Remove tubes from the refrigerator at least 2 h before their use to ensure there is no condensation inside and let them equilibrate to room temperature before loading flies.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190616/20190616195225_7457.jpg" width="382"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

With the fly inside, cap the open, non-waxed end with a piece of pipe cleaner. Place loaded tubes aside until 32 tubes have been filled.</li><li>Place sleep tubes into the far right and far left columns of the monitor first (see Figure 1B). Push each tube into the holes of the monitor such that the pipe-cleaner end is protruding more than the waxed end.</li><li>Place a rubber band around the top two rows of tubes (see Figure 1B). Do the same for the bottom two rows.</li><li>Place the remaining tubes alternately above and below the rubber band so that they fit snugly and do not move freely (see Figures 1A-1D).</li><li>When all tubes are loaded, align all tubes such that the center of the tube is in the center of the DAM. Align tubes by pressing the loaded DAM onto an even surface, like the tabletop, with the pipe-cleaner side down until the center of all tubes aligns with the center of the monitor. Note that this is the reason that the tubes were pushed further in the pipe cleaner direction in Step D3.</li><li>After loading all DAMs with sleep tubes, place DAMs into a 21 Â°C incubator set to 50% RH and the desired 12:12 h light/dark cycle the flies were entrained on previously.</li><li>Open DAM Software on the computer and enter monitor range. While you can load up to 120 monitors this is not recommended for sleep experiments as an activity reading has to be made every minute and loading more than 40 monitors can delay reading and cause errors in sleep measurements.</li><li>Plug the monitors into the power supply unit that plugs into the computer that records monitor data as described in (Chiu <em>et al.</em>, 2010).</li><li>Ensure that the monitor numbers which are plugged in appear yellow at first pass, then green as they are automatically scanned by the DAMFileScan software.</li><li>Leave monitors undisturbed in the incubator until the conclusion of the trial, changing the temperature if needed. For temperature-sensitive mutations, such as dTRP and Shibire (Kitamoto, 2001; Hamada <em>et al.</em>, 2008), typically the temperature will be 21 Â°C during Day 1, raised to 29 Â°C at 9:30 AM (lights on) on Day 2, and lowered back to 21 Â°C at 9:30 AM on Day 3. Typical constant temperature experiments last five days in the incubator at 21 Â°C or 25 Â°C.</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28072">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz">The locomotor data represented as occlusion of IR beams is output as a .txt file with date and time stamp information.

Latency/time it takes for the flies to start their first sleep bout after ZT (Zeitgeber time) where ZT 12 refers to lights off. G-H. Number of sleep bouts and average bout length of the tested genotypes are indicators of sleep fragmentation. Two genotypes were compared by non-parametric test (unpaired) Mann-Whitney test. Two tailed <em>P</em>-values were used to determine significance (***<em>P</em> &lt; 0.0001 and **<em>P</em> &lt; 0.001).<br/><br/><strong><em>Sleep manipulation</em></strong><br/>While genetic approaches to manipulate specific neurons are routinely used in <em>Drosophila</em> to study the neural regulation of sleep, there is an increased focus on measuring neural responses in flies with manipulated sleep drive (Kayser <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Beckwith <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Machado <em>et al.</em>, 2017). In addition to measuring neuronal responses to sleep manipulation, recent studies have also shown increase in expression of key genes after sleep-deprivation (Toda <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/>Here we describe methods to increase or decrease sleep drive using mechanical and pharmacological approaches.<ol class="npwtwo"><li><strong>Mechanical deprivation:</strong> This method entails intermittent shaking of the monitors displacing the flies at random intervals set by the DAM acquisition program. Sleep deprivation can be assessed by measuring sleep during deprivation in the sleep monitors as described above. After loading monitors, flies in the DAM monitor are placed on a horizontal vortexer. The vortexer power cord is attached to a light controller (LC4) that programs the power supply to the unit to deliver pulses that can be set using the DAM acquisition software. The pulse length and frequency can be controlled. We use 20-30 s of shaking per minute throughout the night delivered in pulses lasting 2,3,3,2 s. that are set to Rn setting that stands for random application following a normal distribution. The timing of the pulse, repeat period and distribution can be set at random normal, random uniform and blank/no random setting to increase or decrease the level of deprivation (Figure 8 shows a sample screenshot of the shaker set-up that produces mechanical pulses sufficient to induce sleep-deprivation in wild type CS flies). Flies typically deprived for 16 h show strong sleep rebound. The level of deprivation (sleep lost during deprivation as compared to baseline sleep) and rebound (sleep regained post-deprivation) are variable for different genotypes and genetic background.</li><li><strong>Pharmacological treatments:</strong> Alternatively, sleep can be manipulated by feeding flies pharmacological agents to induce arousal or sleep. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is added at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml to molten food for sleep tubes when it cools to 50-60 Â°C. Blue or red dye can be added to the food to ensure that flies are ingesting the drug. CBZ is prepared as a stock solution (20 mg/ml) solubilized in 45% (2-hydroxypropyl)-Î²-cyclodextrin as described in (Agosto <em>et al.</em>, 2008). CBZ affects both daytime and nighttime sleep in a manner that depends on the genetic manipulation and genetic background. Nighttime sleep induction can be achieved by treating flies with 0.1 mg/ml Gabaxadol (THIP) as described in Dissel <em>et al.</em>, 2015.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190616/20190616195905_0457.jpg" width="181"/><br/><strong>Figure 8. Sample screenshot of the DAM system software controlling mechanical pulses delivered using a Troemner vortexer.</strong> The vortexer is directly connected to the light controller that interfaces with the software to control the on time of pulses, duration of pulses and repeat period.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Genetic Deprivation: </strong>Several neurons have been implicated in inducing arousal and wakefulness as reviewed in (Donlea <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Nighttime activation of subsets of dopamine system neurons (labeled by broad dopamine drivers like Th-Gal4 or more targeted drivers like 54B-Gal4 as shown in Figure 9) and octopamine system neurons (targeted by Tdc2-Gal4) by mis-expression of dTrpA1, a temperature gated non-specific cation channel, induces increased wakefulness when the temperature is raised from 21 to 28-30 Â°C (Kume <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Crocker and Sehgal, 2008; Seidner <em>et al.</em>, 2015, Sitaraman<em>et al.</em>, 2015a and 2015b). Unlike mechanical deprivation we find that activation of these neurons does not always result in sleep rebound post deprivation when the temperature is lowered to 21 Â°C.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190616/20190616195955_1549.jpg" width="204"/><br/><strong>Figure 9.
