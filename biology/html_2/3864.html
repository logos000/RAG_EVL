            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Plant lipid metabolism is a dynamic network where synthesis of essential membrane lipids overlaps with synthesis of valuable storage lipids (<em>e.g.</em>, vegetable oils). Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is a key component of the chloroplast membrane system required for photosynthesis and is produced by multiple pathways within the lipid metabolic network. The bioengineering of plants to enhance oil production can alter lipid metabolism in unexpected ways which may not be apparent by static quantification of lipids, but changes to lipid metabolic flux can be traced with isotopic labeling commonly with [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate. Because lipid classes such as MGDG are composed of many different molecular species, full analysis of metabolically labeled lipids requires separation and quantification of the individually labeled molecular species which is traditionally performed by thin layer chromatography. Here we present a reverse phase HPLC method for the separation of MGDG molecular species from tobacco leaves in under 35 min. The quantification of each <sup>14</sup>C-labeled molecular species was accomplished by an in-line flow radio detector. This method of analysis for [<sup>14</sup>C]Acetate labeled MGDG molecular species by radio-HPLC provides a rapid, high throughput, and reliable analytical approach to identify changes in MGDG metabolism due to bioengineering or other perturbations of metabolism.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is a class of glycerolipid comprising of two fatty acid chains and a galactose moiety attached to the <em>sn</em>-1, -2, -3 positions of the glycerol backbone, respectively. MGDG is found as a major component in photosynthetic membranes of all plants. The complexity of MGDG lies in the chemical composition of acyl chains. Depending on the fatty acid carbon chain length and degree of unsaturation, each MGDG molecule could be further categorized into different molecular species, with different metabolic pathways leading to distinct molecular species compositions. In the research findings reported in the original research paper (Zhou <em>et al.</em>, 2020), [<sup>14</sup>C]acetate metabolic labeling of wild-type and bioengineered oil producing leaves of tobacco was utilized to understand how oil accumulation in leaves affected fatty acid flux into essential membrane lipids. Quantification of specific <sup>14</sup>C-labeled MGDG molecular species was utilized to estimate acyl flux through different branches of the lipid metabolic network. In this report we discuss a HPLC protocol for MGDG molecular species separation adapted from Yamauchi <em>et al.</em> (1982) and optimized for radio-HPLC quantification of <sup>14</sup>C-MGDG molecular species with in-line flow liquid scintillation counting as reported in Zhou <em>et al.</em> (2020).</p><br/></p>

The volume of injection solvent for the sample analysis illustrated in Figure 1 is 10 Î¼l and the total radioactivity per injection is approximately 17,500 Disintegrations Per Minute (DPM).

Since the method uses isocratic conditions, column equilibration is not necessary between each sample.</p></li><li><p>Once the sequence is saved, the method for the analysis will be loaded. The method conditions for the HPLC analysis are as described below:</p><ol class="npwthree"><li><p>Quaternary Pump: Solvent A: Methanol and Solvent B: Water. The method uses Isocratic elution with mobile phaseâ95%A/5%B. The flow is set at 0.35 ml/min and the run time is 35 min.</p></li><li><p>Autosampler: Autosampler temperature is set at 20 Â°C. Sample Injection solvent: Methanol. Set the injector settings in the method to as follows: Needle Draw Speedâ200 Î¼l/min, Needle eject Speedâ400 Î¼l/min, Wait Time after drawâ1.2 s.</p></li><li><p>Multi Column Compartment: The temperature of the column compartment is set at 35 Â°C. The mobile phase is allowed to pass through a Quick-Connect Heat Exchanger prior to entering the column. A short 10 mm guard column containing same material as that of the stationary phase is installed immediately prior to the analytical column.</p></li><li><p>UV-DAD: Direct the flow of eluate from the column to UV-DAD.

Set the type of analysis to Non-Stop Radio HPLC. The radio detector is equipped with a 500 Î¼l adjustable volume flow cell that facilitates the radio counting process. Set the flow cell volume to 300 Î¼l. Prior to entering the flow cell, the eluate from the UV-DAD is mixed with the scintillation cocktail whose flow is controlled by a scintillant pump. Set the scintillant flow to 1.05 ml/min (a 1:3 for eluate:scintillation cocktail ratio). The resulting residence time in the flow cell for these flow settings is 12.9 s. The recommended residence time for flow counting is above 5 s. The eluate mixed with scintillant from the radio detector is directed to the properly labeled radioactive HPLC waste container secured in a secondary waste container. In the method, adjust the detector settings of Radio 1 channel as follows: Measurement unitsâCPM, Dwell Timeâ1 s, Shift Timeâ0 s, Lower Limitâ200, Upper Limitâ9000.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>After the HPLC data acquisition is completed, proceed to data analysis.</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3864/bioprotoc-10-24-3864-g001.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.
