            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>With the advent of CRISPR-Cas and the ability to easily modify the genome of diverse organisms, rat models are being increasingly developed to interrogate the genetic events underlying mammary development and tumorigenesis. Protocols for the isolation and characterization of mammary epithelial cell subpopulations have been thoroughly developed for mouse and human tissues, yet there is an increasing need for rat-specific protocols. To date, there are no standard protocols for isolating rat mammary epithelial subpopulations. Analyzing changes in the rat mammary hierarchy will help us elucidate the molecular events in breast cancer, the cells of origin for breast cancer subtypes, and the impact of the tumor microenvironment. Here we describe several methods developed for 1) rat mammary epithelial cell isolation; 2) rat mammary fibroblast isolation; 3) culturing rat mammary epithelial cells; and characterization of rat mammary cells by 4) flow cytometric analysis; and 5) immunofluorescence. Cells derived from this protocol can be used for many purposes, including RNAseq, drug studies, functional assays, gene/protein expression analyses, and image analysis.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Most mammary-related research has been performed in mouse models and human samples. However, rat models of disease are becoming increasingly popular due to their human-like pharmacokinetic profile and mammary development (Russo <em>et al.</em>, 1990; Jiunn <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Smalley <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Like human adenocarcinomas, rat mammary carcinomas go through stages of histological progression (Russo <em>et al.</em>, 1990; Singh <em>et al.</em>, 2000) and are ovarian hormone dependent (Thompson <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Dischinger <em>et al.</em>, 2018), making them ideal models for human breast cancer research. Mammary development can be divided into distinct stages: embryonic, pubertal, adult, pregnancy/lactation, and involution. In order to investigate specific mammary cell populations, it is necessary to separate the mix of epithelial (parenchymal) and stromal (mesenchymal) cell populations within the mammary gland. The gland is composed of luminal secretory alveolar and ductal cells, and basally positioned myoepithelial cells organized into ducts that drain milk from lobuloalveolar structures (Stingl <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Shackleton <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Sleeman <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Asselin-Labat <em>et al.</em>, 2006). The luminal layer contains ER-negative cells, which are mostly proliferative progenitors, and terminally differentiated ER-positive cells (Shehata <em>et al.</em>, 2012). The basal layer consists of mammary stem cells and myoepithelial cells which function to mechanically contract alveolar cells to release milk droplets into the ductal lumen (Soady <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Luminal and basal cells are presumed to come from a bipotent progenitor, derived from a mammary stem cell (Shackleton <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Rios <em>et al.</em>, 2014). This differentiation state-dependent lineage is termed the mammary epithelial hierarchy and the delineation of this hierarchy has vastly improved our understanding of the origins of breast cancer (Lim <em>et al.</em>, 2009).<br/></p><p><br/>To study the rat mammary epithelial hierarchy, we developed a method to isolate rat mammary epithelial cells (MEC) from the extensive stromal components within the mammary fat pad. Following MEC isolation, we used immunophenotyping, morphology, and immunofluorescence to verify the identity of the selected cells. Concurrently, we assembled a panel of antibodies directed toward well-characterized antigens to prospectively isolate mammary cell populations. The cellular composition of mouse and human mammary glands has been well-defined by multicolor flow cytometric analysis of cell surface proteins (Tornillo <em>et al.</em>, 2015) by using highly optimized protocols (Smalley <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Previously, a panel of rat-specific antibodies to mammary markers was used to characterize the adult rat mammary parenchyma (Dundas <em>et al.</em>, 1991) while a different panel was used to quantify epithelial cell differentiation in adult carcinogen-treated rat mammary glands (Sharma <em>et al.</em>, 2011). To our knowledge, no one has used flow cytometry to profile mammary development in rats using pre-conjugated, commercially available antibodies. In this protocol, we used antibodies targeted to hematopoietic (CD45<sup>+</sup>) and endothelial (CD31<sup>+</sup>) cells to exclude lineage positive populations in freshly isolated, monodispersed mammary populations (Shackleton <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Then we used CD24 and CD29 to separate luminal (CD24<sup>hi</sup>CD29<sup>low</sup>) from basal/mammary stem cell enriched populations (CD24<sup>mid</sup>CD29<sup>hi</sup>, Shackleton <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Sleeman <em>et al.</em>, 2006). By combining the methods above, we are able to isolate, characterize, and culture distinct rat mammary gland cell populations to study their contribution to breast cancer.<br/></p>

Procedure</p><p>The dissociation of mammary tissue and generation of single cell suspension protocols were adapted for use on rat tissue from the STEMCELL Technologies technical bulletin on the Monolayer Culture of Mouse Mammary Epithelial Cells. Additionally, the Miltenyi Dead Cell Removal and QuadroMACs cell selection protocols were adapted for use on rat mammary tissue to remove lineage positive rat hematopoietic (CD45<sup>+</sup>) and endothelial cells (CD31<sup>+</sup>) from mammary epithelial cells. The workflow of this protocol can be found in Figure 1.</p><p><br/><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3818/bioprotoc-10-22-3818-g001.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Isolation of rat mammary epithelial cells and fibroblasts.</strong> The fourth mammary fat pads from female rats are removed and digested overnight. The following morning, adipocytes and red blood cells are depleted by centrifugation and lysis, respectively. The remaining cells are subjected to negative selection using Miltenyi CD31 and CD45 biotin conjugated antibodies. Next, addition of Miltenyi anti-biotin microbeads allows capture of the antibody tagged lineage positive populations on an LS column with a Miltenyi QuadroMACS magnet. The eluted MECs and fibroblasts are cultured in ultra-low attachment (ULA) plates for 48 hours to deplete fibroblasts. Purified MECs are then maintained in ULA with the addition of Y-27632 or plated into 2D culture for experimental analysis. Figure 1 was created with BioRender.com.</p><br/><ol class="npwone"><li><p>Dissociation of rat mammary tissue</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>Euthanize the rat by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation according to your institutional IACUC protocol.</p></li><li><p>Aseptically remove both fourth mammary fat pads from the rat, making sure to excise the entire ductal tree from the proximal nipple region out to the distal branches which may or may not have passed the lymph node, depending on the age. See Video 1 for rat mammary fat pad removal. Mammary development varies slightly among strains of rats. We exclusively use Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Charles River Labs that are bred in-house at VARI (Figure 2). Refer to Filgo <em>et al. </em>(2016) for approximate mammary tree size at specific ages in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (Filgo <em>et al.</em>, 2016) which is another commonly used rat strain. Keep in mind that the older the rat, the more developed the ductal tree and the more epithelial cells you will be able to isolate. Unfortunately, we observe decreased percent survival of digested cells from older rats compared to younger rats using this protocol (see Table 1). The decreased viability affects how many cells can be negatively selected. The fourth mammary fat pad is the largest and easiest fat pad to remove, but any fat pad may be substituted. Note that the first, second, fifth, and sixth fat pads are near muscle, and muscle contamination is not accounted for in our flow cytometry gating strategy.</p><p><br/><!--video3818-1å¼å§--></p><div class="videodiv" id="vd3818-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3818-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3818/3818-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="video"><strong>Video 1.

Because mammary stroma is highly enriched in collagen, we coat our plates with a thin coat of rat skin collagen to which the cells can make much stronger attachments. MECs from our rats prefer rat skin collagen to commercially available rat tail collagen, although this can be used as a substitute.
