            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Primary culture of mouse hippocampal neurons is a very useful <em>in vitro</em> model for studying neuronal development, axonal and dendritic morphology, synaptic functions, and many other neuronal features. Here we describe a step-by-step process of generating primary neurons from mouse embryonic hippocampi (E17.5/E18.5). Hippocampal neurons generated with this protocol can be plated in different tissue culture dishes according to different experimental aims and can produce a reliable source of pure and differentiated neurons in less than one week. This protocol covers all the steps necessary for the preparation, culture and characterization of the neuronal culture, including the illustration of dissection instruments, surgical procedure for embryosâ isolation, culturing conditions and assessment of cultureâs purity and differentiation. Evaluation of neuronal activity was performed by analysis of calcium imaging dynamics at six days in culture.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The hippocampus is a very well-characterized brain structure critical for important cerebral functions such as memory, spatial navigation, emotional memory and learning. Anatomically, the murine hippocampus has a well-defined, C-shaped structure that is easy to locate and isolate. At the cellular level, it is mainly composed of pyramidal cells with fewer interneurons and glial cells compared to other brain regions (Kaech and Banker, 2006). As such, the hippocampus is an ideal region for generating primary neuron cultures of high purity from wild-type or genetically engineered mouse models that can be used for disease modeling or to investigate multiple aspects of neuronal function such as synaptic transmission and electrophysiological properties, sensitivity to neurotoxicity, differentiation and aging (Busche, 2018; Koyama and Ikegaya, 2018; Molnar, 2011; Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Rush <em>et al.</em>, 2020).<br/><br/>Many protocols have been developed for generating cortical and hippocampal neuron cultures by co-culturing neurons with glial feeders (Kaech and Banker, 2006) describing three-dimensional neuronal culture systems with astrocytes encapsulated in hydrogel microfibers (Kim <em>et al.</em>, 2020), supplementing culture medium with growth factors for long-term neuron cultures (Ray <em>et al.</em>, 1993), or generating neurons from post-natal mice (Beaudoin <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Each of these methodologies presents advantages and disadvantages depending on the goals of the experiment. Here, we extend and describe in detail a protocol for generating hippocampal neurons that we have developed and successfully employed over the years (<em>e.g.</em>, Dorsey <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Tomassoni-Ardori <em>et al.</em>, 2019). We focus primarily on providing an easy, simple and reliable procedure for obtaining primary hippocampal neurons from mice at the late embryonic stage (E17.5-E18.5). We illustrate the whole preparation process including aspects that have often been omitted in other protocols such as a description of dissection instruments and surgical procedures for embryos removal and dissection. We report analysis of neuronal differentiation and function after 6 days in culture by testing for neuronal differentiation markers and neuronal activity by cellular calcium imaging dynamics. Moreover, we show the levels of neuronal culture purity in relation to glial cells with and without treatment with the glial inhibitor cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C).<br/><br/>This step-by-step protocol allows the experimenter to obtain differentiated hippocampal neurons with a high degree of purity within 6 days.<br/></p>

Transfer poly-D-lysine/laminin coated coverslips directly into wells of a 24-well plate by using sterile forceps in a sterile laminar flow hood before plating neurons. Alternatively, regular 12 mm coverslips can be coated by placing them into 24-well plate wells and covering them with 0.1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine for 20 min in a laminar flow hood. After that wash twice with PBS and cover with a 10 Âµg/ml laminin solution for at least 4 h at 37 Â°C by leaving the coverslips in an incubator until cells are ready to be plated. Rinse twice with PBS just before plating the cell to prevent the culture surface from drying. The 1 mg/ml laminin stock solution is made by adding 1 ml of PBS into 1 mg laminin powder and diluting to 10 Âµg/ml laminin with PBS.

Transfer one embryo head at a time into the 100 mm dish containing complete DMEM medium and gently remove the brain from the embryo head (Figure 4A). Specifically, with one hand, use forceps (Figure 1B) to pinch the mouth/nose area of the head (black arrow in Figure 3D). With the other hand, use the fine scissors (Figure 1C) to enter from the back of the skull (black scissors in Figure 3D) and execute a transversal cut (along the transversal plane at the mouth/nose level indicated by the white dashed line in Figure 3D) in order to free the basal brain region. Invert the embryo head to expose the free basal area of the brain. Continue by using two forceps (Figure 1B) to gently pull apart the skull and carefully remove the whole brain (Figure 4A). Transfer and collect the brains into a new 100 mm dish containing clean, ice-cold complete DMEM medium. Replace the medium after each brain dissection to eliminate the blood.</li><li>Transfer one brain at a time to a 35 mm dish lid filled with ice-cold complete DMEM medium and move under a dissection stereoscope.<br/><em>Note: The lower depth of the lid of a 35 mm dish allows for better movements when using dissection instruments compared to the bottom of the 35 mm dish.</em> </li><li>Use two curved forceps (Figure 1D): hold the brain on the side with one forceps (white dots in Figure 4A) and insert the second forceps along the midline (dashed line in Figure 4A) to separate the two hemispheres of the brain. Continue to use curved forceps to gently pull apart and flip the two halves of the brain in order to expose and visualize the hippocampal area (Figures 4B-4C).<br/><em>Note: Due to the fragility and softness of the embryonal tissues, the brain can be easily damaged while trying to dissect the hippocampal region: always use care when handling and holding embryonal brains. A few practicing sessions at the stereoscope will help to improve dissecting skills quickly.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200730/20200730032134_2029.jpg" width="220"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.

Seed the cells in the tissue culture dish/plate previously coated with poly-D-lysine.<br/><em>Note: Cell yield is approximately 400,000-600,000 cells/embryo. Prepare complete medium for neuronal culture by adding 10 ml of B27 supplement and 5 ml of P/S antibiotics (100x concentrate) into 500 ml of Neurobasal medium. Some protocols (e.g., Ruhl et al., 2019) suggest to pre-plate neurons for one hour in DMEM medium with 10% FBS to facilitate neuron adhesion to the plate. However, we have found that plating directly in Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement is sufficient for good neuron adhesion.</em> </li><li>After 18 to 24 h from the initial plating, add cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) to the culture to stop the proliferation of dividing cells (non-neuronal cells). Remove half of the volume of the culture medium (Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement) and replace it with fresh medium containing 2 ÂµM Ara-C (1 ÂµM Ara-C final concentration).<br/><em>Note: Failing to add Ara-C to a primary neuron culture will considerably affect the purity of the culture (Figures 8B and 8F). Death of some mitotic cells can be observed after adding Ara-C to the neuron culture.</em> </li><li>Culture the primary hippocampal neurons by replacing only half of the medium every 48 to 72 h. It is not necessary to continue adding Ara-C when replacing medium after the initial treatment. After 6 days in culture, the primary neurons will be well developed and differentiated as assessed by both morphology but especially expression of typical neuronal markers such as Tubulin-Î²-III, NeuN, Rbfox1, neurotrophin receptors and several other neuronal proteins (Tomassoni-Ardori et al., 2019) (Figure 8 and Figure 9).<br/><em>Notes:</em><br/><ol class="npwthree"><li><em>Replacing only half of the culture medium maintains the growth factors naturally secreted and present in the neuronal conditioned medium.</em> </li><li><em>Although absolute prevention of microbial contamination (bacteria, mycoplasma, fungi) during the preparation of primary cell cultures is impossible, these steps can greatly improve the outcome: i) work in a sterile environment; ii) use proper aseptic technique including wearing sterile gloves and using sterile glassware and disposable pipettes and tips; iii) keep all the equipment clean (dissecting microscope, incubators, centrifuges and water baths).</em> </li></ol><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200730/20200730032509_3187.jpg" width="196"/><br/><strong>Figure 8.
