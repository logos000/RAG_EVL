            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Cannabis seed germination is an important process for growers and researchers alike. Many biotechnological applications require a reliable sterile method for seed germination. This protocol outlines a seed germination procedure for <em>Cannabis sativa</em> using a hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) solution as liquid germination media. In this protocol, all three steps including seed sterilization, germination, and seedlings development were carried out in an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution of different concentrations; 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution showed the fastest and the most efficient germination. This protocol also exhibited high germination efficiency for very old cannabis seeds with lower viability. Overall, this protocol demonstrates superior germination compared to water control and reduces the risk of contamination, making it suitable for tissue culture and other sensitive applications.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p><em>Cannabis sativa</em>, otherwise known as marijuana or hemp, is an annual primarily dioecious flowering plant in which male/female sex is determined by heteromorphic chromosomes (X and Y) (Gaudet <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Cannabis is grown for a variety of agricultural uses; nearly all parts of cannabis plant are used, seeds for food, stem for fiber, and flowers/leaves for medicine. Flowers produce a mix of cannabinoids and aromatic compounds valued for their therapeutic and recreational effects (Chandra <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Cannabis plants are propagated either clonally through cuttings or via seed germination. Seed germination is very important for researchers, breeders, and growers alike, especially since seeds from elite cultivars can be very expensive and valuable. Additionally, older seeds may have a reduced germination rate while bacterial and fungal contamination can compromise germination, especially when seeds are germinated for tissue culture propagation. To address these issues, we have developed a rapid, sterile, and efficient seed germination protocol using a 1% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) solution. In this protocol, all three steps including seed sterilization, germination, and seedlings development were carried out in a 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution. This presents a significant advantage over other sterilants, such as mercuric chloride or bleach, which require additional washing of seeds and a separate germination step on MS solid medium. Our protocol resulted in faster germination and increased seed germination percentage as compared to water control, with no bacterial or fungal contamination, making it suitable for tissue culture and other sensitive applications. In comparison to previous germination methods which take between 4-7 days for radicle appearance and 5-15 days for seedling development (Wielgus <em>et al.</em>, 2008 and references therein), our germination method resulted in radicle appearance in 1 day and allowed us to obtain cannabis seedlings in a very short period (3-7 days) with minimal efforts. This protocol is also very efficient for germination of very old cannabis seeds with lower viability.</p><br/></p>

In the current study, we have standardized the optimum concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) solution media for efficient sterilization and rapid germination. We have tested various concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution as well as sterile water control (H<sub>2</sub>O, 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> or 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for sterilization and germination efficiency. All three steps of germination (seed sterilization, germination, and seedlings development) were carried out in various concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution and seeds were kept in liquid media for four days. Hydrogen peroxide presents several significant advantages over mercuric chloride or bleach sterilants, which require additional seed washing, and separate germination/seedling development step in Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar medium (Sorokin <em>et al.</em>, 2020). The 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution showed rapid and higher germination than higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations solution and water control at day 1 (Figure 1). On day 1, 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>solution exhibited 82.5% germination as compared to 22.5% germination for 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>group, 17.5% germination for 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>group and 47.5% germination in water control group (Figure 1B). Interestingly, 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>did not show any germination on day 1 due to its toxic effect (Figure 1). In 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>solution, radicle appearance (germination) occurred within 24 h and seedling development (two fully developed cotyledons and two immature true leaves stage) occurred in 72-96 h (Figure 1A). In comparison to previous germination methods which take between 4-7 days for radicle appearance and 5-15 days for seedling development (Wielgus <em>et al.</em>, 2008 and references therein), our germination method resulted in radicle appearance in 1 day and allowed us to obtain cannabis seedlings in a very short period (3-7 days) with minimal efforts (Figures 1-2). Considering the possible toxic effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(since germinated seeds/seedlings stayed continuously in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution for 4 days), we have checked further survival of germinated seeds/seedlings on MS media and soil (Figures 2-3). On MS media, 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution seedlings survived better than other treatments (Figure 2). The water germinated seeds exhibited contamination and did not survive on MS media (Figure 2). Similarly, due to the toxic effect of higher concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>germinated seeds did not survive on MS media (Figure 2). The 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution seedlings also survived well on soil (Figure 3). Apart from this, we have also tested our method for more than 5-years old cannabis seeds with lower viability, which demonstrated that 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>solution medium exhibited a very high germination percentage (~50%) as compared to water control (~10%) (Figure 4). In conclusion, we have developed a rapid and efficient method for <em>C. sativa</em> seed germination under sterile conditions for tissue culture and other sensitive applications.</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3875/bioprotoc-11-01-3875-g001.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.
