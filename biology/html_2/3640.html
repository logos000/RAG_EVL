            <h1>Isolation and High Throughput Flow Cytometric Apoptosis Assay of Human Neutrophils to Enable Compound Library Screening</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> K. D. Herman, A. Rahman, L. R. Prince</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The study of human neutrophils <em>in vitro</em> is challenging due to their short half-life and propensity for activation. However, with careful handling and manipulation in the laboratory, they can be a powerful tool to investigate immune responses in health and disease. Here we describe a method for the isolation of human neutrophils from peripheral blood samples, followed by a high-throughput screen to assess the efficacy of a library of compounds in inducing neutrophil apoptosis, which may have therapeutic potential in neutrophil-driven diseases. This protocol is based on previously-published neutrophil isolation methods utilizing Dextran sedimentation of red blood cells followed by the separation of granulocytes with plasma/Percoll discontinuous gradient centrifugation. Yields of ~1 x 10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils per millilitre of blood, and purities of &gt; 95% neutrophils are typical. Neutrophils are treated with a library of kinase inhibitors, followed by flow cytometry to assess the rate of neutrophil apoptosis. This protocol allows for the high-throughput screening of primary human immune cells to identify compounds with a potential to modify neutrophil function, and could be modified to assess other phenotypes if required.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Neutrophils are important innate immune cells with keys roles in defense against infection. They are short-lived cells with a typical half-life in the circulation of 6-8h which is extended at sites of infection and inflammation (Summers <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Hidalgo <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Although this allows neutrophils to complete critical effector functions, a failure to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) leads to the release of neutrophil contents that are histotoxic and ultimately perpetuates tissue damage and inflammation. Neutrophil apoptosis is anti-inflammatory, both by removing effete neutrophils from the tissue and promotion of their clearance by macrophages (efferocytosis). The precise regulation of neutrophil apoptosis is therefore critical and if therapeutically targeted may provide a route into novel medicines for inflammatory diseases in which neutrophils predominate. A number of studies highlight the importance of protein kinases in regulating neutrophil apoptosis (Webb <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Rossi <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Burgon <em>et al.</em>, 2014) and a number of small molecule inhibitors are in development (Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Here we have screened a library of kinase inhibitors in a high-throughput flow cytometric assay to identify novel regulators of neutrophil apoptosis.<br/> <br/>In this protocol, neutrophils are isolated from human blood by dextran sedimentation and discontinuous plasma/Percoll gradient centrifugation, based on previous protocols (Haslett <em>et al.</em>, 1985). Neutrophils are extremely sensitive to activation, particularly with respect to rates of cell death, so minor modifications have been made in order to minimize handling and activation of cells. We have developed a flow cytometric assay using the Attune Autosampler to allow us to screen compound libraries in a fast and efficient way, using Annexin-V and TOPRO-3 as markers of apoptosis. Testing up to 88 compounds in a single experiment minimizes prep-to-prep variation, including technical and donor variation and allows experimental repeats to be completed in a timely manner.</p>

Avoid disturbing the interface.</li><li>Centrifuge the PRP at 896 <em>x g</em> for 20 min at 20 Â°C (Figure 1, Spin 2) to pellet the platelets. Following centrifugation of the PRP, transfer the supernatant (PPP, Figure 1B) to a fresh 50 ml tube. The platelet pellet can be discarded.</li><li>During this centrifugation step, add 6 ml of the pre-warmed 6% dextran solution to the remaining blood cell layer from Step C1, and top up to 50 ml with saline.

Informed consent was obtained from all donors after the nature and possible consequences of the study were explained.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti37476">### References</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Burgon, J., Robertson, A.
