            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In glomerular diseases, podocytes are one type of cells involved in dysfunction of glomerular filtration. In these conditions, podocyte proteins expression change. Therefore, immunofluorescent staining of podocytes can be performed to visualize podocyte localization of proteins of interest. In this protocol, we detail a method to stain podocytes with a specific marker WT-1 (<em>Wilms Tumor-1</em>) for â<em>in situ</em>â podocyte analysis by immunofluorescent microscopy, more informative technique than other techniques (as Western blot).</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><em>In vivo</em>, mature podocytes are glomerular epithelial cells that are normally terminally differentiated (Pavenstadt <em>et al.</em>, 2003). Under pathological conditions, podocytes may undergo mitosis and proliferate. For example, crescentic glomerulonephritis is an exceptional condition where podocytes undergo a dysregulation of their differentiated phenotype and start to proliferate and migrate, resulting in the so-called extracapillary glomerulopathy. Several studies have shown involvement of podocytes in crescentic glomerulonephritis (Moeller <em>et al.</em>, 2004). <br/><br/>Wilmâs tumor 1 (WT-1) is a zinc finger transcription factor present in nucleus of podocyte. Podocalyxin is a sialoglycoprotein constituting the glycocalyx of podocytes and endothelial cells in glomerulus. The expression of WT1 and podocalyxin are not decreased in early-stage of glomerular damage compared to proteins of slit diaphragm as podocin or nephrin. Moreover, WT1 is useful to evaluating podocyte number and density under different circumstances. The advantages to use podocalyxin staining are i) to analyze the glomerular morphology, ii) to quantify flocculus area to perform WT1+ cells / flocculus area ratio; iii) to ensure that WT1+ cells are podocytes and no other cells as parietal epithelial cells which could express WT1 in pathophysiological context. <br/><br/>Our protocol can be used in crescentic glomerulonephritis (Henique <em>et al.</em>, 2017) but also in studies on different glomerulopathies as hypertensive nephropathy.<br/></p>
