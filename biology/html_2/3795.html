            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Aphids are a serious pest of crops across the world. Aphids feed by inserting their flexible hypodermal needlelike mouthparts, or stylets, into their host plant tissues. They navigate their way to the phloem where they feed on its sap causing little mechanical damage to the plant. Additionally, while feeding, aphids secrete proteinaceous effectors in their saliva to alter plant metabolism and disrupt plant defenses to gain an advantage over the plant. Even with these arsenals to overcome plant responses, plants have evolved ways to detect and counter with defense responses to curtail aphid infestation. One of such response of cowpea to cowpea aphid infestation, is accumulation of the metabolite methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal is an Î±,Î²-dicarbonyl ketoaldehyde that is toxic at high concentrations. Methylglyoxal levels increase modestly after exposure to a number of different abiotic and biotic stresses and has been shown to act as an emerging defense signaling molecule at low levels. Here we describe a protocol to measure methylglyoxal in cowpea leaves after cowpea aphid infestation, by utilizing a perchloric acid extraction process. The extracted supernatant was neutralized with potassium carbonate, and methylglyoxal was quantified through its reaction with N-acetyl-L-cysteine to form N-Î±-acetyl-S-(1-hydroxy-2-oxo-prop-1-yl)cysteine, a product that is quantified spectrophotometrically.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The importance of methylglyoxal in plant response and signaling to various stresses is only just beginning to be understood. Various abiotic stresses have been shown to lead to an accumulation of methylglyoxal in plants (Yadav <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Borysiuk <em>et al.</em>, 2018). This accumulation suggests that methylglyoxal has a signaling role in plants (Hossain <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Hoque <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Mostofa <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Exogenous application of methylglyoxal has been found to upregulate antioxidant and defense genes in plants corroborating the role methylglyoxal has as a signaling molecule (Kaur <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Li <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The accumulation of methylglyoxal in plants has also been described in response to biotic stresses including bacterial, viral and fungal infections (Melvin <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Recently, it has been shown that cowpea aphid infestation also leads to an increase in methylglyoxal level expanding its role in defense against herbivore pests (MacWilliams <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Three methods have been established for quantification of methylglyoxal. Of these three methods, the N-acetyl-L-cysteine method by Wild <em>et al.</em> (2012) has been found to measure methylglyoxal in the most economical and safest way. The other two methods involve expensive enzyme purification or derivatization with an explosive chemical (Racker, 1951; Gilbert and Brandt, 1975). N-acetyl-L-cysteine method involves mixing methylglyoxal with N-acetyl-L-cysteine to generate N-Î±-acetyl-S-(1-hydroxy-2-oxo-prop-1-yl)cysteine which is detected and measured at absorbance 288 nm by a spectrophotometer (Figure 1). In this protocol, we combine the method by Wild <em>et al.</em> (2012), that simply measures methylglyoxal levels, with extraction of methylglyoxal from plant tissues, and measuring its levels in cowpea (<em>Vigna unguiculata</em>) leaves after cowpea aphid infestation (<em>Aphis craccivora</em>).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201013/20201013020223_0193.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.
