            <h1>Intestinal Enteroid Culture for Human Astroviruses</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Irene A. Owusu, Carmen Mirabelli, Abimbola O. Kolawole</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Human astroviruses (HAstV) are non-enveloped, positive-sense single stranded RNA viruses that typically cause gastroenteritis in children, the elderly and among immunocompromised individuals. Some HAstV species have also been implicated in neurological diseases. It is important to study these viruses to understand the pathogenesis and develop therapeutics. Here we describe HAstV infection in epithelium-only human intestinal enteroids (HIE) isolated from biopsy-derived intestinal crypts. Although different HAstV clades have been propagated in transformed immortalized cell lines such as A549, Caco-2, HEK293T and Huh7.5, we chose HIE because they better mimic the human intestine and thus are more physiologically relevant. Additionally, HIE support the replication of all HAstV clades including clinical samples, thus making HIE a valuable potential universal model to study HAstV biology.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Human astroviruses (HAstV) are enteric viruses that are highly prevalent, causing widespread infections ranging from diarrhea to encephalitis. Asymptomatic, systemic and extra-intestinal infections are common (Madeley and Cosgrove 1975; Bosch <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Kolawole <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Despite their medical importance, HAstV are some of the least characterized enteric viruses. Currently, three groups of human AstV are recognized: classic HAstV, and non-classic HAstV-MLB (Melbourne), and HAstV-VA/HMO (Virginia/Human-Mink-Ovine-like) with each group containing multiple strains. Several immortalized cell lines have been developed for successful propagation of multiple HAstV strains. Human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells are commonly used to propagate all eight serotypes of classic HAstV. As for the non-classic HAstV, Caco-2 cells, human embryonic kidney HEK293T, adeno-carcinomic human lung epithelial A549, and primary astrocytes were only recently described to support VA1 propagation (Janowski <em>et al.</em>, 2017 and 2019). In addition, A549 and human liver Huh7 were developed to propagate MLB1 and MLB2 (Vu <em>et al.</em>, 2019). However, no single culture system supports the replication of all tested species. The lack of a robust, physiologically relevant viral propagation system for genetically diverse viruses from all clades has created a fundamental gap in our understanding about the biology of HAstV. For example, little or no information is available on the <em>in vivo</em> cell tropism, pathophysiology, and host responses to HAstV infection.<br/> <br/>Human intestinal enteroids (HIE) are nontransformed <em>in vitro</em> models that recapitulate many characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract. HIE are derived from <em>stem cells</em> isolated from human intestinal biopsy tissues or surgical resections. Thus, this system exhibits multiple advantages over traditional transformed intestinal cell lines (<em>e.g.</em>, Caco-2 cells). These include the non-transformed status, the presence of multiple cell types, the specific regional characteristics and host genetics of the donor and the ability to differentiate from crypt-like into villus-like cell populations (Kolawole <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Kolawole and Wobus, 2020). There are some drawbacks involved with using HIE. Examples include donor-to-donor variability, inability of HIE to completely mimic the cellularity of the intestine <em>in vivo</em> and the major investment needed for culture maintenance. However, HIE have been used to culture human rotavirus, norovirus and astrovirus by breaking apart the 3D spheres in which they are normally organized in culture (Figure 1, left) and seeding as 2D monolayer (Figure 1, right) (Kolawole and Wobus, 2020). Here, we describe our methods of HIE maintenance and AstV infection. Laboratory adapted samples of HAstV1, MLB1 and VA1 represented HAstV clades that were propagated in HIE. HAstV5-positive stool sample was also used to propagate clinical HAstV in HIE. All infections were performed in 2D monolayers. These protocols, with the required specific adjustments, should facilitate the study of HAstV and other enteric viruses.</p>

Representative flow graph of total cell population that was alive (mock, black; VA1 infected, blue).<br/></li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34763">### Recipes</p><p class="ppzz"><strong><em>Working Environment</em></strong> </p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><em>All preparations and procedures must be done under the sterile conditions of a biosafety hood.</em> </li><li><em>Appropriate personal protective equipment must be worn.</em> </li><li><em>Transfer all waste into a biohazard bag in the biosafety hood.
