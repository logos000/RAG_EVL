            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is a well-established chemical mediator for the generation of the fever at the hypothalamus of the brain. PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates fever generation via PGE receptor 3 (<em>i.e.</em>, EP3) on neurons in the preoptic area. The role of PGE<sub>2</sub> has been analyzed by measuring PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (C<sub>csf</sub>); however, local PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration at the hypothalamus may not necessarily be consistent with C<sub>csf</sub>. In this protocol, we introduce our method to measure directly the alteration in PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in interstitial fluid in the hypothalamus (C<sub>isf</sub>) of awake (free-moving) mice using a microdialysis technique. Male mice (c57BL/6J) were anesthetized and fixed in the stereotaxic instrument, and a microdialysis probe was inserted into the hypothalamus through a guide cannula. On the fifth postoperative day, C<sub>isf</sub> was monitored in free-moving mice that were intraperitoneally (<em>i.p.</em>) injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). PGE<sub>2</sub> and other eicosanoids recovered in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer and defused through a microdialysis probe were extracted into ethyl acetate/formic acid and then quantified with LC-MS/MS. Our method is useful to understand the role of key regulators of prostaglandin concentration such as those of transporters, which have been unappreciated in inflammation-based brain diseases.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>PGE<sub>2</sub> is intracellularly synthesized by cyclooxygenase pathways and released into extracellular spaces, where it binds to PGE receptors (<em>i.e.</em>, EP1-4) to exhibit its activity. Prostanoids such as PGE<sub>2</sub> are present in an anionic form under physiological conditions, and membrane transport has been suggested to be important for the local distribution and physiological action of PGE<sub>2</sub> (Schuster, 2012; Nakanishi and Tamai, 2018). To date, several carrier proteins that are involved in PGE<sub>2</sub> membrane transport have been identified and characterized; however, their roles in PGE<sub>2</sub> distribution are not fully understood, particularly in the brain. Among these, organic anion transporting polypeptide 2A1 (OATP2A1) encoded by <em>SLCO2A1</em> is a membrane transporter responsible for cellular uptake of prostanoids including PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGD<sub>2</sub>, and PGF<sub>2</sub>Î±, which are important for inflammatory reactions and homeostasis (Kanai <em>et al.</em>, 1995). The roles of OATP2A1 in PGE<sub>2</sub> disposition have been analyzed in <em>SLCO2A1</em>-deficient (<em>SLCO2A1</em>-/-) mice (Chang <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Nakanishi <em>et al.</em>, 2015). More recently, we reported that OATP2A1 located in intracellular organelles was involved in exocytotic PGE<sub>2</sub> secretion from certain types of cells including macrophages (Shimada <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Some previous articles described a potential role of OATP2A1 in the febrile response (Ivanov <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Ivanov and Romanovsky, 2004). Indeed, OATP2A1 is expressed at the apical membranes of the choroid plexus (Tachikawa <em>et al.</em>, 2012) and subarachnoidal blood vessels in rodents (Hosotani <em>et al.</em>, 2015) and in primary cultured cerebral endothelial cells prepared from rats (Kis <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Furthermore, in patients with Alzheimerâs disease, immunoreactivity for anti-OATP2A1 antibody has been reported in some glial cells including microglia and astrocytes (Choi <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Therefore, our laboratory performed microdialysis to measure alteration in C<sub>isf</sub> (concentration in interstitial fluid) of PGE<sub>2</sub> at the hypothalamus of the brain to understand the physiological significance of OATP2A1 in LPS-induced fever generation. Our recent study determined C<sub>isf</sub> of PGE<sub>2</sub> at the hypothalamus in LPS-treated <em>SLCO2A1</em><sup>+/+</sup> and <em>SLCO2A1</em><sup>-/-</sup> mice and clearly demonstrated that it was neither identical to C<sub>csf</sub> nor its concentration in hypothalamic tissues (C<sub>hyp</sub>) and was maintained by OATP2A1 independently (Nakamura <em><em>et al.</em></em>, 2018). As far as we know, there is no report showing C<sub>isf</sub> of PGE<sub>2</sub> measured in free-moving small mammals like mice, although it has been analyzed by a microdialysis technique in rats (Gerozissis <em><em>et al.</em></em>, 1995), rabbits (Kao, T. Y. <em><em>et al.</em></em>, 2007; Kao, C. H. <em><em>et al.</em></em>, 2007), and guinea pigs (Sehic <em><em>et al.</em></em>, 1996). In the case of small animals such as mice, C<sub>isf</sub> of PGE<sub>2</sub> is expected to be lower than the detection limit of enzyme immunoassays, although an immunoassay is the most convenient and prevalent way to determine prostanoid concentration (Pradelles <em><em>et al.</em></em>, 1985). However, protanoids can be easily detected using LC-MS/MS when extracted from biological fluids and concentrated using a solid phase column because accurate and sensitive quantification methods for prostanoids are established with LC-MS/MS (Schmidt <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Cao <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Fine microdialysis techniques to measure alteration in prostanoid concentration in the extracellular spaces of the brain in mouse models have been used widely in the field of neuroscience to promote an understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation. Therefore, in this article, we present our protocols for analysis of PGE<sub>2</sub> in microdialysis samples collected from the hypothalamus of mice, where PGE<sub>2</sub> functions as a chemical mediator for fever generation.</p>

gauge of needle x 12.7 mm, 0.5-ml). Tilt the mouse with its head slightly toward the ground, and insert the needle at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen and to a depth in which 1/2 of the needle length is placed in the peritoneal cavity. Use caution to avoid injection of the intestinal organs and urinary bladder.</li><li>Attach a guide cannula to a manipulator of the stereotaxic instrument in the vertical plane (Figure 1).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731000356_2523.jpg" width="132"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

Alternatively, you can shave the scalp, although this is not necessary for the following operation.</li><li>Remove the scalp at the top of the head around the bregma with scissors in a circle of at most 3 mm in diameter so that the skull becomes visible.</li><li>Carefully remove the periosteum and aponeurosis covering the skull using tweezers and scissors until the film disappears.</li><li>Wipe the skull with cotton wool, and let the surface dry for about 10 min.</li><li>The bregma is difficult to visualize when the surface is wet. Until the bregma appears, make a hole of approximately 1 mm in diameter in the posterior part of the exposed skull using a dental drill to attach an anchor screw to fasten the guide cannula. The screw should be attached near the guide cannula to be set. </li><li>Move the manipulator just as the tip of the guide cannula comes over the bregma (Figure 2), and then record the vertical and horizontal tick marks of the stereotaxic instrument.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731000424_1078.jpg" width="161"/><br/><strong>Figure 2. Setting the tip of the guide cannula onto the bregma of the skull.</strong> The photo represents the tip of a guide cannula on the bregma.<br/><br/></li><li>Move the tip of the guide cannula from the bregma, 0.9 mm forward, 0.1 mm right, and mark the position with oil-based ink. To drill a hole at the position, the guide cannula needs to be detached; therefore, it is recommended that the position set is marked with an oil-based ink before the cannula is removed.</li><li>Use a dental drill to make a hole of about 1 mm in diameter at the marked point.</li><li>Move the cannula down, touch it to the surface of the brain (at the level of the dura mater), and read the scale of the depth.</li><li>Move the cannula further down slowly to a depth of 4.0 mm from the surface. This operation usually takes at least 1 min. Wipe the blood off with absorbent cotton when the surgical area bleeds during the operation. If bleeding does not stop, keep cotton where the blood is coming out from until it stops. If the mice bleed by more than a tenth of whole blood, usually estimated as 1/13 of the body weight, discontinuation of the operation should be considered.</li><li>Fasten the cannula to the skull with instant adhesive temporarily.</li><li>When the instant adhesive hardens, use dental cement to seal the gap between the guide cannula and the skull.</li><li>When the cement is set, detach the cannula from the manipulator.</li><li>Using a precision screwdriver, attach an anchor screw to the hole made in Step A8.</li><li>Coat the skull and anchor screw firmly with dental cement, and then fasten the cannula with the anchor screw. Please make sure the guide cannula cannot be moved; it may come off or move when the mouse moves freely, resulting in inaccurate measurements.</li><li>Once the cement is dry, apply woodworking glue to cover the surface of the cement. It usually takes approximately 10 and 5 min for the cement and glue to harden, respectively.</li><li>When the glue has hardened, release the mouse to its cage.</li><li>The next day, anesthetize the mice with pentobarbital and use tweezers to pull off the dummy probe that was inserted inside the guide cannula.</li><li>Insert a fresh microdialysis probe, and fix it with dental cement. Before insertion, rinse the probe according to the manufacturerâs instruction. In our case, the tip of the probe was dipped in 70% EtOH solution and infused with KRPB for 5 min at a flow rate of 10 Î¼l/min. Then, the tip of the probe was transferred into KRPB and infused with KRPB for another 5 min at the same flow rate. Probes were usually prepared on the day of use.</li><li>Keep the mice in their cages for another 5 days to recover from postoperative damage. If the mice lose body weight of 25% or more after the operation, the experiment is not recommended due to severe damage to the brain.</li><li>Attach the mouse to a free-moving device, transfer it to an acrylic cage, and infuse KRPB at a flow rate of 2 Î¼l/min. The dialysate sample should be collected every hour in 0.6-ml microtubes kept on ice (Video 1).<br/><br/><!--video3324-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3324-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3324-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3324/3324-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.
