            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Paper nanobiosensors have been established as an excellent platform for analysis of veterinary and human pathogens causing various diseases. Especially, lateral flow assays or biosensors ideal for sensitive, rapid, robust and accurate analysis in laboratory setups and on-site analysis. Viral RNA detection is of great importance for public health as well as animal health protection. In that aspect, the present protocol focuses on the development of functionalized gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor for fish nervous necrosis virus (Nodavirus) nucleic acids detection. Total viral RNA, isolated from fish samples was subjected to reverse transcription PCR amplification and the amplification products were mixed with specific oligonucleotide probe. A red test line was formed when nodavirus product was present. The proposed assay has great implications on basic research since it eliminates the need for time-consuming, cumbersome electrophoresis protocols and could be adjusted for use on the site of fish culture by fish farmers. Disease monitoring by such bioanalytical platforms without time consuming and costly procedures would have great impact on the aquaculture and environmental safety.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Point-of-care and/or on-site bioanalysis has been the ultimate goal of research efforts focusing on the well being of humans and animals. Sensing platforms based on paper substrates are very attractive as analytical platforms because they are functionalized easily, with great reproducibility and low fabrication costs. Paper-based analytical devices have been applied on the analysis of small molecules, proteins and all kinds of nucleic acids (Parolo and MerkoÃ§i, 2013; Bahadir and SezgintÃ¼rk, 2016; Jiang <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Lateral flow biosensors (LFBs) are prefabricated strips of materials with dry reagents and they are activated by fluid samples. They are designed for disposable single use where an on/off signal is sufficient (Posthuma-Trumpie <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Lateral flow nanobiosensors incorporate nanoparticles and are optimal for rapid analysis in research laboratories, along with their potential for use on point-of-care. Gold nanoparticles, with size smaller than 100 nm, are mainly used as LFB labels due to their unique optical properties, <em>i.e.</em>, vivid red color, easy surface functionalization with a variety of biomolecules, intense optical signal, high surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional chemical stability (Cheng <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Posthuma-Trumpie <em>et al.</em>, 2009).<br/><br/>In that frame, our research efforts are focused on the development of gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensors for virus assessment. The present protocol was developed for fish nervous necrosis virus or nodavirus nucleic acids detection (Toubanaki <em>et al.</em>, 2015), in order to increase the detection accuracy, simplify and speed up the total time of PCR-based analysis. In brief, total viral RNA, isolated from fish samples was subjected to reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) amplification. The PCR products were mixed with specific oligonucleotide probe and applied next to oligonucleotide conjugated gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). A red test line was formed when nodavirus product was present. The visual detection of the RT-PCR product was completed within 20 min. The present detection platform has been utilized in other pathogens detection (<em>e.g.</em>, hepatitis C virus [Glynou <em>et al.</em>, 2003]; bacterial infections [Kalogianni <em>et al.</em>, 2007]; Leishmania parasite DNA [Toubanaki <em>et al.</em>, 2016]) and could be adjusted for other pathogens detection with proper primers and probe design.</p>
