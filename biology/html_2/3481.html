            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Play is a complex social behavior that is highly conserved across mammals. In most species, males engage in more frequent and vigorous play as juveniles than females, which reflects subtle yet impactful sex differences in brain circuitry and development. In this protocol, we describe a behavioral testing paradigm to assess social play in male and female juvenile rats. We highlight the behavior scoring criteria for distinguishing rough-and-tumble play from other play-related social behaviors. By analyzing both sexes, play behavior can be leveraged as a powerful tool to understand the sex-specific development and expression of social behavior.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Play is a highly conserved social behavior expressed by juveniles in several mammalian species, from rodents to humans (Auger and Olesen, 2009). Play is highly complex, involving dynamic interactions between conspecifics and is necessary for the development of appropriate social, cognitive, and affective behaviors later in life (Van den Berg <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Von Frijtag <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Baarendse <em>et al.</em>, 2013). In many species, males engage in more frequent and vigorous play, called rough-and-tumble play or play fighting. This sex difference in behavior is developmentally programmed and is the result of sexual differentiation of the brain (Auger and Olesen, 2009; Thornton <em>et al.</em>, 2009).<br/><br/>Here we describe a protocol to assess juvenile play using male and female rats. Each day throughout the juvenile period, rats are paired with an age-, sex-, and treatment-matched partner and play behavior is analyzed. In this way, this protocol is used to assess sex differences in baseline or ânaturalisticâ play. When combined with early-life pharmacological or genetic manipulation, this protocol can be used to study the processes of brain sexual differentiation and the development of social behavior circuitry (Vanderschuren <em>et al.</em>, 2016; VanRyzin <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Alternatively, the protocol can be performed as a single-trial to study sex differences in the activation of neural circuitry underlying play (Veenema <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Bredewold <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p>

These âplay pairsâ will remain constant across multiple days of testing such that each animal is playing with the same play partner every day. To achieve this, we plan experiments to include rats from at least two separate litters.

Using a smart phone camera, we are able to record 4 arenas simultaneously with sufficient detail and resolution. See Figure 2B.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191225/20191225235101_1986.jpg" width="280"/><br/><strong>Figure 2. Testing arena and set up.</strong> A. Image of a single behavior testing arena. B. Image of four testing arenas arranged in front of a tripod for video recording.<br/><br/></li><li>Fill each testing arena with enough TEK-fresh bedding to cover the bottom of the arena (approximately 2-3 cm deep).</li><li>Plan play pairs and the order of behavioral testing. The order of testing needs to be changed each day to counterbalance the time of testing for each group across all test days.</li></ol></li><li>On the day of testing, move the animals (in their home cage) from the colony room into the behavioral testing room to allow them to habituate to the experimental environment (approx. 20 min prior to testing and at least 1 h after the start of the dark cycle). Testing during the dark phase (the active phase for the rat) is essential for proper behavioral analysis.</li><li>Mark one of the animals in each play pair either with a fur-marking pen (on the head or back) or by striping the tail with a permanent marker. This facilitates behavioral analysis as it is easier to attribute specific behaviors to the marked or unmarked animal.</li><li>Once the animals have habituated, place an animal pair into the testing arena and allow the animals to acclimate to the arena for 2 min.</li><li>After acclimation, record behavior for 10 min.</li><li>Once the test has concluded, stop the recording. Remove the animals from the testing arena and place them back in their home cage.</li><li>Repeat Steps 4-6 as many times as needed until all animals have been tested.</li><li>On subsequent days, repeat Steps 2-7. We typically perform the test for 4 continuous days (P27-30) to capture the peak sex difference in play behavior; however, the test can be repeated each day throughout the entire juvenile period (approximately P26-35).</li></ol><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>During the test, the experimenter should remain behind a curtain or out of sight of the testing arenas. Additionally, maintain quiet in the room as external noises may disrupt behavior.</em> </li><li><em>It is not necessary to clean the testing arena or change the bedding between trials. At the conclusion of each test day, the arena should be cleaned (using a cleaner of the experimenterâs choosing) and bedding replaced in preparation for the next day.</em> </li><li><em>Be sure to keep the red light intensity to a minimum to avoid creating an artificially stressful testing environment. The lighting for our behavior testing is typically &lt; 50 lux. Additionally, red light should be used for Sprague Dawley rats as they are albino and their inability to see red light keeps the testing environment as close to a natural dark phase as possible for optimal behavior testing.</em> </li><li><em>While rats do emit ultrasonic vocalizations during play, this does not impact the expression of play (Kisko </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2015), and does not confound testing more than 1 pair of animals at a time.</em> </li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30795">### Data analysis</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Behavior is scored offline by an experimenter blind to the sex and treatment of the animals.<br/><em>Note: Scoring may be done by hand or by using keylogger software.</em> </li><li>The animal performing a given behavior receives a score for that behavior. Thus, one play pair yields two data points. This helps improve interpretability of the data, as high- and low-playing animals will not be averaged with their play partnerâs behavior. Moreover, scoring behavior for each animal allows for an analysis of each individual animal over time to get an average play value across all test days.</li><li>To assess rough-and-tumble play behavior, we score the following behaviors (see Videos 1-3 and Figure 1B):<ol class="npwthree"><li>PouncingâScored when one animal launches itself toward the otherâs nape or back. This is often a vigorous motion and is scored to the animal performing the pounce.<br/><em>Note: Animals may forcefully bump into each other or perform âlow effortâ pounces. These are generally not scored as the intent to initiate play is much more ambiguous.</em> </li><li>PinningâScored when a pouncing animal flips the other completely onto its back (all four limbs off the ground). A pin is scored to the pouncing animal, and often will be scored directly after a pounce.<br/><em>Note: Pinning is often the result of the animal that is being pounced on continuing the play bout by rolling onto their back in a defensive position. However, the animal may flip over onto its side, keeping weight on their feet. In these cases, a pin is not scored.</em> </li><li>BoxingâScored when both animals rear up on their hind legs and paw at each other. Both animals receive a score for boxing.<br/><em>Note: Boxing is much less frequent than either pouncing or pinning and is observed often following bouts of chasing, when the animal being chased turns and confronts the chaser.</em><br/><br/><!--video3481-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3481-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3481-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3481/3481-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.

In general, we have never found baseline activity differences between males and females, but experimental manipulations may affect this.</li><li>Filling the testing arena with too much bedding can lead to a decrease in social behavior and an increase in environmental exploration, as the animals will begin to burrow under the bedding.</li><li>We test animals on a reverse light:dark cycle and begin behavioral testing 1-2 h after the onset of the dark cycle. It is important to keep the timing of behavioral analysis consistent across days to avoid any circadian influences on behavior.</li><li>Depending on the number of test days, age of the animals, and pharmacological manipulations, animals may begin to display sex behavior at the onset of puberty (approximately P40 in our colony). We do not score sex behavior as a social behavior in this paradigm, as it occurs very rarely in our experience; however, if it is occurring frequently, it can be analyzed as a separate set of behaviors to determine if puberty has occurred early.</li><li>Male and female play behavior is expressed along a continuum from high to low play. While males, on average, are on the âhighâ end of the continuum relative to females, there is a fair amount of natural individual variability. Each cohort of animals will likely have a few high-playing females and low-playing males. This natural behavioral variability is not a reason to exclude these animals from analysis; rather, plan experiments with a sufficient sample size to account for this. We recommend at least 8 animals per sex.</li><li>Play pairs should be same-sex, same-treatment. Mixing sexes or treatments within a given play pair may result in an intermediate play phenotype (<em>i.e.</em>, a more playful partner will increase a low playing rats play and vice versa). See Argue and McCarthy, 2015 for an example.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30797">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health R01MH52716 and R01DA039062 to M.M.M.This protocol was adapted from Argue and McCarthy, 2015, and Vanryzin <em>et al.</em>, 2019.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30798">### Competing interests</p><p class="ppzz">The authors have no competing interests to declare.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30799">### Ethics</p><p class="ppzz">All animal procedures described here are performed in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committeeâs regulations at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (Protocol # 0517007, 06/30/20).</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30800">### References</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Argue, K.
