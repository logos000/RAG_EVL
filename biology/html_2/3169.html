            <h1>Determination of Cellular Uptake and Endocytic Pathways</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Jing Gong, Hong-Xia Wang, Kam W. Leong</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Efficiency of drug and gene delivery via nonviral vehicles is contingent on proper cellular uptake and intracellular release. Further, various cargos, such as nucleases for gene editing or inhibitors for endosomal receptors, require transport to specific compartments of the cell. Hence, characterization of cellular uptake and endocytic pathways is crucial for the optimization of any nanoparticle-mediated intracellular delivery system. Previous work on endocytic pathways looks at the effect of various pathway inhibitors on the uptake efficiency of nanoparticles carrying fluorescently-labeled cargo. While this helps attribute particle uptake to specific pathways like caveolae-mediated or clathrin-mediated endocytosis, this does not provide a holistic picture of the delivery process. Here, we provide a general protocol that combines systematic studies of inhibitor effects on efficiency with quantification of particle-induced cell membrane permeability. By applying this methodology to a nucleic acid delivery system, for example a helical polypeptide-based nanoparticle for plasmid and guide RNA delivery, we gain understanding of the endocytic mechanisms and cell uptake for intelligent design of intracellular delivery.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>While nonviral delivery has made significant progress over the past decade, from the initial inert nanoparticle design to biofunctional and ligand-targeting nanocarriers with improved delivery efficiency, these novel delivery vehicle systems still lack viral deliveryâs high transduction efficiency. Because of this inadequacy, a large portion of research has been dedicated to determining the limiting factors restricting nonviral delivery through mapping the cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of delivery vehicles. Further, in the field of nucleic acid therapeutics, where the success of nanoparticle delivery is measured through a secondary mechanism such as gene-cleavage detection or quantitative PCR, developing an analytical platform to resolve and quantify vehicle uptake, intracellular trafficking and endosomal escape is crucial. Previous work applies fluorescently-tagged nanoparticles, fluorescent protein gene expression and flow cytometry to explore uptake of the delivery vehicle as a whole (Dausend <em>et al.</em>, 2008). More recently, researchers investigated cellular trafficking by employing image-based analysis for colocalization of fluorescently-tagged vehicles with lysotracker and application of uptake pathway inhibitors (Gilleron <em>et al.</em>, 2013). This protocol builds on this breadth of research, to provide a robust method (Figure 1) to characterize the specific uptake and trafficking characteristics of any nucleic acid therapeutic in a nonviral delivery system (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2018). By the characterization of the intracellular transport of the therapeutic load, regardless of nanoparticle size, charge, material, and target cell type, the field can begin to pinpoint the weaknesses in nonviral genetic delivery and improve upon them (Iversen <em>et al.</em>, 2011). As a broader spectrum of cell types and delivery vehicles are interrogated using this protocol, various genetic and alternative therapeutic cargos can be delivered through intelligently designed vehicles for optimized on-target effects (Douglas <em>et al.</em>, 2008).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="108" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190215/20190215014210_8502.jpg" width="280"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.
