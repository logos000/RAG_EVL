            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Bacteria are surrounded by a protective peptidoglycan cell wall. Provided that this structure and the enzymes involved are the preferred target for our most successful antibiotics, determining its structural and chemical complexity is of the highest interest. Traditionally, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses have been performed, but these methods are very time consuming in terms of sample preparation and chromatographic separation. Here we describe an optimized method for preparation of Gram-negative bacteria peptidoglycan and its subsequent analysis by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). The use of UPLC in peptidoglycan analyses provides a dramatic reduction of the sample volume and hands-on time required and, furthermore, permits in-line mass spectrometry (MS) of the UPLC resolved muropeptides, thus facilitating their identification. This method improves our capability to perform high throughput analysis to better understand the cell-wall biology.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Bacteria are surrounded by a peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall that, in addition to a structural role, conveys cell shape and protects bacteria from external damage, acting as a barrier against biological, chemical and physical stresses. The murein sacculus or PG is the major component of the cell wall. Gram-negative bacteria present a monolayer in the periplasmic space (Gan<em> et al</em>., 2008), while it constitutes a thick mesh work with several pilled and crosslinked layers in Gram-positive bacteria, (Pasquina-Lemonche<em> et al</em>., 2020). The cell wall is a three-dimensional meshwork of crosslinked glycan strands that encloses the cell body (Glauner <em>et al</em>., 1988; Typas <em>et al</em>., 2011; Egan <em>et al</em>., 2020). The canonical monomeric subunit consists of the disaccharide pentapeptide GlcNAc-(Î²1-4)-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-(Î³)-(di-amino acid)-D-Ala-D-Ala, where meso-diaminopimelic acid and L-lysine are the most prevalent di-amino acids (Glauner <em>et al.</em>, 1988; Vollmer <em>et al.</em>, 2008). These monomers are converted into linear polymers by means of MurNAc-(Î²1-4)-GlcNAc glycosidic bonds and can be crosslinked by peptide chains.<br/><br/>The cell wall is subject to various enzymatic modifications that affect the chemical properties of its subunits, their relative abundance, and the structure of the cell wall (Vollmer <em>et al</em>., 2008). A detailed knowledge of the muropeptide composition under particular conditions is key to understanding to what extent PG variations influence bacterial adaptation to environmental challenges, resistance to antibacterial agents, immune-modulatory activity and toxin release and signaling (Alvarez <em>et al</em>., 2014; Cava and de Pedro, 2014; Yadav <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Our method allows us to study the effect of genetic perturbations on cell-wall composition in a high-throughput manner. Furthermore, combining high-throughput PG analysis with genetic perturbations, we can explore the functions of different cell-wall-modifying enzymes. In fact, we have recently studied how class-A Penicillin-Binding Proteins (aPBPs) contribute to cell-wall integrity in <em>Escherichia coli </em>(Vigouroux<em> et a</em><em>l</em>., 2020). By combining PG analysis, morphology analysis and single-molecule tracking, we have demonstrated that the major aPBP PBP1b contributes to cell-wall integrity by repairing cell-wall defects, while the Rod complex governs rod-like cell shape.<br/><br/>Here we describe in detail the procedure for Gram-negative bacteria sacculi isolation, muramidase digestion and muropeptide separation by liquid chromatography. We also provide some general instructions on compositional and structural analysis. The isolation of PG relies on the insolubility of the sacculi in SDS, which allows a relatively easy method to obtain high amounts of PG, and on the availability of specific enzymes (muramidases or lysozymes) that split the MurNAc-(Î²1-4)-GlcNAc glycosidic bonds which hold the structure together and disassemble it into its individual subunits. The next step requires the use of sensitive and reliable methods that permit the resolution, identification and quantification of the different PG subunits. Since the 80âs, HPLC has been traditionally used for this purpose (Glauner <em>et</em> <em>al</em>., 1988). While this technology was a revolution at the time and revealed an unexpected complexity in PG structure and composition, it has been used essentially unchanged for more than 30 years. However, there are three critical limitations: i) the requirement for inorganic buffers, incompatible with mass spectrometry in-line analysis that would facilitate identification of subunits; ii) the very low sample through-put, which requires a few days for sample preparation and several hours of HPLC run time per sample; and iii) the requirement for large sample volumes (injection volumes of 100-500 Âµl), due to the relatively low sensitivity of the chromatographic systems. The introduction of UPLC replacing its predecessor HPLC permits to dramatically reduce sample size (100x), while increasing the speed (20x), without compromising the quality of the data. The new systems allow the use of new and improved materials for reverse phase chromatography, including stationary phases with a very small particle size (in the range of 2 Âµm) that withstand very high pressures, increasing resolution, speed and sensitivity, which are essential requisites for high throughput analysis.<br/><br/>We have developed a new transformative approach that circumvents the limitations of the already available methods (<em>e.g.</em>, Desmarais <em>et al.,</em> 2013; KÃ¼hner<em> et al</em>., 2014). Our protocol i) can be easily adapted for the more frequently available UPLC machines by anyone with a basic knowledge of UPLC techniques; ii) has cut down sample preparation and run times dramatically, allowing for the processing and analysis of large numbers of PG samples per day; iii) is MS-compatible, samples can be collected and subjected to MS analysis without prior desalting steps or can even be analyzed in MS-systems coupled to the UPLC for a faster muropeptide identification, thus revealing a much higher PG chemical complexity than previously anticipated (<em>i.e</em>., identification of minor muropeptides); iv) and requires much less of sample, which is particularly important for <em>in vivo</em> samples (low sample size amount).</p>

Spin down the samples 10 min and 150,000 <em>x g</em> using 3 ml polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes. Use 20 Â°C or higher since SDS precipitates at low temperature. Fill the tubes with 3 ml lysate. Make sure the rotor is properly balanced. After centrifugation, all soluble compounds will remain in the supernatant. The resulting pellet is usually transparent and hard to distinguish. It is recommended to mark one side of the tube and use this as reference to locate the pellet (Figure 1B).<br style="color:#666666;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13.3333px;text-align:justify;white-space:normal;"/><em>Note: If during the washes a white precipitate (likely insoluble KDS) is observed, use Tris HCl 100 mM pH 8.0 buffer instead of water.</em> </li><li>Carefully discard the supernatant with a vacuum pump without removing the pellet. Resuspend the pellet in 900 Âµl MilliQ water and check for the presence of SDS by assessing the production of bubbles. If needed, add 2 ml MilliQ water, mix and centrifuge again. Repeat this wash step until SDS is completely removed (no bubbles are formed after the pellet is resuspended in water, typically 2-4 washes).</li><li>To remove Braunâs lipoprotein or other PG-associated proteins, treat the washed sacculi with a protease. This step is optional, but highly recommended. Transfer the resuspended pellet (~900 Âµl) to 2 ml microtubes. Add 100 Âµl Tris HCl 1 M pH 8 buffer and 1 Âµl proteinase K 20 mg/ml. Incubate samples at 37 Â°C during 1 h. Stop the reaction by adding 110 Âµl SDS 10% (w/v) and boil for 5 min in water.<br style="color:#666666;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13.3333px;text-align:justify;white-space:normal;"/><em>Note: Proteinase K is a broad-spectrum serine protease used for removal of PG bound proteins such as Braunâs lipoprotein. The enzyme retains activity in SDS 1% (w/v). Some bacteria do not require Proteinase K treatment, but it is recommended for removal of other PG-associated proteins.Other proteases as chymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1) or trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) can also be used.</em> </li><li>Let the sample cool down before transferring to the ultracentrifuge tubes again. Wash the Proteinase K digested sacculi by adding 2 ml MilliQ water. Mix and ultracentrifuge as described before. Carefully discard the supernatant and, after total removal of SDS, resuspend the pellet in 50-100 Âµl digestion buffer. The final volume is critical, since soluble muropeptides will remain in the soluble fraction after the muramidase digestion. Washed sacculi should be stored at 4 Â°C to avoid degradation or contamination. Storing the samples at -20 Â°C is not recommended since sacculi can break due to freeze/thaw processes.<br/></li></ol><br/></li><li>Muramidase digestion<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Transfer resuspended sacculi (50-100 Âµl) to 1.5 ml microtubes.</li><li>Add 2 Âµl mutanolysin 1 mg/ml and let the reaction work 2-16 h at 37 Â°C.

Do not add any detergent to the sample.</li><li>Centrifuge 15 min at room temperature and 20,000 <em>x g</em> in a benchtop centrifuge and transfer the supernatant to new 1.5 ml microtubes. This supernatant contains the soluble muropeptides released by the mutanolysin (Figure 1B). These samples are very stable and can be stored at 4 or -20 Â°C.<br/></li></ol><br/></li><li>Sample reduction<br/><em>Note: Sample reduction is optional but highly recommended. Digestion with mutanolysin produces a terminal reducing NAM. Sample reduction avoids the different anomeric configurations and the consequent appearance of two to four peaks per muropeptide in the PG profile, as the NAM is reduced to muramitol. Perform this procedure in a laminar flow cabinet. If no reduction is performed, adjust the sample pH to 2.0-4.0 with diluted orthophosphoric acid instead (0.25%, v/v).</em><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Add borate buffer to the sample to adjust pH to 8.5-9.0. For a 100 Âµl reaction, 15-20 Âµl borate buffer are typically used. Check pH using indicator strips: take 0.5 Âµl sample and drop on the indicator strip. Check the color/pH on the reference table. Do not leave samples at high pH for too long, since it leads to alkaline Î²-elimination (Tipper, 1968).</li><li>Add 20 Âµl freshly prepared NaBH<sub>4</sub> 2 M and let the sample reduce at room temperature for 30 min. This reaction produces H<sub>2</sub> and bubbles are accumulated, do not close the tube lids to prevent gas accumulation.</li><li>Adjust sample pH to 2.0-4.0 with orthophosphoric acid 25% (v/v). Addition of the acid will cause a violent reaction and sudden bubble formation. First add 4 Âµl and check the pH with the appropriate indicator strip as indicated before. If needed, carefully add acid Âµl by Âµl to ensure the sample reaches the desired pH.</li><li>Spin the tubes for 1 min at maximum speed to ensure maximum sample recovery. Transfer the samples to a 96-well V-shaped-bottom microplate. Seal the plate using a pierceable adhesive seal. Samples can be stored long-term at -20 Â°C. Insoluble precipitates might form and if observed, filter the samples prior to injection in the UPLC.<br/></li></ol><br/></li><li>UPLC separation<br/><em>Note: settings will depend on the software, model and manufacturer of the UPLC. For muropeptide profiling, reverse-phase (RP) columns, typically C18-bonded silicas that are able to retain and separate medium-polar and non-polar metabolites provide a good separation pattern. For RPLC, maximum retention of analytes is ensured by loading samples onto the column using solvents of low eluotropic strength (i.e., composed mainly or entirely of water). Elution of retained metabolites is accomplished using a gradient of increasing acetonitrile content.</em><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Set the column temperature to 45 Â°C.</li><li>Prepare mobile phases and refill bottles A and B with organic buffer A [formic acid 0.1% (v/v)] and organic buffer B [formic acid 0.1% (v/v) in acetonitrile] respectively.

Typically, ~2,000 samples can be injected in a chromatographic column before separation efficiency is lost, peaks degrade and retention times change. If the chromatogram shows poor peak shapes, this is indicative of column degradation or sample overloading. To solve this problem, dilute the sample or improve sample preparation. If the problem persists, consider cleaning or replacing the column.</li><li>The injection volume can be modified depending on the sample concentration:<br style="color:#666666;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13.3333px;text-align:justify;white-space:normal;"/><ol class="npwthree"><li>For concentrated samples (<em>e.g.</em>, PG from large starting cultures), inject less volume, ensuring the system is working within its detection limits.</li><li>If there are no or few peaks or the signal is too low, increase the injection, concentrate the sample using a Speedvac concentrator or prepare new sample by resuspending the washed sacculi in a lower volume prior to mutanolysin digestion.<br/></li></ol></li><li>Changes in the retention time can be due to improper sample pH or presence of detergent (SDS) in the sample. When sample pH is greater than 5, it results in shifted chromatograms. Adjust pH with orthophosphoric acid 25% (v/v) and rerun the sample. If there is detergent in the sample, either prepare new sample increasing the amount of washing steps or wash the column after each run to get rid of the retained detergent.</li><li>Improper sample reduction results in profiles with altered retention times.
