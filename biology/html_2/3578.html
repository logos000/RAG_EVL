            <h1>Spectrophotometric Assessment of Heme Oxygenase-1 Activity in <em>Leishmania</em>-infected Macrophages</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Moumita Basu, Shriya  Saha, Anindita  Ukil</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a stress responsive enzyme that metabolizes heme and releases free iron, carbon monoxide (CO), and biliverdin (BV), which rapidly undergoes conversion to bilirubin (BL). Estimation of bilirubin is the basis of HO-1 assay. HO-1 activity is widely employed to determine antioxidant response of cells under different physiological stress environment. Intra-macrophage infection often acts as such a stress inducer and measurement of HO-1 activity in infected cells indicates the ability of pathogens towards modulating oxidative response of host. The present protocol describes analysis of HO-1 activity in infected macrophages by spectrophotometric method, which is much less complex and therefore advantageous over other methods like high-performance liquid chromatography, radiochemical methods and detection of CO by gas chromatography. The main steps include: (1) Preparation of macrophage microsomal fraction containing HO-1 (2) Isolation of rat liver cytosolic fraction containing biliverdin reductase and (3) Assessment of heme oxygenase-1 activity by spectrophotometric detection of bilirubin. This method provides a simple and sensitive approach to measure cellular antioxidant response under infected condition.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the major host defense arsenals against invading pathogens used by macrophages (Missall <em>et al.</em>, 2004). On the other hand, intra-macrophage pathogens neutralize early oxidative burst for their successful persistence within macrophages (Paiva and Bozza, 2014). In response to such oxidative stress, organisms can deploy antioxidant enzymes of host cells such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) to scavenge ROS (Kathirvel <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Intracellular parasite <em>Leishmania donovani</em> could effectively exploit host antioxidant enzyme HO-1 for ROS neutralization (Saha <em>et al.</em>, 2019). HO-1 is a potent anti-oxidant enzyme catalysing the oxidative cleavage of heme to generate carbon monoxide (CO), ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), and biliverdin (BV). The biliverdin is further acted upon by another enzyme biliverdin reductase (BVR) to produce bilirubin (BL) (Tenhunen <em>et al.</em>, 1969).There are several techniques to quantify the activity of HO-1 based on detection of one of its ultimate reaction product bilirubin via high-performance liquid chromatography (Lincoln <em>et al.</em>, 1988; Ryter <em>et al.</em>, 1999), visible spectrophotometry (Schacter, 1978; Tenhunen <em>et al.</em>, 1969) and radiochemical methods (Sierra and Nutter, 1992). Detection of CO by gas chromatography (Vreman and Stevenson, 1988) has also been used to assay HO-1 activity, but because of its complexity and subsequent product analysis steps the protocol is not variedly applicable. Now, biliverdin is the primary metabolite of the heme degradation by HO-1. However, it has poor spectral properties with an extinction coefficient (Îµ) of ~8 to 10 mM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> (Kutty and Maines, 1981). Thus, most common HO-1 activity assays rely on the reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin. Original spectrophotometric quantification of bilirubin for detection of HO-1 activity was outlined by Tenhunen <em>et al.</em> (1969). In the method, bilirubin formation was monitored spectrophotometrically by the increase in absorbance at 468 nm (Îµ<sub>468</sub> = 43.5 mM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>), which is approximately 5-fold higher than that of biliverdin. Modifications of this main spectrophotometric assay for assessment of HO-1 activity was carried out and HO-1 activity was determined by monitoring bilirubin formation using the difference in absorbance at 464 to 530 nm (Îµ<sub>464-530</sub> = 40 mM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>) (Maines, 1996; Maines and Kappas, 1974).The current protocol (Figure 1) utilises the same principle but are performed with certain minor modifications to make it much more convenient.<br/></p>
