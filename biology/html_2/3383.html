            <h1>A Highly Sensitive, Reproducible Assay for Determining 4-hydroxynonenal  Protein Adducts in Biological Material</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> T. Blake Monroe, Ethan J. Anderson</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Oxidative stress is associated with numerous diseases, and markers of oxidative stress in biological material are becoming a mainstay of both experimental and clinical/epidemiological research. Lipid peroxidation is a major form of oxidative stress, but due to their rapid degradation and instability, lipid peroxides are notoriously difficult to measure, particularly in biological specimens where their production and removal are continuously occuring. Thus, a commonly used surrogate marker of lipid peroxidation is protein adducts of 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), an Î±, Î²-unsaturated hydroxyalkenal (<em>i.e.</em>, a reactive aldehyde) formed via degradation of oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). HNE adducts can be measured via commercially-available immunosorbent assays, but these have their limitations due to excessive costs, and reproducibility among laboratories is challenging due to variability in assay sensitivity, procedure, and reagents. Here we present a reproducible, facile, and economically conservative protocol for quantifying HNE protein adducts. The key to this protocol is to generate HNE-adduct standards by incubating bovine serum albumin (BSA) with HNE. These standards are then adsorbed to immunsorbent plastic in a multi-well plate format alongside biological samples. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is then performed on the multi-well plate using commercially-available primary and secondary antibodies, and a peroxide-based fluorescent developing reagent. This protocol is highly sensitive and offers advantages to commercial sources in that it allows for reproducible, high-throughput quantitation of HNE adducts in a large number of samples.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>When polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) become oxidized in cell membranes, there are only two possible outcomes: 1) resulting lipid peroxides (LOOHs) are neutralized via enzyme-dependent (<em>e.g.</em>, glutathione peroxidase-4, GPx4) and/or spontaneous reaction with redox-active molecules (<em>e.g.</em>, quinones); or 2) the LOOHs degrade into highly reactive aldehydes, capable of forming adducts with proteins, DNA and other lipids. One of the more common aldehydes formed is 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), an Î±, Î²-unsaturated aldehyde formed from peroxidation of n-6 PUFAs such as arachidonic acid and linoleic acid, both of which are abundant in phospholipid cell membranes. Accumulation of HNE and other related biogenic aldehydes, such as malondialdehyde, react with nucleophilic side chains in proteins and polypeptides to form stable protein adducts that can sometimes act as âtoxic second messengersâ of oxidative stress. These reactions constitute a form of oxidative stress referred to as carbonyl stress. Hydroxynonenal can noncompetitively inhibit the activity of antioxidant enzymes like aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) and aldo-ketoreductase (AKR), further exacerbating accumulation and cytotoxicity of reactive carbonyl species (Jinsmaa, <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Since LOOHs are notoriously difficult to directly measure <em>in vivo</em>, HNE-adducts serve as a surrogate biomarker of LOOHs, and the corresponding carbonyl stress imposed by them in cells and tissues have been reported in both experimental models and clinical studies of degenerative and age-related pathologies including Parkinsonâs Disease, obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and many cancers (Markesbery and Lovell, 1998; Orioli <em>et al.</em>; 1998; Selley, 1998; Traverso <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Frohnert <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Anderson <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Katunga <em>et al.</em>, 2015a; Anderson <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Hydroxynonenal tends to react with nucleophilic moieties, such as the side-chains of cysteine, lysine, and histidine, either the carbonyl group, forming a Schiff base, or the Î²-carbon, forming a Michael addition adduct.<br/><br/>A variety of assays for HNE-adduct detection are commercially available. Most of them employ an ELISA method, using a proprietary combination of antigen-capture or âsandwich-ELISAâ formulation. These assays can vary widely in sensitivity, leading to problems with reproducibility and data compatibility across laboratories. Here we present a facile, economically conservative and reproducible assay for determining HNE-adduct levels in serum, cell-, and tissue-lysates.</p>
