            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Working memory abnormalities involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) dramatically contribute to poor functional outcomes in patients with schizophrenia and still represent an unmet therapeutic need. Studies in rodents might provide essential tools to understand the mechanisms underlying PFC-dependent working memory dysfunctions, as well as precious tools for genetic and pharmacological testing. However, proper tests assessing working memory and sensitive to PFC-dependent functions must be used. In this regard, the discrete paired-trial variable-delay T-maze task, equivalent to delayed non-match to sample tasks used in humans, has proved to be an effective paradigm to test PFC-dependent working memory dysfunctions with high predictive validity in human studies.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The term working memory refers to the type of memory that is active and relevant only for a short period of time, on the scale of seconds, while performing complex tasks such as reasoning, comprehension and learning. The concept of working memory evolved from that of short-term memory and now it stands at the interface between perceptual processes and long-term memory formation. The major components of working memory, as suggested by Baddeley's model (Baddeley, 2010), are: i) a short-term storage buffer for visual-spatial information that provides a virtual environment for physical simulation, calculation, visualization and optical memory recall (often referred as the visuo-spatial scratch pad); ii) a short-term storage buffer for verbal information (referred to as the phonological loop); (iii) a central executive component that is responsible for response selection and for coordinating the outputs of different short-term memory buffers; iv) an episodic buffer, in which complex multimodal events are integrated and stored online. In this model, the maintenance of specific information is governed by the buffer systems, while the regulation and coordination of this information (<em>i.e.</em>, updating and maintenance of task goals, management of interference, and manipulation and transformations of stored content) are handled by the central executive processes. Impairments across the domains of phonological, visuo-spatial and central executive working memory are among the most consistently cognitive deficits observed in patients with schizophrenia (Castner <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Forbes <em>et al.</em>, 2009). The working memory central executive component has been associated in many studies with the function of the dorsolateral PFC. Instead, the storage buffers are thought to depend more on the inferior frontal cortex and parietal cortical areas (Wager and Smith, 2003). The remarkable correspondence between performances of human patients with frontal lobe lesions, PFC-lesioned monkeys and rodents and schizophrenic patients made the PFC-dependent tasks among the most used in behavioral/fMRI studies in schizophrenia and relative translational preclinical research (Callicott <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Kellendonk <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Papaleo <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Barch <em>et al.</em>, 2012).<br/><br/>There are numerous working memory tasks that have been employed and validated in rodents in order to reliably measure the maintenance of visuo-spatial information (Dudchenko, 2004; Kellendonk, <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Papaleo <em>et al.</em>, 2014), for example, the 8-arm radial maze âdelayed non-match to sampleâ or ââwin-shiftââ (Seamans <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Seamans and Phillips, 1994), the 8-arm maze ârandom foraging taskâ (Floresco <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Seamans <em>et al.</em>, 1995), the odor span tasks (Dudchenko, 2004; Young <em>et al.</em>, 2007) and some paradigms of delayed matching and delay non-matching to sample position operant conditioning tasks (Dunnett, 1993). These tasks involve an initial âsampleâ or âforced runâ phase in which the rodent is exposed to a visual target or an arm of the maze. Subsequently, in the âchoiceâ phase that is run after a variable delay, the subject is simultaneously presented with the original sample (the âmatchâ) and another visual target or arm (the ânon-matchâ). These pairs of phases must be presented repeatedly but importantly, with randomly changing cues presented in the sample phase. Thus, the working memory construct is based on the fact that the tested rodent is required to integrate information held online (the sample phase) with the learned rule (non-match or match to sample). This paradigm has been mostly implemented in mice using T-mazes (Aultman and Moghaddam, 2001; Kellendonk <em>et al.</em>, 2006). In this context, the discrete paired-trial variable-delay T-maze task seems to be similar to the human delayed response task and also it relies on mPFC functions (Kellendonk <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Indeed, it is based on the delayed non-match to position paradigm where the delayed alternations responses are driven by food reinforcement (Ji <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Leggio <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In particular, during a ''sample'' or "forced run", the experimental subject is forced to explore an arm of the maze. Then, after a variable delay, in the ''choice run'' phase the subject has to choose between the original sample (the ''match'') and the opposite arm (the ''non-match''). Rodents are then presented with a sequence of randomly chosen forced runs, each followed by a choice run. The working memory construct is based on the fact that the experimental animal is required to integrate information held online (the forced run) with the learned rule (non-match or match to sample). In this context, the role of PFC for supporting complex executive functions is well acknowledged (Scheggia <em>et al.</em>, 2018 and 2020), as well as the necessity of the hippocampus involvement for different tasks used to study the spatial working memory, such as the Radial Arm Maze (Myroshnychenko <em>et al.</em>, 2017) and the Morris Water Maze (Morris <em>et al.</em>, 1982; Dudchenko, 2004).</p>

After a week of single housing, body weight and 24-h food intake are recorded for 3 consecutive days. Animals are then food restricted throughout the experiment to maintain 90% of their ad libitum body weight. During the first week of food-restriction, each animal is also habituated to the food reinforcer (14 mg, 5TUL, TestDiet, Richmond, IN) for three consecutive days. Thereafter, animals are habituated to the T-maze apparatus allowing to retrieve the food reinforcement for 10 min/day for two consecutive days. After this, animals are exposed to 1 day of 10 forced-alternation runs. The animals are placed in the T-maze with one goal arm closed off and will have up to 2 min to locate and eat the food reinforcer in the open arm. After consuming the food pellet, each mouse is given an inter-trial period of at least 20 min in the home cage, and then placed back in the maze for another forced run. Beginning on the following day, the discrete-trial delayed alternation training starts. Following a randomly chosen forced run, and a 4-s delay interval in the home cage, the mouse is placed back in the maze with access to both arms. The food reinforcer is located in the opposite arm entered in the previous forced trial. After an inter-trial period of 20 min, the animal is placed back in the maze for another forced run-choice run paired trial, for a total of ten paired trials per day. A different pseudo-randomly chosen pattern of forced runs (<em>e.g.</em>, R-R-L-R-L-L-RL-R-L) is used every day, but on a given day the same pattern is used for all animals. The apparatus must be cleaned with water and ethanol 10% after each trial with special attention to the choice point of the T-maze. Mice are trained at a 4-s inter-run delay and 20-min inter-trial delay for 20 days, or until the mouse successfully performs 8 correct out of 10 daily trials (80% choice accuracy) for 3 consecutive days. Animals that do not reach this criterion are eliminated. Once the mouse performs consistently at the 4-s inter-run delay, training at three additional inter-run delays (30, 60 and 240 s presented in a random fashion) and a 20-s inter-trial delay begins. Mice are given 4 trials of each delay on 4 consecutive days of testing for a total of 16 trials for each day. <br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200630/20200630210452_7591.jpg" width="553"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

After consuming the reward, they are removed from the maze, one trial for each mouse. Run the experiment with about 10 cages in the room. Mice are tested back-to-back. One pellet at the end of the arms.</li><li>Day 20-Day 39: <u>Discrete paired-trial delayed alternation training</u><br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Each discrete trial consists of a forced runâchoice run pair.</li><li>For the forced run, animals are constrained to enter a randomly chosen arm. After they consume the reward in that arm (timer started as soon as the animal has finished food) and a <u>4-s retention interval</u> (this 4-s time is considered as a mean of time recorded to accomplished this procedure, see also Kellendonk <em>et al.</em>, 2006), each mouse is placed back in the maze with access to both arms but with only the opposite arm entered in the previous forced run baited. On the forced run bait the alley with 1 pellet; on the free choice run bait the correct alley with 2 pellets. After an inter-trial period of about 15-20 min to avoid proactive interference from the last trial (Kellendonk <em>et al.</em>, 2006), the mouse is placed back in the maze for another forced run. Test mice in the room back-to-back.</li><li>A different, randomly chosen, pattern of forced runs (for example, R-R-L-R-L-L-R-L-R-L) is used every day. However, on a given day the same pattern is used for all animals. Animals are trained at a 4-s inter-run delay for 20 days, or until they successfully perform eight out of 10 trials (80% correct choices) for 3 consecutive days.

Days to reach criterion (in days, Days 20-39) during the training phase can be analyzed through an unpaired (two sample) t-test or a one-way ANOVA to reveal main effect (<em>e.g.</em>, genotype or treatment) according to the number of experimental groups (two of more). Finally, percentage of correct choices (as index of working memory) during the final phase (day 40 or earlier) is also generally analyzed through two-way RM ANOVA to reveal main effects and interaction (<em>e.g.</em>, genotype Ã delay), followed by an appropriate <em>post-hoc</em> test.</li><li>Graphs in Figure 3 display Latency to eat (A), Days to criterion (B), and correct choices (%, C) that wild-type (WT) and knockout mice littermates (here Dys<sup>+/-</sup> mice) performed during the task (adapted from Leggio <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Both groups learned similarly to run quickly into the maze to retrieve the reward, as indicated by the significant decrease of the latency to eat during the second day (Day 18) of exposure to the reward compared to the first day (Day 17). Moreover, both groups required the same number of days to reach the criterion of 80% of correct choices for 3 consecutive days. However, although both groups exhibited delay-dependent behavior (progressive increase of errors with longer delays), Dys<sup>+/-</sup> mice showed significant working memory deficits than WT mice at both 4 and 30 s intra-run delays.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200630/20200630210534_8361.jpg" width="131"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.
