    <h1>Cell-based Assay for Recruitment of DDR1 to Collagen-coated Beads</h1>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Victoria Juskaite, Birgit Leitinger</p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The discoidin domain receptors, DDR1 and DDR2, are key signaling receptors for the extracellular matrix protein
        collagen. The interactions of cells with collagen are difficult to study because of the difficulty to obtain
        native collagen fibers for <em>in vitro</em> studies. Thus, <em>in vitro</em> studies often use acid-soluble
        collagens in the form of single triple helices, which are not representative of the densely packed insoluble
        collagen fibers found in tissues. In this protocol, we describe a method that allows stimulating DDR1 locally
        with collagen-coated beads. Latex beads are first coated with acid-soluble collagen, then added to cells
        expressing DDR1. Recruitment of DDR1 to the beads and collagen-induced DDR1 phosphorylation is visualized by
        immunofluorescence microscopy on a widefield microscope. In this method, densely packed collagen is presented to
        cells in an insoluble form. Bead coating is easy to perform, and this method thus presents a straightforward
        protocol with which to study local recruitment of collagen receptors to insoluble collagen.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Collagens are insoluble components of the extracellular matrix. Collagens provide structural support for
        connective tissues, and regulate fundamental cellular processes such as adhesion, proliferation, migration and
        differentiation (Kadler <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Shoulders and Raines, 2009). Collagens mediate these processes
        through interaction with specific cell surface receptors. Transmembrane collagen receptors include integrins,
        discoidin domain receptors (DDR1 and DDR2), glycoprotein VI, and leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like
        receptor-1 (Leitinger, 2011). Interaction of these receptors with collagen is often assayed <em>in vitro</em>
        using collagen in solution. However, collagens in solution do not represent the state of collagens found <em>in
            vivo</em>, which may be assembled as dense, insoluble fibers. Cell-based assays based on reconstituted
        collagen matrices that mimic the physiological organization of collagen in tissues are widely used
        (<em>e.g.</em>, Doyle, 2016; Di Martino <em>et al.</em>, 2017). In these assays, cells are added onto (or
        within) immobilized matrix. While these assays are excellent to study cellular behavior, the kinetics of
        recruitment of collagen interaction partners are more difficult to study. The method presented here describes
        local stimulation of cells with collagen presented on latex beads and recruitment of the collagen receptor DDR1
        to these beads. <br /><br />The DDRs are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that promote a wide range of human
        diseases including arthritis, organ fibrosis and many forms of cancer (Leitinger, 2014). Little is known about
        how collagen binding induces DDR kinase activity. Collagen-induced DDR autophosphorylation occurs with unusually
        slow kinetics (Shrivastava <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Vogel <em>et al.</em>, 1997). The DDRs are constitutive dimers
        in the absence of collagen (Noordeen <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Mihai <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Xu <em>et al.</em>,
        2014), ruling out the canonical model of ligand-induced RTK dimerization for kinase activation. Conformational
        changes within a dimer for DDR kinase activation were also ruled out (Xu <em>et al.</em>, 2014). We recently
        reported that collagen induces DDR1 activation through lateral dimer association and phosphorylation between
        dimers (Juskaite <em>et al.</em>, 2017). In the study, we used collagen presented on beads to recruit and
        phosphorylate DDR1 locally. We demonstrated that when co-expressed with functional DDR1 receptor, ligand-binding
        defective DDR1 mutants were recruited to the beads and were phosphorylated. These data with collagen-coated
        beads support the notion that collagen binding to DDR1 leads to lateral association of dimers. <br /><br />The
        method below describes recruitment of DDR1 to collagen-coated beads in Cos-7 cells transiently expressing DDR1.
        However, it may also be optimized for studying the interaction between collagen and other collagen receptors
        such as integrins.</p>

    <li>Antibody solutions<br />Antibodies were diluted in 8% BSA (w/v) in 1x PBS<br />Antibody dilutions: 2.5 Î¼g/ml
        for anti-DDR1, 1:1,000 for anti-phospho-DDR1 and 1:500 (4 Î¼g/ml) for fluorescent secondary antibodies
        <br /><em>Note: For blocking non-specific Ab binding, we used 8% BSA instead of the commonly used 5% BSA
            concentration, as we found that this condition reduced the background staining of the secondary
