            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Soil organisms are diverse taxonomically and functionally. This ecosystem experiences highly complex networks of interactions, but may also present functionally independent entities. Plant roots, a metabolically active hotspot in the soil, take an essential part in shaping the rhizosphere. Tracking the dynamics of root-microbe interactions at high spatial resolution is currently limited due to methodological intricacy. In this study, we developed a novel microfluidics-based device enabling direct imaging of root-bacteria interactions in real time.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Plant roots play a major role in shaping plant-microbe interactions within the rhizosphere, driving a dynamically changing microenvironment. Recent studies revealed multiple beneficial effects of root-associated bacteria (Hardoim <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Weyens <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Mei and Flinn, 2010; Santhanam <em>et al.</em>, 2015), highlighting the important role of rhizosphere interactions. Tracking these interactions with high spatio-temporal resolution is a challenging task that is primarily limited by available methodologies. Several microfluidic approaches have recently been adapted for the use in the plant sciences (reviewed by Sanati Nezhad, 2014 and Stanley <em>et al.</em>, 2016) mainly for root development and physiological studies (Englert <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Grossmann <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Jiang <em>et al.</em>, 2014). The TRIS device presented here builds on these developments to provide a robust platform for microscopy-based studies of the interactions between plant roots and associated microorganisms that can be implemented in a typical experimental biology laboratory (Massalha <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The TRIS device enables precise control over environmental parameters within the system while allowing direct observation of dynamic biological processes at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here we discuss in details the TRIS assembly and operation. Studying root-microbe interactions in this device allows the use of endless combinations of bacterial strains and plant genotypes that could be examined with multiple fluorescent reporters. Altogether, we hope and anticipate that the TRIS experimental system, and other platforms building upon it, will open the way for extensive high-resolution studies of the dynamic root microenvironment and interactions within it.</p>

Fix the mold to the plate with sticky tape.</li><li>Prepare 25 ml of the PDMS mixture based on the manufacturerâs recommendations. In a plastic weigh-boat, weigh 10 parts silicon elastomer then add 1 part of the curing agent. Mix well the two reagents using a plastic stick.</li><li>Place the dish in a desiccator and degas under vacuum for 1 h. It is important to remove all air bubbles from the PDMS mixture before pouring it to the fixed mold on the dish.</li><li>Blow nitrogen or air to remove any dust that may have accumulated on the mold. Carefully pour the degassed mixture over the silicon master.</li><li>Cure the PDMS for overnight at 60 Â°C.<br/><em>Note: Read the manufacturerâs suggestions for curing PDMS.</em> </li><li>Using a sharp blade (Scalpel) carefully cut out each adjacent 8/9 features in a single rectangular piece (Figures 1B and 1C). The patterned microchannels will be visible in the PDMS.</li><li>Punch holes at the channel inlets, outlets and the root hole (Figures 1C and 1D) with the 1 mm Harris Unicore hole punch.</li><li>After finishing making the holes, cover both sides of the channels (<em>e.g.</em>, with adhesive tape) to protect from dust particles and debris.</li><li>Before binding the PDMS slab to the glass slide, remove the adhesive tape, place the glass slide and PDMS channel side up on a clean flat surface. In order to activate the surfaces of the PDMS and the glass slide, which will lead to covalent bonding of the two materials, we used the hand-held corona generator approximately 1-2 cm above the surface. The surfaces were treated for 30 s uniformly over each surface.</li><li>Carefully place the PDMS device on the treated glass slide with the microchannel pattern facing the glass slide. Apply gentle, uniform pressure by hand to ensure a uniform seal.</li><li>Bake the mounted channel with the glass slide at 100 Â°C for 20 min directly after sealing.</li><li>Autoclave the mounted microfluidic devices once at 120 Â°C for 20 min. Store the autoclaved samples sterilely at room temperature conditions.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="161" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190412/20190412012841_9076.jpg" width="102"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

The relative intensity of the bacterial fluorescence is used to estimate the density of the bacteria and calculated by subtracting the background for each time point from the region of interest.
