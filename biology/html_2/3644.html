            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Methods to test both the functionality and mechanism of action for human recombinant proteins and antibodies <em>in vitro</em> have been limited by multiple factors. To test the functionality of a recombinant protein or antibody, the receptor, the receptor-associated ligand, or both must be expressed by the cells present within the <em>in vitro</em> culture. While the use of transfected cell lines can circumvent this gap, the use of transfected cell lines does not allow for studying the native signaling pathway(s) modulated by the specific recombinant protein or antibody in primary cells. The present protocol utilizes sort purified CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and T cells, both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, from healthy donors in a co-culture system. This methodology is particularly relevant for testing recombinant proteins or antibodies that are putative therapeutics for the treatment of autoimmune disease and cancer. While the current protocol focuses on co-cultures containing B7-H4 expressing monocytes plus either autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the protocol can be modified for the userâs specific needs.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The clinical use of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, <em>e.g.</em>, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1, has proven useful as a cancer therapy to enhance the anti-tumor immune response (Curran <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Gubin <em>et al.</em>, 2014). While successful in patients that have failed frontline therapy, only approximately 20% of treated patients responded to checkpoint inhibitor antibody therapy. This inactivity of treatment in a patient may be multifactorial, and may also be reflective of the specific type of cancer that a patient presents with to the clinician (Podojil <em>et al.</em>, 2020). B7-H4 expression by tumor cells and monocyte/macrophages present within the tumor is an additional putative mechanism by which tumor cells evade anti-tumor immune responses (Salceda <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Simon <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Qian <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Abadi <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Based on these published findings, the expression of B7-H4 within the tumor microenvironment, <em>i.e.</em>, by the tumor cells and/or by infiltrating monocyte/macrophages, is hypothesized to allow for tumor cells to evade an anti-tumor immune response via both direct inhibition of effector T cell function and increasing regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function (Wei <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Podojil <em>et al.</em>, 2013).<br/> <br/>The development of <em>in vitro</em> methods to determine the functionality of immunological therapeutics for the treatment of human disease has relied heavily on the use of cell lines. However, while there are similarities between the signaling pathways activated within human T cells lines (Jurkat and HuT78) and primary T cells isolated from PBMCs, there are distinct differences between the level of signaling pathway intermediate activation, the timing/longevity of signaling pathway intermediate activation, and the cytokine profile expressed between human T cells lines and primary T cells (Bartelt <em>et al.</em>, 2009). For example, besides IL-2, both Jurkat and HuT78 cells are less depenent upon costimulation and secreted significantly lower levels of T cell effector cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-17, TNF-Î±, and IFN-Î³ upon T cell receptor stimulation (Bartelt <em>et al.</em>, 2009). This finding limits the utility of these cell lines when studying the ability of a recombinant protein or antibody to modulate cellular activities outside of T cell proliferation and IL-2 production.<br/> <br/>The present method can be used to determine the functionality of therapeutics utilizing primary monocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells purified from healthy human donors. Several cellular considerations for determining the functionality and identifying/validating the mechanism of action for a putative checkpoint inhibitor are required for assay development. The assay must be fit-for-purpose, robust, repeatable, and transferable between collaborating laboratories. In the present example for the study of anti-B7-H4 functional activity, cells that express B7-H4 must be present within the culture system, <em>i.e.</em>, a macrophage population that has been pre-conditioned in the presence of recombinant human cytokines to induce the expression of B7-H4. Additionally, the B7-H4 receptor must be expressed by a target immune cell population, <em>i.e.</em>, T cells. The B7-H4 receptor is expressed by a sub-set of both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following activation (Podojil <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Therefore, an additional consideration for the present experimental design is that since the B7-H4 receptor is not present at high levels on freshly isolated T cells, the response rate within the co-culture system will display donor-to-donor variation.<br/> <br/>To this end, two general model are presented below. The first model utilized co-culture of B7-H4 expressing human macrophages with autologous purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and the second model system utilized co-culture of B7-H4 expressing human macrophages with autologous purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In brief, CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes are isolated from total PBMCs, and the CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes are cultured in the absence or presence of IL-10 and IL-6 for 3 days. Both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are isolated from the CD14- cell fraction of the healthy donor PBMC samples. The sort purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are cryopreserved for future co-culture with the B7-H4 expressing macrophages. Figure 1 presents the number of each cell population isolated from twelve healthy donor PBMC samples. Following the initial 3 day macrophage culture in the presence of IL-10 and IL-6, the macrophages are harvested. The data show that macrophages cultured in the absence of IL-10 and IL-6 do not express B7-H4, while macrophages cultured in the presence of IL-10 and IL-6 do express B7-H4 (Podojil <em>et al.</em>, 2020). On day 3, the cryopreserved autologous CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are rapidly thawed, washed, and labeled with CFSE. The CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are then co-cultured with IL-10 plus IL-6 conditioned macrophages in the presence of plate-bound anti-CD3 plus either a species and isotype matched Control antibody or anti-B7-H4. On day 6 of the assay (day 3 of macrophage-T cell co-culture) the level of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation is assessed via flow cytometry (CFSE dilution), and the levels of secreted cytokine, such as IFN-Î³, determined in the culture supernatants. While the use of transfected cell lines is a useful tool to quickly screen large numbers of recombinant proteins and antibodies for potential biological activity, the present protocol using primary cells allows for the validation of the initial <em>in vitro</em> cell line culture findings.</p>

The hypothesis being that since the B7-H4 receptor is induced on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following activation, this would increase the percentage/number of T cells within the IL-10 plus IL-6 conditioned macrophage and CFSE-labeled T cell co-cultures that could be modulated by the addition of anti-B7-H4. However, the data show that while activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells do in fact proliferated to a greater extent as compared to cryopreserved CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, this increased level of activation may mask the ability to detect an anti-B7-H4-induced increase in activity.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34238">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>1x DPBS + 2 mM EDTA (500 ml)<br/>498 ml of 1x DPBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup><br/>2 ml of EDTA (0.5 M, pH 8.0)</li><li>1x DPBS + 5% FCS (500 ml)<br/>975 ml of 1x DPBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup><br/>25 ml of FCS</li><li>Completed RPMI Medium (1,000 ml)<br/>849 ml RPMI 1640 Medium without glutamine<br/>100 ml of FCS<br/>10 ml of MEM non-essential amino acid solution<br/>10 ml of L-glutamine-200 mM (100x)<br/>10 ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin<br/>10 ml of Sodium pyruvate (100 mM solution with 8.5 g/L NaCl)<br/>10 ml of HEPES (1 mM)<br/>1 ml of 2-mercaptoethanol (1,000x)</li><li>Cell Freezing Medium (2x stock)<br/>20% DMSO<br/>80% FBS<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34239">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">Development of this protocol was partially funded by NIH grant NS30871.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34240">### Competing interests</p><p class="ppzz">The authors have no financial or non-financial competing interests relative to this protocol.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34241">### Ethics</p><p class="ppzz">For the completion of the present assay, the research must have IRB approval for the collection of whole blood from healthy donors.
