            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Sulfated glycans are barely detectable in routine mass spectrometry (MS)-based glycomic analysis due to ion suppression by the significantly more abundant neutral glycans in the positive ion mode, and sialylated non-sulfated glycans in the negative ion mode, respectively. Nevertheless, the negative charge imparted by sulfate can be advantageous for selective detection in the negative ion mode if the sialic acids can first be neutralized. This is most conveniently achieved by a concerted sample preparation workflow in which permethylation is followed by solid phase fractionation to isolate the sulfated glycans prior to MS analysis. Importantly, we demonstrated that conventional NaOH/DMSO slurry permethylation method can retain the sulfates. Instead of extracting permethylated glycans into chloroform for sample clean-up, reverse phase C18 cartridge coupled with self-packed amine-tip or mixed mode weak anion exchange cartridge can be utilized to obtain in good yield the non-sulfated, mono-sulfated, and multiply sulfated permethylated glycans in separate fractions for sulfoglycomic analysis.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Sulfated glycans carrying sulfo sialyl LeX glycotope are ligands of L-selectin involved in lymphocyte homing in physiological and inflammatory states (Rosen, 2004; Kawashima, 2006). Many glycan array studies also showed that sulfated glycotopes are better ligands of several galectins (Ideo <em>et al.</em>, 2002) and Siglecs (Bochner <em>et al.</em>, 2005). However, there is very limited knowledge of endogenous sulfated glycans expressed on different types of mammalian cells, tissues or organism due to their low abundance and availability of few well-defined antibodies. Advanced mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis is the only viable technique that would afford the requisite high sensitivity and accuracy for a meaningful probing of the cellular sulfoglycome.<br/><br/>Sulfated glycans are not readily detected in the conventional MS-based glycomic profiling. For analysis of non-derivatized, native sulfated glycans in the negative ion mode, the main problem is that sialylated glycans also carry negative charges and these are usually more abundant. Removing the sialic acids by treatment with sialidase is commonly applied (Hernandez Mir <em>et al.</em>, 2009), but information on the sulfated sialylated glycans, which maybe the true physiological ligands for endogenous lectins is lost. For permethylated glycans, the advantages are neutralization of the negative charge of sialic acid and more reliable, sequence informative fragment ions can be obtained by MS/MS analyses. A precondition though is that the widely used sample clean-up method following permethylation, such as extraction by chloroform/water partition, which would result in loss of permethylated sulfated glycans into the aqueous layer, should be avoided (Morelle and Michalski, 2007; Kumagai <em>et al.</em>, 2013).<br/><br/>We have shown that the conventional NaOH/DMSO slurry permethylation can retain the sulfates, and reverse phase (C18) solid phase extraction cartridge can be used to replace chloroform extraction (Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Khoo and Yu, 2010). Both permethylated non-sulfated and sulfated glycans are retained, extensively washed, and then eluted without introducing salts. MALDI-MS screening of permethylated glycans in the negative ion mode gives a quick survey for the presence of sulfated glycans. Instead of using 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), which is a common matrix for glycan analysis in the positive ion mode (Harvey, 1993), we found that 3,4-diaminobenzophenone (DABP) afforded a better sensitivity for detecting permethylated sulfated glycans in the negative ion mode. Non-sulfated, mono-sulfated, di-sulfated permethylated glycans can be further fractionated by using a self-packed amine tip. Alternatively, a mixed mode weak anion exchange (MAX) cartridge containing both reverse phase and weak anion exchange properties can be used to replace the two-step process of cleaning and fractionation (Cheng <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Cheng <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Hsiao <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The developed workflow for sulfoglycomics (Figure 1) has been successfully applied to many different biological samples such as lymph nodes from different glycosyltransferase/sulfotransferase knockout mice (Mitoma <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Patnode <em>et al.</em>, 2013), ovarian cancer (Shibata <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2013), colon cancer (Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2018), immune cells (Patnode <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Collectively, it showed that sulfated <em>N</em>- and <em>O</em>-glycans have a wider and ubiquitous occurrence than previously appreciated.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200511/20200511022802_0736.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Schematic workflow for MS-based sulfoglycomic analyses. </strong>The key steps are reverse phase C18 which retains all permethylated glycans, and further fractionation of sulfated permethylated glycans from non-sulfated ones by amine beads. Alternatively, a mixed mode anion exchange (MAX) SPE is equally effective. MALDI-MS screening in the negative ion mode affords a quick profile of the sulfoglycome. This protocol is applicable to all commonly found sulfated <em>N</em>-glycans and <em>O</em>-glycans, irrespective of their reducing end status. The procedure for additional nanoLC-nanoESI-MS/MS analyses was described in another paper entitled âNegative Ion Mode nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS Analyses of Permethylated Sulfated Glycansâ in <em>Bio-protocol</em> (Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2020).

In mammalian glycosylation, the common glycosyl residues are Hex, HexNAc, dHex (Fuc), Neu5Ac, and Neu5Gc, and the nominal masses of the permethylated forms are 204, 245, 174, 361, and 391 u, respectively. The accurate monoisotopic and average mass of different monosaccharide forms can be readily calculated or referring to Table I in Dell <em>et al.</em> (1994). For MALDI-MS of permethylated glycans in the negative ion mode, non-sulfated permethylated glycans do not normally afford any negative ion signal since all hydroxyl (OH) groups have been derivatized to <em>O</em>-methyl (OMe), and the carboxylic (COOH) group of sialic acids to methyl esters (COOMe).<br/></li><li>To calcgly charged <em>m/z</em> values of sulfated permethylated glycans in the negative ion mode, use the general formula:<div><ol class="npwthree"><li>Mono-sulfated permethylated glycans, detected as [M-H]<sup>-</sup><br/><em>m/z</em> = (CH<sub>3</sub> + OCH<sub>3</sub>) + Î£ glycosyl residue masses + (OSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-OCH<sub>3</sub>)<br/></li><li>Di-sulfated permethylated glycans, detected as [M+Na-2H]<sup>-</sup><br/><em>m/z</em> = (CH<sub>3</sub> + OCH<sub>3</sub>) + Î£ glycosyl residue masses+ 2 x (OSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-OCH<sub>3</sub>) +23</li></ol></div>(CH<sub>3</sub> + OCH<sub>3</sub>) corresponds to the respective non-reducing and reducing end masses, which is 46 u in nominal mass. For the <em>O</em>-glycans that were released from glycoproteins via reductive elimination, as well as any other pre-reduced <em>N</em>-glycans, their reducing end would be in an alditol state (annotated as -itol), and the corresponding nominal mass would be 62 u. (OSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-OCH3) refers to the first sulfate carried, which corresponds to a 65 u mass increment, and contributing to the negative charge. Thereafter, for di- and multiply sulfated glycans, each additional sulfate group contributes to 88 u (65 + 23 u) mass increment from the mono-sulfated glycan due to the charge of second sulfate being counter balanced by a sodium. For examples in Figure 3, the [M-H]<sup>-</sup> molecular ion signal at <em>m/z</em> 1386 for a mono-sulfated NeuAc<sub>1</sub>Hex<sub>2</sub>HexNAc<sub>2</sub>-itol corresponds to [62 + 361 + 204 x 2 + 245 x 2 + 65], whereas the [M+Na-2H]<sup>-</sup> molecular ion signal at <em>m/z</em> 1562 for a di-sulfated Hex<sub>3</sub>HexNAc<sub>3</sub>-itol corresponds to [62 + 204 x 3 + 245 x 3 + 65 + 88].</li><li>The signal corresponding to loss of sodium sulfite (-102 u, NaSO<sub>3</sub>) from di- and multiply sulfated glycans during MALDI ionization are often produced easily.

The detailed protocol was described in Khoo and Yu (2010).</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti33165">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>2.5% ACN (200 ml)<br/>5 ml of 100% ACN<br/>195 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>10% ACN (200 ml)<br/>20 ml of 100% ACN<br/>180 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>25% ACN (200 ml)<br/>50 ml of 100% ACN<br/>150 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>50% ACN (200 ml)<br/>100 ml of 100% ACN<br/>100 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>0.1% TFA (50 ml)<br/>50 Î¼l of TFA in 49.95 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>75% ACN, 0.1% TFA (50 ml)<br/>37.5 ml of 100% ACN<br/>12.45 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O<br/>50 Î¼l of TFA</li><li>95% ACN (50 ml)<br/>47.5 ml of 100% ACN<br/>2.5 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>95% ACN, 0.1% FA (50 ml)<br/>47.5 ml of 100% ACN<br/>2.45 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O<br/>50 Î¼l of FA</li><li>50% ACN, 0.1% FA (50 ml)<br/>25 ml of 100% ACN<br/>24.95 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O<br/>50 Î¼l of FA</li><li>1 M ammonium acetate (NH<sub>4</sub>OAc)<br/>Prepare 100 ml of 1 M ammonium acetate (NH<sub>4</sub>OAc) in deionized water as stock solution:<br/>7.7 g NH<sub>4</sub>OAc, 100 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>50% ACN, 2.5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc (50 ml)<br/>25 ml of 100% ACN<br/>0.125 ml of 1M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc<br/>24.875 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>50% ACN, 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc (50 ml)<br/>25 ml of 100% ACN<br/>0.5 ml of 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc<br/>24.5 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc (200 ml)<br/>20 ml of 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc<br/>180 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>80% ACN, 1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc (200 ml)<br/>160 ml of 100% ACN<br/>0.2 ml of 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc<br/>39.8 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>60% ACN, 20% methanol, 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc (200 ml)<br/>120 ml of 100% ACN<br/>40 ml of methanol<br/>20 ml of 1 M NH<sub>4</sub>OAc<br/>20 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti33166">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">The sulfoglycomic workflow based on MALDI-MS analysis of permethylated glycans was originally developed by Yu <em>et al.</em> (2009), described in Khoo and Yu (2010), and further refined by introducing the MAX fractionation method, as described in Cheng <em>et al.</em> (2013).
