            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Single cell RNA sequencing is a very powerful means for cellular heterogeneous studies and so becoming wildly utilized nowadays. To guarantee the success of such analysis, it is very important, though sometimes difficult, to obtain single cells suspension with high quality, especially from the primary solid organs like mammary glands. Digestion of mouse or human mammary glands with enzymes was previously described. However, the yield, viability, especially the separation degree of the cells have rarely been noticed in these studies. Here we described a detailed protocol for the single epithelial cells suspension preparation from mouse mammary glands, which could be applied for single cell RNA sequencing on different platforms. This protocol could be well adapted for dissociation of other solid organs and tumors, and the single cell suspension could be also used for many other experiments.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The mammary gland is very heterogeneous, including many distinct types of cells, such as epithelia, endothelia, adipocytes, fibroblasts and immune cells. The abnormality of epithelia is the main cause for many mammary diseases, like mammary tumors (Prat and Perou, 2009). So, it is of great significance to study the cellular heterogeneity of mammary epithelia in normal and disease conditions. And the single cell RNA sequencing is one of the methods used to study the cellular heterogeneity. The mammary epithelium is mainly composed of two distinct lineages, the basal and luminal cells (Shackleton <em>et al.</em>, 2006). According to previous studies, these two cells populations could be well distinguished through flow cytometry analysis for the mouse mammary cells by using cell surface markers CD24 and CD29 (or CD24 and CD49f), as the basal and luminal cells are characterized with CD24<sup>Mid</sup>CD29<sup>Hi</sup> cells and CD24<sup>Hi</sup>CD29<sup>Lo</sup>, respectively (Shackleton <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Still little attention was paid on the cell numbers, viability and the separation degree of the cells in the flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting. But the cell quality is very important for the single cell RNAseq experiments. To meet this end, we devised a protocol with the combination of the red blood cellsâ removal, epithelial cellsâ enrichment, and futher cell sorting to separate basal and luminal cells with high cell viability. Itâs a better approach to prepare single cells suspension for single cell RNA sequencing. Besides, the protocol has been verified for its adaption towards other solid organs, like liver and brain, as well as tumor/cancer tissues from breast, liver, colon and other organs of mouse and human.</p>
