            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Although many spherical and rod-shaped plant virus purification protocols are now available, only a few protocols on filamentous plant virus purification have been published. Here, we report a protocol for large-scale purification of Rice stripe virus (RSV) from RSV-infected rice tissues. RSV virions with high infectivity were first precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) followed by pelleting through primary ultracentrifugation, ultracentrifugation in a glycerol cushion and ultracentrifugation in density gradient. The purified RSV virions can not only be viewed as filamentous particles under an electron microscope, but can also be acquired by insect vector through direct injection into insect body or through membrane feeding prior to transmission to rice plants.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Many purification protocols for spherical and rod-shaped viruses have been published (AndrÃ© <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Balke <em>et al.</em>, 2018). These protocols all rely on chemical precipitations or density gradient centrifugations. However, purification protocols for filamentous viruses are currently limited.<br/><br/>Rice stripe virus (RSV) is a negative-stranded RNA virus and belongs to the genus <em>Tenuivirus</em>, the order <em>Bunyavirales</em>. RSV often causes severe damages to rice productions in many East Asian countries (Whitfield <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Unlike other members in the order <em>Bunyavirales</em> that produce spherical and enveloped virions, RSV virions are filamentous. However, RSV genome encodes a glycoprotein that is not found in purified RSV virions(Toriyama, 1986; Lu <em>et al.</em>, 2019). RSV virions are known to carry several copies of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), necessary for virus replication initiation in host plants and insect vectors. Consequently, establishment of a purification method that allows to maintain active RSV RdRp is crucial for future biological assays using purified virions.<br/><br/>Based on a recent report from our laboratory (Lu <em>et al.</em>, 2019), we have now developed a purification protocol suitable for producing highly infectious RSV virions. The purified virions can be used for Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and virus transmission assays through insect vectors.</p>

After removal of the uranyl acetate solution, the grid is examined under an electron microscope.
