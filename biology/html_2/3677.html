            <h1>Tyramide Signal-Amplified Immunofluorescence of MYCN and MYC in Human Tissue Specimens and Cell Line Cultures</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Johanna M. Schafer, Jennifer A. Pietenpol</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>MYC family members, MYC, MYCN, and MYCL, are oncogenic transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in normal development, cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and survival. While MYC is amplified and/or overexpressed across a variety of tissue types, MYCN is often overexpressed in tumors of the nervous system (neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma) or with neuroendocrine features (neuroendocrine prostate cancer). Given recent reports that MYCN expression is also deregulated in a variety of non-neuronal tissue types, we investigated whether MYCN was also deregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In contrast to previous individual immuno-fluorescence (IF) stains against higher expressing MYC family isoform protein, we developed an IF stain to simultaneously detect both MYCN- and MYC-expressing cells within the same tumor cell population. Our methodology allows for the detection of low level MYCN and MYC expression and can be multiplexed with additional protein probes. Herein, using tyramide signal amplification (TSA), we present two protocols for the IF detection of MYCN and MYC on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sections and in cell lines fixed <em>in situ</em> after growth as adherent cultures on chambered microscope slides.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated MYCN and MYC preferentially regulate the same set of core genes involved in metabolism and cell growth, and while the MYCN allele can functionally replace MYC in murine development (Malynn <em>et al.</em>, 2000), MYCN and MYC have separate temporal regulation over organogenesis in early vertebrate development (Hurlin, 2013). <em>MYCN</em> expression is essential for initial establishment of stem and progenitor populations; over the course of organ system development, <em>MYCN</em> expression switches to low <em>MYC</em> expression to support stem and progenitor cell maintenance, and during cell lineage commitment and expansion, elevated <em>MYC</em> levels drive highly proliferative cells until they reach terminal differentiation (Hurlin, 2013).<br/><br/>A similar relationship has been observed in the development of TNBC metastases where MYCN expression is elevated in newly seeded metastatic lesions that expand and differentiate into highly proliferative MYC-expressing tumors (Lawson <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Given the near ubiquitous nature of MYC deregulation across tumor tissue types, MYC is the most studied MYC family member. However, due to a correlation between deregulated MYCN expression and a poor prognosis (Beltran, 2014), MYCN has been increasingly studied in both neuronal and non-neuronal cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (Kawagoe et al., 2007), small-cell lung cancer (Funa <em>et al.</em>, 1987), ovarian cancer (Baratta <em>et al.</em>, 2015), and now TNBC (Schafer <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Therefore, we began to explore the relationship between MYCN and MYC by developing an IF stain that could simultaneously detect both isoforms within the same tumor tissue section. Established protocols that involve the IF detection of MYCN or MYC have been separate stains that primarily recognizes each isoform at highly amplified/overexpressed levels. Given that TNBC and other non-neuronal tissue types exhibit aberrant low-level MYCN expression, we developed a method to detect lower expression of MYCN and MYC using TSA. Further, we have two protocol versions of the method: application of the dual MYC family isoform (MYCN and MYC) TSA-IF to FFPE tumor sections, and a modified version of the stain for evaluation MYC family isoforms expression in cell line cultures fixed <em>in situ</em> after growth as adherent cultures on chambered microscope slides. We anticipate both MYCN and MYC are coexpressed in a variety of cancer tissue types and the advent of these IF methodologies will allow investigators to further characterize MYCN- versus MYC-expressing cells in tumor development and disease etiology.<br/></p>
