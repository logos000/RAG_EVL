            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are a widely used model system for a range of applications including membrane biophysics, drug delivery, and the study of actin dynamics. While several protocols have been developed for their generation in recent years, the use of these techniques involving charged lipid types and buffers of physiological ionic strength has not been widely adopted. This protocol describes the generation of large numbers of free-floating GUVs, even for charged lipid types and buffers of higher ionic strength, using a simple approach involving soft polyacrylamide (PAA) gels. This method entails glass cover slip functionalization with (3-Aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTES) and glutaraldehyde to allow for covalent bonding of PAA onto the glass surface. After polymerization of the PAA, the gels are dried <em>in vacuo</em>. Subsequently, a lipid of choice is evenly dispersed on the dried gel surface, and buffers of varying ionic strength can be used to rehydrate the gels and form GUVs. This protocol is robust for the production of large numbers of free-floating GUVs composed of different lipid compositions under physiological conditions. It can conveniently be performed with commonly utilized laboratory reagents.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>While gentle hydration and electroformation are two of the most commonly used methods for giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) formation, there are only a few studies that report their use for charged lipid types and in buffers of physiological ionic strength (Stein <em>et al.</em>, 2017; LefranÃ§ois <em>et al.</em>, 2018). In 2009, Horger and colleagues described a simple gel-assisted swelling method for GUV generation that utilized a hybrid film of agarose gel and lipids. Unlike many other techniques, this method is capable of producing GUVs in buffers of physiological ionic strength and with charged lipid types (Horger <em>et al.</em>, 2009). However, it was later determined that the agarose was incorporated into the GUVs, thereby affecting their mechanical properties (Lira <em>et al.</em>, 2014). While other methods using poly(vinyl alcohol) (Weinberger <em>et al.</em>, 2013) or dextran(ethylene glycol) (LÃ³pez Mora <em>et al.</em>, 2014) have successfully developed GUVs without the incorporation of the gel into the vesicle membrane, they have not been widely utilized; this is likely due to the relatively uncommon reagents required. In our recent report (Parigoris <em>et al.</em>, 2020), we describe another facile gel-assisted swelling method using soft polyacrylamide (PAA) gels. This technique can generate GUVs composed of both neutral and charged lipids, and under conditions of physiological ionic strength. Like the agarose gel method proposed by Horger <em>et al.</em> (2009), our method utilizes common chemicals present in most laboratories, and to our knowledge, does not encapsulate PAA monomers inside of the vesicles.<br/></p>
