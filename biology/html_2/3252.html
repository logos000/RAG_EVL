            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>For many infectious diseases T cells are an important part of naturally acquired protective immune responses, and inducing these by vaccination has been the aim of much research. Here, we describe a protocol for the analysis of vaccine-induced antigen-specific immune responses. For this purpose, cells of whole spleens obtained from vaccinated BALB/c mice were <em>ex vivo</em> stimulated with the antigen incorporated in the vaccine. Evaluation and characterization of vaccine-induced adaptive T cell responses was performed by assaying spleen cell proliferation through radioactive <sup>3</sup>[H]-thymidine incorporation and multiplex cytokine analysis of IL-2, IFN-Î³ and TNFÎ± in supernatants from spleen cell suspensions. This protocol can be very useful as a starting point for assessing vaccine-induced memory T cell populations in pre-clinical studies.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>T cells have an essential role in protection against a variety of infections by controlling or delaying the onset of disease. Thus, vaccine development for these infections is focused on generating protective T-cell responses (Seder and Hill, 2000). Therefore, selecting T-cell readouts to measure in pre-clinical vaccines studies to assess immunogenicity would aid progress on T cell vaccines. Ideally, a T cellâvaccine would induce long-lived memory T cells, characterized as central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>) within lymphoid tissues, <em>i.e.</em>, lymph nodes and spleen, and effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>) within peripheral tissues. Memory T cells when encounter the previously given antigen via vaccination they are clonally expanded in order to differentiate into effector cells. A key mechanism by which T cells mediate their effector function is through the simultaneous production of IFN-Î³, TNFÎ± and IL-2 (Darrah <em>et al.</em>, 2007). IFN-Î³ synergize with TNFÎ± to promote killing of pathogens through activation of macrophages, whereas IL-2 strongly enhances the expansion of T cells leading to more efficient effector responses. Therefore, among the most common ways to assess the existence of vaccine-induced cell effector populations is to measure spleen cell proliferation and IL-2, TNFÎ± and IFN-Î³ production upon <em>ex vivo</em> stimulation with the antigens that have been incorporated in the vaccine (Seder <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Cell proliferation encompasses DNA synthesis, mitosis and an increase in cell number. The <sup>3</sup>[H]-thymidine incorporation assay allows the measurement of <sup>3</sup>[H]-thymidine into DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle as a quantitative measure of new DNA synthesis and yields statistically significant data even in the presence of low number of divided cells. This is achieved due to the linear relationship between the count rates and the rate of DNA synthesis (Ahern <em>et al.</em>, 1976). Thus, this method has been a gold standard for measuring cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte cultures. If the goal of the study is not only to determine DNA synthesis but also to characterize the fraction of cells in the S phase, then CFSE labeling stands out as a versatile alternative. Despite the fact that the <sup>3</sup>[H]-thymidine incorporation assay is a radioactive method, it is still considered one of the best and most reliable methods providing statistically significant data. On the other hand, there are various established methods for assessing cytokine production. Typically, ELISA and ELISpot assays are the gold standard methods for quantifying antigen-specific cellular responses after vaccination but they are limited only to a single parameter readout (Ranieri <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Intracellular cytokine staining and analysis by flow cytometry is another method of choice as it allows both multi-parameter cytokine analysis and phenotyping of cells (Freer and Rindi, 2013). However, it is characterized by many disadvantages. Among them are that it is labor intensive, it costs more per sample and requires a large number of cells (Freer and Rindi, 2013). On the other hand, multiplex arrays allow multiple cytokine analysis using different fluorescent beads that depending on the kit used a maximum of 80 cytokines can be investigated. The cytometric bead array system and the Luminex multi-analyte profiling (xMAP) technology both employ beads sets which are distinguishable under flow cytometry in the absence of Luminex machine. Moreover, they have been used in various pre-clinical studies to explore cytokines profiles induced by vaccination, since different samples can be used, <em>i.e.</em>, serum or cell-supernatant (Flaxman and Ewer, 2018). Based on the above, we describe a detailed protocol for assessing activation and effector functions of antigen-specific spleen cell populations using <sup>3</sup>[H]-thymidine incorporation and Luminex assays.</p>

Also, the final dilution of cells in Trypan blue dye depends on the approximate number of cells present. If the sample is not diluted enough, the cells will be too crowded and difficult to count. If it is too dilute, the sample size will not be enough to make strong inferences about the concentration in the original mixture. By performing a redundant test on a second chamber, the results can be compared. Thus, the aliquot should contain a convenient number of cells to count in a Neubauer.

Also, caution is needed to the time the cells are left with the dye since longer incubation periods will lead to cell death and reduced viability counts.

The maintenance of laboratory mice and <em>in vivo</em> studies were performed in SPF (Specific Pathogens Free) conditions at the approved establishments of Department of Animal Models for Biomedical Research, Hellenic Pasteur Institute under the registered codes EL25BIO011, EL25BIO012 and EL25BIO013. Animals were housed at room temperature 22 Â± 2 Â°C, relative humidity 40-70% and 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. All procedures complied to PD 56/2013 and European Directive 2010/63/EU, welfare and ethical use of laboratory animals based on 3+1R: Replacement, Reduction, Refinement and Respect and the guidelines of PREPARE (Planning Research and Experimental Procedures on Animals: Recommendations for Excellence), ARRIVEs and ARRIGE (Association for Responsible Research and Innovation in Genome Editing). Animalsâ welfare was assessed by the competent users and was supervised daily by the members of Institutional Welfare Body.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27891">### References</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Agallou, M., Athanasiou, E., Koutsoni, O., Dotsika, E. and Karagouni, E.
