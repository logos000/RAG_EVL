            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>A viral vector that can safely and efficiently deliver large and diverse molecular cargos into cells is the holy grail of curing many human diseases. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been extensively used but has a very small capacity. The prokaryotic virus T4 has a large capacity but lacks natural mechanisms to enter mammalian cells. Here, we created a hybrid vector by combining T4 and AAV into one nanoparticle that possesses the advantages of both. The small 25 nm AAV particles are attached to the large 120 nm x 86 nm T4 head through avidin-biotin cross-bridges using the phage decoration proteins Soc (small outer capsid protein) and Hoc (highly antigenic outer capsid protein). AAV thus âpiggy-backedâ on T4 capsid, by virtue of its natural ability to enter many types of human cells efficiently acts as a âdriverâ to deliver large cargos associated with the T4 head. This unique T4-AAV hybrid vector approach could pave the way for the development of novel therapeutics in the future.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>There has been a desperate need for new and efficient delivery vehicles that can transport large cargos of genes and proteins into human cells to stimulate the production of therapeutic biomolecules and/or to repair cellular and genetic defects. Such vehicles will allow translation of the rapidly emerging technologies such as CRISPR, CAR T cells and so on, into therapies, both for mass applications as well as for personalized medicine (Stewart <em>et al.</em>, 2016).<br/> <br/>Assembling nanoparticles with different properties into a hybrid complex is a powerful strategy for developing novel functional materials, as these hybrid complexes exhibit collective and collaborative attributes, some of which might be different from those exhibited by the individual particles (Ghosh <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Virus nanoparticles representing a fascinating class of protein-polynucleotide supramolecular structures are an ideal natural resource to construct such hybrids. Considering different shapes and sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers and their documented ability for intracellular delivery, combining different viral building blocks into a multifunctional nanoparticle will greatly accelerate future therapies.<br/> <br/>Molecular and genetic analyses led to the engineering of an empty phage T4 shell (head or capsid) lacking the outer capsid proteins Soc (small outer capsid protein; 870 copies/head; 9 kDa) and Hoc (highly antigenic outer capsid protein; 155 copies/head; 41 kDa), neck, or tail as a delivery vehicle (Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Both Soc and Hoc are non-essential for phage infection and exhibit high binding affinity and specificity to T4 capsid surface. Soc binds as a trimer at the quasi three-fold axes whereas Hoc binds as a monomer at the center of each gp23 capsomer (hexamer). Foreign proteins can be efficiently displayed on T4 head through fusion to N and C termini of Soc or the N terminus of Hoc which are well exposed (Tao <em>et al.</em>, 2013).<br/> <br/>The 25 nm adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been extensively used as a gene delivery vehicle but it has a very small capacity and cannot deliver proteins. The 120 x 86 nm prokaryotic virus, the bacteriophage T4, on the other hand has a large capacity but it lacks natural mechanisms to enter human cells. It has no tropism to human cells, has no known toxicity or pathogenicity, and exhibits no preexisting immunity. We reported the development of the phage-virus hybrid vector by integrating these two most well-characterized delivery vehicles into one (Figure 1) (Zhu <em>et al.</em>, 2019). A specific biomolecular avidin-biotin interaction was selected as a driving force to mediate the interaction between the T4 head and AAV particle. It is also one of the strongest no-covalent interactions known in nature (Kd = 10<sup>-15</sup> M), making it ideal as a molecular bridge between the two nanoparticles (Jain and Cheng, 2017). We engineered it in such a way that all the different compartments of the T4-AAV nanoparticle could be utilized for loading cargo molecules. These include the interior of the T4 capsid shell that can accommodate 170 kbp of DNA cargo (Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2011), the interiors of attached AAV shells each accommodating 5 kbp of DNA cargo (Muzyczka, 2014), and the exterior of the T4 shell that can be decorated with up to 1,025 molecules of protein cargo (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Shivachandra <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Tao <em>et al.</em>, 2013 and 2018). This system has been optimized such that varieties of customized cargos can be prepared by simple mixing of interacting components that have nanomolar or sub-nanomolar affinities and by using a powerful DNA packaging motor (Leffers and Rao, 1996; Fuller <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Furthermore, different cargo molecules can be mixed and matched, quantified, and tuned as desired.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200326/20200326205754_5280.jpg" width="412"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Schematic of DNA &amp; protein carried T4 and T4-AAV hybrid vector</strong><br/> <br/>In this protocol, we describe the construction, expression, purification, and biotinylation of Soc and BAP-Hoc (BAP, Biotin Acceptor Peptide), and the assembly of Soc-biotin-avidin and Hoc-BAP-biotin-avidin. Soc and BAP-Hoc were biotinylated <em>in vitro</em> using biotin N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters and BirA ligase, respectively. NHS-activated biotins react efficiently with primary amino groups (-NH2) of Soc protein (the side chain of lysine residues and the N-terminus) to form stable amide bonds. BirA biotin ligase site-specifically biotinylates a lysine side chain within a 15-amino acid BAP peptide fused to the N terminus of Hoc protein. We also provide a description of the production, purification, and modification of AAV and T4 head. Finally, we describe the methodology for generating the hybrid T4-AAV particle using biotinylated AAV, T4 head, and the âlinkerâ molecules, Soc-biotin-avidin and Hoc-BAP-biotin-avidin (Figure 2). This protocol describes the assembly of hybrid T4-AAV vector in ~2 weeks. Although this study focused on T4 and AAV to conceptually demonstrate the utility of combining distinct viral building blocks, in a broader context, other hybrid vectors containing the T4 âcarrierâ complexed with eukaryotic viruses, bacteria, or polymers using bioaffinity attachment technology can be envisioned for delivery of multivalent gene and protein therapeutics (Akin <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Yoo <em>et al.</em>, 2011).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200326/20200326205912_0404.jpg" width="267"/><br/><strong>Figure 2. Workflow for construction of T4-Soc-AAV (A) and T4-Hoc-AAV (B) vectors.</strong> The T4 capsid lattice is decorated with two nonessential outer capsid proteins, Soc and Hoc. Soc and BAP-Hoc proteins were expressed in <em>E.coli</em>, purified by chromatography, and biotinylated. Two bridge molecules were constructed to attach AAV to the T4 head, Soc-biotin-avidin and Hoc-biotin acceptor peptide (BAP)-biotin-avidin. Soc and Hoc attach to the T4 head, and avidin attaches to biotinylated AAV (bioAAV) on the other side. T4-Soc-AAV (A) and T4-Hoc-AAV (B) conjugates were then purified by Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA agarose chromatography.</p>

Hence, the purified Soc protein was efficiently biotinylated by activation with NHS-biotin reagent, which was confirmed by Western blot using streptavidinâhorseradish peroxidase (HRP) against biotin (see Figures 2A and 2B in our original <em>Science Advances</em> research article) (Zhu <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</li><li>A biotin acceptor peptide BAP (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) was genetically fused to the N-terminus of T4 Hoc. Biotin ligase (BirA), which specifically recognizes a single lysine residue (L) in BAP, efficiently biotinylated BAP-Hoc protein in the presence of ATP and biotin (Schatz, 1993) (see Figures 3C and S1A in our original <em>Science Advances</em> research article). The ability of the modified BAP-Hoc to bind avidin indicated the biotinylation (see Figure S1B in our original <em>Science Advances</em> research article). Furthermore, the desired Hoc-avidin complex was finally purified by size-exclusion chromatography due to the significant molecular size difference between Hoc-avidin complex and other byproducts (see Figures S1C and S1D in our original <em>Science Advances</em> research article) (Zhu <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</li><li>Recombinant AAV-DJ vector was the chimera of a single type 2/type 8/type 9 and outperformed eight standard AAV serotypes in culture (Grimm <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Triple-plasmid transfection and HiTrap AVB Sepharose HP column or iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation were applied to produce and purify recombinant AAV-DJ vectors. The VP1, VP2, and VP3 subunits assemble into a complete 60-mer AAV capsid at a ratio of 1:1:10. VP subunits were labeled with biotin by the biotin-NHS reagent. Western blot using HRP-streptavidin indicated the presence of biotin conjugated to VP subunits in biotin-AAV-DJ vectors, while VP subunit bands were not detected in the unlabeled vectors (see Figures S3A and S3B in our original <em>Science Advances</em> research article) (Zhu <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</li><li>T4-Soc-Soc-Avidin or T4-HBBA particles were immobilized on a column of nickel beads through the hexa-histidine tag present at the terminus of Soc. This column allowed efficient capture of biotinylated AAV by the T4 Soc-avidin or HBBA bridge molecules and simultaneous removal of unbound AAV in the flow-through. The hybrid T4-AAV nanoparticles were finally eluted with imidazole and dialyzed against the PBS-MK buffer. The formation of T4-AAV nanoparticle was confirmed by western blot, the AAV amount in flow-through, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (see Figures 3 and S3 in our original <em>Science Advances</em> research article [Zhu <em>et al.</em>, 2019]).<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32583">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Mooreâs medium<br/>20 g tryptone<br/>15 gyeast extract<br/>8 g NaCl<br/>2 g dextrose<br/>2 g Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub><br/>1 g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><br/>Add MilliQ H<sub>2</sub>O to 1 L</li><li>1 M IPTG<br/>238 mg IPTG<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Add MilliQ H<sub>2</sub>O to 1 ml</li><li>Aliquot and store at -20 Â°C</li></ol></li><li>HisTrap binding buffer<br/>50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0<br/>300 mM NaCl<br/>20 mM imidazole<br/>Store at 4 Â°C</li><li>HisTrap elution buffer<br/>50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0<br/>300 mM NaCl<br/>400 mM imidazole<br/>Store at at 4 Â°C</li><li>Gel filtration buffer<br/>20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0<br/>100 mM NaCl<br/>Store at 4 Â°C</li><li>SDS-PAGE destaining solution<br/>400 ml methanol<br/>100 ml acetic acid<br/>800 ml MilliQ water</li><li>M9CA medium<br/>12.5 g M9CA medium powder<br/>Add MilliQ H<sub>2</sub>O to 1 L</li><li>PI-Mg buffer<br/>22 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><br/>70 mM NaCl<br/>1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub><br/>26 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> </li><li>Head binding buffer<br/>50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0<br/>5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub><br/>Store at 4 Â°C</li><li>Head elution buffer<br/>50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0<br/>5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub><br/>300 mM NaCl<br/>Store at 4 Â°C</li><li>DNA packaging buffer<br/>300 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5<br/>30 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub><br/>1 M NaCl<br/>10 mM ATP<br/>Store at -20 Â°C</li><li>PBS-MK buffer<br/>1x PBS (pH 7.4)<br/>1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>2.5 mM KCl<br/>Store at 4 Â°C</li><li>DMEM cell culture complete medium<br/>435 ml DMEM<br/>50 ml FBS<br/>10 ml 1 M HEPES<br/>5 ml 100x penicillin/streptomycin<br/>Store at 4 Â°C<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti32584">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This work was supported by NIAID/NIH grant AI111538, and in part by NIH grant AI081726 and NSF grant MCB-0923873 to V.B.R.
