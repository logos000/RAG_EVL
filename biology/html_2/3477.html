            <h1>Acute Isolation of Cells from Murine Sino-atrial Node</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Qadeer  Aziz, Muriel  Nobles, Andrew Tinker</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The cardiac conduction system allows the synchronized propagation of electrical activity through heart muscle. This is initiated by the spontaneous activity of the specialized pacemaker cells of the sino-atrial node (SAN). The SAN region underlies automaticity in mammals and therefore has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cardiac disorders such as arrhythmia. Isolation of SAN tissue and SAN cells is critical to advance our understanding of SAN structure and function in health and disease. Initially, isolation of SAN tissue and SAN cells was carried out in the rabbit owing to its larger size and similar electrical properties to human. This protocol was optimized by Mangoni and Nargeot (2001) for use in mice to take advantage of advancements in transgenic models. Here, we provide a step-by-step guide to dissecting the SAN tissue and isolating pacemaker cardiomyocytes from mouse hearts using an enzyme digestion approach.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Cardiovascular diseases and abnormalities are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and are major burden on healthcare systems. Arrhythmias as result of changes in the structure, rate and rhythm of the cardiac conduction system underlie many cardiac disorders. In the past, a lack of availability of homogenous conduction system cell lines has proven to be a hindrance to investigators wishing to study the function of conduction system cells in health and disease. The emergence of transgenic animal models of cardiac abnormalities provides an even greater impetus to reliably isolate healthy conduction system cells. Intact nodes allow investigations into expression profiles of important signaling proteins and genes using immunohistochemistry and qPCR approaches. More detailed functional analysis is possible on isolated single nodal cells using patch-clamp for example. The SAN tissue and the cells it consists of were first isolated many decades ago (Noble and Tsien, 1968). However, the cell population isolated was generally a mixed population. SAN specific cells were first isolated from rabbit SAN by DiFranscesco <em>et al.</em> (1986) in the mid-1980s to allow study of ion channel expression. More recently, the protocol was adapted for isolation of SAN cells from mice by Mangoni and Nargeot (2001). This has allowed transgenic mouse models specific to the SAN to be studied in greater detail. We describe the procedure for isolating the SAN tissue and single SAN cells. The intact node can be used for investigation of gene and protein expression as well as for tissue histology, whilst acutely isolated cells can be interrogated in detail for their electrophysiological properties.</p>

id="biaoti36316">### Procedure</p><p class="ppzz">The procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.<br/><em>Note: Stock solutions for dissection and isolation of the SAN can be prepared the day before isolation (Recipes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7) as it can take ~1 h to make them. Solutions should be kept in the fridge (~4-8 Â°C) and can be used for isolation for up to a week. For working solutions, such as the enzyme solution it is advisable to make on the day. All working solutions need to be pre-warmed (in a water bath) at 37 Â°C before use (~15-20 min). It is critical that CaCl</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em> (10 Âµl of 100 mM stock to 2.5 ml-final concentration 400 ÂµM) is added to the enzyme solution, otherwise tissue digestion will be compromised.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="133" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191225/20191225230410_2466.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

Coat coverslips with 1 Âµl of Laminin per coverslip and spread using a P200 tip and allow to dry in the culture hood with the lid off.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Heart removal from chest cavity<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Anesthetize mice with an intraperitoneal injection of Xylazine/Ketamine/Heparin mix (adhere to Institute guidelines).</li><li>Lay the mouse in the supine position (Figure 2) and spray the chest area with 70% ethanol. Open the chest cavity by cutting through the rib cage using dissecting scissors and remove the intact heart by holding it at the aortic arch with forceps and cutting just above the forceps using the student Vannas spring scissors. Do not worry about taking extra-cardiac tissue as this can be cleaned later. Rinse the heart in a beaker filled with Tyrode solution. Be careful not to cut/damage atrial appendage regions of the heart.</li><li>Place the heart, pinned at the apex with an insect pin on a dissection dish submerged with Tyrode solution. The heart should be placed as it would be in the mouse chest cavity (see Figure 2). Remove non-cardiac tissue such as lungs, thymus, connective tissue and fat under a microscope. Make a small incision in the ventricles using Vannas scissors and flush the heart of blood using a Pasteur pipette filled with Tyrode solution. Make sure to avoid air bubbles.</li></ol><em>Note: The mouse can be euthanized by cervical dislocation without anesthesia if one is careful not to crush the heart tissue. Heparin will prevent blood clots and make dissection/cleaning of the node easier. Tyrode solution used to rinse the heart can be at RT or pre-warmedâwe found no difference in the quality of tissue isolated between the two conditions.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="119" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191225/20191225230438_9176.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

IAS, intra-atrial septum.<br/><br/></li><li>SAN dissection<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Under the microscope, carefully make a horizontal incision using students Vannas scissors at the junction between the ventricles and atria (see Figure 2). The ventricles should stop beating and can be discarded. The upper chambers with the atrial appendages and conduction tissue should continue to beat.</li><li>Flip the atrial/conduction tissue so that the aorta is facing you with the right atria on your left side.</li><li>Using insect pins carefully pin the atrial/conduction tissue in a clean Sylgard dissection dish (Recipe 9) containing Tyrode solution (see Figure 2). Place pins strategically on the left and right atria, on the edges of the aorta (see Figure 2) or superior vena cava and inferior vena cava (if present). Do not over-stretch the tissue. Carefully remove the remaining ventricular tissue, if necessary, using fine Vannas scissors.</li><li>Once the tissue is free of ventricular muscle, cut open the right atrial appendage pocket and re-pin to reveal the Cristae terminalis (CT). The SAN (transparent) will be clearly visible between the inter-atrial septum and the cristae terminalis (see Figure 2).</li><li>Carefully remove any fat/connective tissue from beneath the SAN.</li><li>Finally, carefully cut the SAN with fine Vannas scissors and, transfer to a Pyrex tube containing pre-warmed low Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution with fine forceps.</li></ol><em>Note: The superior and inferior vena cava are not always seen in every preparation, however the aorta should be visible and is ideal to pin at the top. The bottom end can be easily pinned using connective tissue or part of the right and left atrial appendages. When cleaning the tissue use sharp forceps (with no hooks) and curved Vannas scissors, these allow you to cut away from the tissue and prevent damage to the node. It is especially important to be careful when cleaning the underside of the nodal tissue. To do this as thoroughly as possible it may be necessary to unpin the bottom end (or top end) and flip to allow easier access. The node will generally continue to beat for a prolonged period of time (~10-20 min)âthis can be important when dissecting for the first few attempts because it allows visualization of the area of interest. If the node stops beating, it can be restarted by gently pipetting fresh Tyrode solution on to it.</em><br/><br/></li><li>Enzyme digestion of SAN tissue (see the schematic Figure 1)<br/>All solutions should be pre-warmed at 37 Â°C in a water bath.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Place the SAN tissue into a pre-prepared Pyrex tube containing low Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution. Incubate for 2 min at 37 Â°C (in the water bath). Using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette carefully transfer the tissue in to the second low Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> tube for a further 4 min.</li><li>Transfer the SAN tissue in to the enzyme solution for 10-15 min at 37 Â°C. Agitate manually every 2-3 min with a fire polished Pasteur pipette. The tissue should start to look less structurally rigid.</li><li>Wash the tissue 4 times in the KB solution. The first 3 washes should be for 2 min followed by a fourth and final wash for 4 min.</li><li>Transfer the tissue and KB solution from the final wash to a 5 or 10 ml glass vial. Gently triturate (pipette up and down) the tissue with an appropriately sized (see Notes) fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette for ~30-60 s, avoiding air bubbles. Allow the cell suspension to rest at room temperature for 5 min.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Re-adaptation of SAN cells<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Transfer the triturated cell suspension to a 15 ml Falcon tube.</li><li>Cumulatively add the following volumes of the NaCl/CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution (Recipe 5) to the Falcon tube containing the cell suspension and place on the rocking platform.<br/>25 Âµl for 4 min<br/>50 Âµl for 4 min<br/>70 Âµl for 4 min<br/>90 Âµl for 4 min</li><li>Add 360 Âµl of Tyrode-BSA (Recipe 6) to the cell suspension and place on the rocker for 4 min.</li><li>Centrifuge the cell suspension at ~60-70 <em>x g</em> for 7 min. There should be a small pellet of cells.</li><li>Carefully remove 2-2.2 ml of the supernatant using a 1 ml Gilson Pipetman (~0.8-1 ml supernatant should remain).</li><li>Gently re-suspend the pellet of cells in the remaining supernatant using 1 ml Gilson Pipetman and place roughly an equal amount (~60-80 Âµl) on the pre-prepared laminin coated coverslip (within a 12-well culture plate). Incubate the plate at 37 Â°C (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) cell culture incubator for ~30-45 min to allow cells to adhere to the coverslips.</li><li>Check cells under the microscope (using the 20x objective) to see if cells are viableâcells should. Add 1 ml/well of pre-warmed storage solution (Recipe 7) or Tyrode-BSA. Cells are now ready to use.<br/>Morphologically SAN cells consist of 3 types: Spindle-shaped, spider-like and elongated (see Figure 3).<br/><em>Note: We found that placing the cells in Tyrode-BSA was just as effective as placing them in storage solution. The number of total cells can be very variable depending on the success of the preparation, however on average we expect to see ~100-120 (5-10 per coverslip) viable cells per preparation.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="116" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200101/20200101181236_5651.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.
