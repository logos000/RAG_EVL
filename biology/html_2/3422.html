            <h1>Isolation and Culture of Murine Hepatic Stellate Cells</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rucha V. Modak, Dietmar M. Zaiss</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), alternatively known as liver pericytes, can differentiate into myofibroblasts and secrete extra-cellular matrix components, thereby promoting wound healing and fibrosis. Studying HSCs can provide insights into the pathological mechanisms governing these processes. HSC isolation methods typically comprise of enzymatic digestion followed by density gradient centrifugation and/or Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) mediated sorting. In this protocol, we describe a step-wise method for HSC isolation that utilizes Pronase and Collagenase for enzymatic tissue dissociation, followed by an Optiprep based density gradient centrifugation. The isolation can be performed using common media and buffers, and without the use of any special equipment for liver perfusion and HSC isolation. The technique yields <em>ex vivo</em> HSCs, suitable for use in assays.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) harbor in the perisinusoidal space amidst the endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Under homeostatic conditions, HSCs assume a quiescent state comprising about 15% of the liver resident cells (Friedman, 2008). Upon activation, HSCs can differentiate into myofibroblasts producing copious amount of extra-cellular matrix components, such as collagen. <br/><br/>Originally, rat livers were utilized for HSC isolation during the 1980s (Knook <em>et al</em>., 1982; Friedman <em>et al</em>., 1985). Owing to the ability of quiescent HSCs to store vitamin A in lipid droplets, isolation was based on density gradient separation. On similar lines, vitamin A rich mouse HSCs localize in the upper layers in density gradients (Chang <em>et al</em>., 2014, Maschmeyer <em>et al</em>., 2011). Subsequently developed FACS based methods explore the inherent vitamin A fluorescence to sort HSCs (Mederacke <em>et al</em>., 2015).<br/><br/>Our method was implemented in our recent studies on pericyte induced wound healing (Minutti <em>et al</em>., 2019) and is advantageous as a rapid, inexpensive method to yield around 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> HSCs and takes about 3.5 h. HSCs isolated using our method can be used in gene expression studies, <em>in vitro</em> differentiation assays and can be applied to wild type as well as genetically modified mice.</p>
