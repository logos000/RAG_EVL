            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Mammalian embryonic development starts with a single fertilized zygote that develops into a blastocyst embryo consisting of three cell types that evolve into either embryonic or extra-embryonic tissues. Lineage tracing of these cells can provide important information about the molecular and cellular dynamics contributing to fate allocation during early development. While global labeling techniques allow for visualization of all cells at the same time, lineage tracing of cells over several divisions can become complicated due to embryo movement and rotation as well as increasing cell densities. Here, we use green-to-red photoconvertible proteins for both global and sparse labeling of cells of interest in the developing murine embryo. We use primed conversion to achieve precise photoconversion of single nuclei in 4-cell stage embryos followed by volumetric live imaging to capture development up to the blastocyst stage. We developed an image analysis pipeline, called <em>primed Track</em>, that uses the dual labeling strategy for both straightforward segmentation and registration of all cells in the embryo as well as correction of rotational and spatial drift. Together, this strategy allows for reliable and fast tracking and lineage tracing of individual cells, even over increased imaging time intervals that result in a major reduction in data volume, all essential conditions for volumetric long-term imaging techniques.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The first lineages of mammalian development are specified within the first days after fertilization before the embryo adheres to the wall of the uterus during implantation (Welling <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Still, how and when these first specialized cell types appear and which molecular mechanisms are responsible for symmetry breaking from an initially homogeneous set of cells, remains largely unknown. Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) provides a unique means for capturing developmental progression of living samples for several consecutive days in a non-invasive manner (Strnad <em>et al.</em>, 2016; McDole <em>et al.</em>, 2018). However, a large fraction of mammalian pre-implantation embryos shows significant spatial and rotational drift, which makes it difficult to track individual cells over time and often results in the exclusion of these embryos from the analysis (Strnad <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Welling <em>et al.</em>, 2019). While increased imaging rates could help address this challenge, this approach requires additional data storage space and could result in increased chances of photodamage making it a less attractive solution for sensitive specimen like mammalian embryos.<br/><br/>The introduction of fluorescent proteins (FPs) as genetic labels transformed biological and developmental imaging due to their ease of use in conventional imaging platforms. Compared to previous common cell labelling methods, such as vital dyes (Vogt, 1925) and interspecies transplantations (Honig and Hume, 1989), FPs can be easily introduced into different cell types and can provide specific and indelible labelling when stably expressed. Furthermore, the use of tissue- or cell-specific promoters to drive expression of FPs increases contrast for lineage tracing and can reveal important information about cellular identity (Baier <em>et al.</em>, 1996).<br/><br/>A subclass of FPs, called photomodifiable FPs, is of particular interest because they can change their spectral properties (<em>i.e.</em>, excitation and emission spectra) upon violet (405 nm) or ultraviolet (UV) light illumination. For example, the photoactivatable GFP, paGFP (Patterson and Lippincott-Schwartz, 2002), can permanently change from a non- or weak fluorescent state to a strongly fluorescent one upon violet or UV light illumination, while the photoconvertible FP Dendra2 can change from a green fluorescent state to a red one (Gurskaya <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Photoconvertible FPs offer the advantage of being able to visualize both global and sparse cell populations and therefore provide a powerful resource of cell tracking and lineage tracing of cell populations in living samples (Dempsey <em>et al.</em>, 2012). However, until recently labelling using photoconvertible FPs has not been used in live volumetric imaging studies due to the potential phototoxicity of conventional 405nm light and its inherent inability to confine axially photoconversion.<br/><br/>In 2015, we (Dempsey <em>et al.</em>, 2015) reported a new photoconversion method, called primed conversion. We showed that Dendra2 can be successfully photoconverted from green to red by simultaneous illumination with 488 nm and 730 nm light. In contrast to conventional 405 nm photoconversion, primed conversion allows for precise conversion of small volumes in 3D space; conversion occurs only in the defined volume in which the two beams (488 nm and 730 nm) intersect, enabling labelling of single cells and/or subcellular compartments in very dense 3D environments (Dempsey <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Mohr <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Mohr and Pantazis, 2016). As primed conversion uses lower energy light than 405 nm photoconversion, it is less phototoxic. Recently, studies have demonstrated that primed conversion can be also achieved using conventional red lasers (630-690 nm) found in most commercial fluorescence microscopes (Klementieva <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Mohr <em>et al.</em>, 2017). This work also revealed the basic principle of the primed conversion mechanism (Mohr <em>et al.</em>, 2017); the acquired knowledge was used to render most known green-to-red photoconvertible proteins primed convertible (pr-FPs) (Mohr <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Turkowyd <em>et al.</em>, 2017) (see <a href="https://www.addgene.org/Periklis_Pantazis/" target="_blank">https://www.addgene.org/Periklis_Pantazis/</a>). Out of these, we have selected pr-mEosFP with high brightness and photostability as the optimal photoconvertible protein for our imaging experiments in living mouse embryos (Welling <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>Here we show that confined primed conversion of green-to-red photoconvertible proteins in combination with volumetric long term imaging of murine pre-implantation embryos allows for tracking of individual cells with high fidelity during development up to the blastocyst stage (Welling <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Taking advantage of both the global green and sparse red labels, we have developed an image analysis pipeline, called <em>primed Track</em>, for registration and computational correction of observed spatial and rotational drift during development, facilitating segmentation and reliable reconstruction of lineage trees with minimal tracking uncertainties (Welling <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In addition, the dual labeling approach combined with <em>primed Track</em> allows for accurate tracking of specimen imaged with larger time intervals, which reduces photodamage in sensitive samples and decreases the amount of data produced. Finally, primed Track is not limited to pre-implantation embryos with photoconvertible labels but can also be generally used to facilitate tracking and lineage tracing in other types of dual-labelled living samples, such as organoids.</p>

Therefore, different primed conversion parameters need to be tested in order to define the optimal settings for your cells of interest; <em>i.e.</em>, the intensities of the priming beam and conversion beam, and the duration of conversion. In our experience, the laser intensities used for the priming beam (488 nm) has the greatest influence on the conversion efficiency. We recommend to keep the 488 nm laser intensity as low as possible for primed conversion to still take place in order to minimize loss of fluorescent signal due to bleaching. This is of particular importance for samples exhibiting low fluorescence intensities prior to photoconversion. In our hands a conversion duration of ~20 s results in a good tradeoff between conversion efficiency and limited bleaching. For samples that exhibit high levels of expression of photoconvertible proteins, a longer conversion time may be required to obtain better photoconversion efficiencies.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34251">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">MW is supported by a Rubicon postdoctoral fellowship from the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and a postdoctoral fellowship from the Peter und Traudl Engelhorn Stiftung.
