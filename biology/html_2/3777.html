            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The study of food addiction comprises 3 hallmarks that include the persistence to response without an outcome, the strong motivation for palatable food, and the loss of inhibitory control over food intake that leads to compulsive behavior in addicted individuals. The complex multifactorial nature of this disorder and the unknown neurobiological mechanistic correlation explains the lack of effective treatments. Our operant conditioning model allows deciphering why some individuals are vulnerable and develop food addiction while others are resilient and do not. It is a translational approach since it is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) and the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS 2.0). This model allows to evaluate the addiction criteria in 2 time-points at an early and a late period by grouping them into 1) persistence to response during a period of non-availability of food, 2) motivation for food with a progressive ratio, and 3) compulsivity when the reward is associated with a punishment such as an electric foot-shock. The advantage of this model is that it allows us to measure 4 phenotypic traits suggested as predisposing factors related to vulnerability to addiction. Also, it is possible to evaluate the long food addiction mouse model with mice genetically modified. Importantly, the novelty of this protocol is the adaptation of this food addiction model to a short protocol to evaluate genetic manipulations targeting specific brain circuitries by using a chemogenetic approach that could promote the rapid development of this addictive behavior. These adaptations lead to a short food addiction mouse protocol, in which mice follow the same behavioral procedure of the early period in the long food addiction protocol with some variations due to the surgical viral vector injection. To our knowledge, there is no paradigm in mice allowing us to study the combination of such a robust behavioral approach that allows uncovering the neurobiology of food addiction at the brain circuit level. We can study using this protocol if modifying the excitability of a specific brain network confers resilience or vulnerability to developing food addiction. Understanding these neurobiological mechanisms is expected to help to find novel and efficient interventions to battle food addiction.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>In the last years, food addiction has gained attention due to the increasing prevalence worldwide (19.9 %) and currently represents a high cost to the individual and the society without any effective treatment available (Pursey <em>et al.</em>, 2014). The current diagnosis is performed by a recently validated tool, the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (YFAS 2.0). This instrument is based on the criteria applied in the 5th edition of the Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) for substance use disorders, taking into account the increasing evidence suggesting that food addiction shares its neurobiological substrates with drug addiction (Lindgren<em> et al.</em>, 2017). Food addiction is a complex multifactorial brain disorder resulting from the dynamic interaction among multiple gene networks and multiple environmental factors impacting brain development and function, leading to individual differences among the population (Hamer, 2002; Nestler <em>et al.</em>, 2015). For this reason, not all individuals become addicted and extreme subpopulations can be distinguished with an addicted and non-addicted phenotype (Piazza and Deroche-Gamonet, 2013). Conversely, the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying both phenotypes are still unclear despite the well-known common brain areas involved in addictive processes that include the basal ganglia, extended amygdala, and prefrontal cortex (Koob and Volkow, 2016; Moore <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The current protocol improves previous studies because it has the inclusion of a short protocol for evaluating food addiction phenotype in genetically modified mice that present anticipation of food addiction development. In this protocol, the development of loss of control over food intake that characterizes addiction is revealed by measuring compulsivity, motivation, and persistence in different time-points. Compared to other operant models, this has the advantage of measuring other phenotypic traits such as impulsivity, cognitive flexibility, appetitive associative learning, and aversive conditioning. These traits are potential predictors of the development of food addiction. In this study, the main aim is to describe a replicable protocol that allows deciphering the neurobiological mechanisms involved in the resilient and vulnerable phenotypes to develop a food addiction. To address this major question, we describe a protocol with a reliable behavioral approach that can be adapted to combine a viral vector approach with chemogenetic manipulations. These findings will help to design new strategies to focus the strength in the prevention of the transition to food addiction by increasing the inhibitory control of individuals exposed to unhealthy environmental conditions.<br/></p>

Pressing on the active lever results in a food pellet delivery paired with a stimulus-light (associated-cue, #ENV-321M, Med Associates), located above the active lever, and while pressing on the inactive lever has no consequences. A food dispenser (#ENV-303M pellet receptacle, #ENV-203M-20, modular pellet dispenser, Med Associates) equidistant between the two levers permit the delivery of food pellets when required. The floor of the chambers is a grid floor (#ENV-307A-GF, Med Associates) that serves to deliver electric foot shocks in the session of shock test and serves as a contextual cue in the session of shock-induced suppression the day after the shock test. During the rest of the self-administration sessions, a metal sheet with holes is placed above the grid floor. Thus, mice can discriminate between different contexts. A house light is placed on the ceiling of the chamber (#ENV-315M, Med Associates). The chambers are made of aluminum and acrylic and are housed in sound- and light-attenuated boxes equipped with fans to provide ventilation and white noise.

Mice are tested during the dark phase of a reverse light cycle (lights off at 8.00 a.m and on at 8.00 p.m).</p><ol class="npwone"><li>Self-administration session<br/>The beginning of each self-administration session is signaled by turning on a house light placed on the ceiling of the chamber during the first 3 s. Daily self-administration sessions maintained by chocolate-flavored pellets last 1 h in the long food addiction protocol and 2 h in the short food addiction protocol to increase the exposure of the palatable pellets on each day to ensure the development of the addiction-like phenotype. The self-administration sessions are composed of 2 pellet periods (25 min and 55 min) separated by a pellet-free period (10 min). During the pellet periods, pellets are delivered contingently after an active response paired with a stimulus light (cue light). A time-out period of 10 s is established after each pellet delivery, where the cue light is off, and no reinforcer is provided after responding on the active lever. Responses on the active lever and all the responses performed during the time-out period are recorded. During the pellet-free period, no pellet is delivered, and this period is signaled by the illumination of the entire self-administration chamber. After each session, mice are returned to their home cages.<br/>  In the operant conditioning sessions, mice are under a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement (1 lever-press results in one pellet delivery) followed by an increased F.R. to 5 (FR5) (5 lever-presses results in 1 pellet delivery) for the rest of the sessions. As previously described (MartÃ­n-GarcÃ­a <em>e</em><em>t al.</em>, 2011), the criteria for the achievement of the operant responding are acquired when all of the following conditions are met: (1) mice maintained a stable responding with less than 20% deviation from the mean of the total number of reinforcers earned in 3 consecutive sessions (80% of stability); (2) at least 75% responding on the active lever; and (3) a minimum of 5 reinforcers per session.</li><br/><li>Measurement of the 3 food addiction-like criteria<br/>Three behavioral tests are used to evaluate the food addiction-like criteria as described (Mancino <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Domingo-Rodriguez<em> et al.</em>, 2020) and adapted from cocaine addiction-like in rats (Deroche-Gamonet<em> et al</em>., 2004). These 3 criteria summarize the hallmarks of addiction based on DSM-IV (Piazza and Deroche-Gamonet, 2013), specified in DSM-5, and now included in the food addiction diagnosis through the YFAS 2.0 (Gearhardt<em> et al.</em>, 2016).<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Persistence to response (Figure 2A): Non-reinforced active responses during the pellet free period (10 min), when the box is illuminated and signaling the unavailability of pellet delivery, are measured as persistence of food-seeking behavior. On the 3 consecutive days before the progressive ratio, mice are scored.</li><li>Motivation (Figure 2B): The progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement is used to evaluate the motivation for chocolate-flavored pellets. The response required to earn one single pellet escalates according to the following series: 1, 5, 12, 21, 33, 51, 75, 90, 120, 155, 180, 225, 260, 300, 350, 410, 465, 540, 630, 730, 850, 1,000, 1,200, 1,500, 1,800, 2,100, 2,400, 2,700, 3,000, 3,400, 3,800, 4,200, 4,600, 5,000, and 5,500. The maximal number of responses that the animal performs to obtain one pellet is the last event completed, referred to as the breaking point. The maximum duration of the progressive ratio session is 5 h or until mice do not respond on any lever within 1 h.</li><li>Compulsivity (Figure 2C): Total number of shocks in the session of shock test (50 min), when each pellet delivered is associated with punishment, are used to evaluate compulsivity-like behavior, previously described as resistance to punishment (Deroche-Gamonet <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Mancino <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Mice are placed in a self-administration chamber without the metal sheet with holes and, consequently, with the grid floor exposed (contextual cue). In this shock-session, mice are under an FR5 schedule of reinforcement during 50 min with 2 schedule changes: at the 4<sup>th</sup> active lever-response mice receive only an electric foot-shock (0.18 mA, 2 s) without pellet delivery, and at the 5<sup>th </sup>active lever-response, mice receive another electric foot-shock with a chocolate-flavored pellet paired with the cue light. The schedule is reinitiated after 10 s pellet delivery (time-out period) and after the 4<sup>th</sup> response if mice do not perform the 5<sup>th</sup> response within 1 min.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="350" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200920/20200920230637_0930.jpeg" width="503"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

Four mice (A-D) are indicated in the figure as an example. Mouse A presents the values of each criterion below the threshold achieving 0 criteria and is classified as a non-addicted animal. Mouse B displays a score in persistence to the response above the threshold and below in motivation and compulsivity, achieving 1 criterion and is classified as a non-addicted animal. Mouse C shows a score in persistence to response and compulsivity above the threshold and below in motivation achieving 2 criteria and is categorized as an addicted animal. Mouse D shows a score of each criterion above the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile achieving 3 criteria and is classified as an addicted animal.

The short protocol lasts 9 weeks. In the 1<sup>st</sup> week, mice are trained to acquire the operant conditioning maintained by chocolate-flavored pellets under FR1 (2 sessions) and FR5 (2 sessions) schedules of reinforcement. In the 2<sup>nd</sup> week, the viral vector of interest is injected in mice by stereotaxic surgery.<br/><strong>Examples of viral vectors strategies:</strong><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li><strong>Chemogenetic approach (DREADD approach):</strong> It refers to the injection of Cre-dependent AAV carrying a DREADD in a determined brain region of genetically modified mice expressing the Cre-recombinase in a specific cell-type.</li><li><strong>Combined chemogenetic and a retrograde AAV approach (retro-DREADD approach):</strong> It refers to the combinatorial injection of Cre-dependent AAV carrying a DREADD in a determined brain region and an AAV retrograde expressing the Cre-recombinase in its projecting brain area to target a specific network in wild type mice.<br/>After bilateral intracranial injection/s of the viral vector/s, the expression of the viral vector/s is allowed during the period of 4 weeks (2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd,</sup> 4<sup>th</sup>, and the 5<sup>th</sup> week). At the beginning of this period (3<sup>rd</sup> week), mice are under FR5 (4 sessions) to recover the basal levels of operant responding. At the end of these 4 weeks (5<sup>th</sup> week), an osmotic minipump filled with CNO or saline is subcutaneously implanted in the back of each mouse.
