            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix assemblies of highly negatively charged proteoglycans that wrap around fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons in the cerebral cortex. PNNs play important roles in neuronal plasticity and modulate biophysical properties of the enclosed interneurons. Various central nervous system diseases including schizophrenia, Alzheimer disease and epilepsy present with qualitative alteration in PNNs, however prior studies failed to quantitatively assess such changes at single PNN level and correlate them with functional changes in disease. We describe a method to quantify the structural integrity of PNNs using high magnification image analysis of Wisteria Floribunda Agglutinin (WFA)-labeled PNNs in combination with cell-type-specific marker such as PV and NeuN. A polyline intensity profile of WFA along the entire perimeter of cell shows alternate segments with and without WFA labeling, indicating the intact chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) and holes of PNN respectively. This line intensity profile defines CSPG peaks, where intact PNN is present, and CSPG valleys (holes) where the PNN is missing. The average number of peaks reflect the integrity of the lattice assembly of PNN. The average size of PNN holes can be readily computed using image analysis software. Furthermore, degradation of PNNs using a bacterial-derived enzyme, Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), allows to experimentally manipulate PNNs <em>in situ</em> brain slices during which biophysical properties can be assessed by patch-clamp recordings. We describe optimized experimental parameters to degrade PNNs in brain slices before as well as during recordings to study the possible change in function in real time. Our protocols provide effective and appropriate methods to modulate and quantify the PNNâs experimental manipulations.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The extracellular spaces of the central nervous system are filled by an amorphous interstitial matrix that is composed of dense network of proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid (HA), tenascins and link proteins, and is contiguous with well-organized lattice-like structures called PNNs that enclose the somata, axons and dendrites of PV expressing interneurons in the cerebral cortex (HÃ¤rtig <em>et al.</em>, 1999). The lattice of PNNs is composed of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), HA, tenascins, various link proteins (Deepa <em>et al.</em>, 2006), <em>etc</em>. Owing to the high density of sulfated proteoglycans, PNNs are highly negatively charged (Morawski <em>et al.</em>, 2015). The development of PNN coincides with the closure of ocular dominance critical period and studies have shown reinstatement of ocular dominance plasticity upon removal of the PNNs thereby suggesting inhibitory role of PNNs on neuronal plasticity (Pizzorusso <em>et al.</em>, 2002). PNNs are also suggested to modulate the biophysical properties PV interneurons (Balmer, 2016, Favuzzi <em>et al.</em>, 2017, Tewari <em>et al.</em>, 2018), and are prone to degradation by ECM remodeling enzymes. Most notably, under pathological conditions including epilepsy (McRae <em>et al.</em>, 2012, Rankin-Gee <em>et al.</em>, 2015, Dubey <em>et al.</em>, 2017, Tewari <em>et al.</em>, 2018, Patel <em>et al.</em>, 2019), schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease (Testa <em>et al.</em>, 2018) ECM remodeling is common. <br/><br/>One of the major challenges in reporting on the status of PNNs is the quantification of the structural integrity of their lattice-like assembly. Essentially all published studies use the CSPG binding lectin, WFA, as non-specific PNN marker to visualize PNNs, and use WFA intensity to quantify the overall CSPG levels without detailed analysis of individual PNNâs architecture (Slaker <em>et al.</em>, 2015 and 2016, LensjÃ¸ <em>et al.</em>, 2017, Ueno <em>et al.</em>, 2018). We developed a method to quantify the structural integrity of individual PNNs using high-magnification fluorescence imaging. This method also minimizes the errors due to procedure-related variations in the WFA intensity. After acquiring multichannel high magnification images (40x objective lens with 5 digital zoom) of individual PNNs, a polyline is drawn around the periphery of the cell. The fluorescence intensity of WFA along this line shows a discrete pattern of peaks separated by low-intensity valleys. Each peak represents the continuous CSPG and the gap between the two consecutive peaks represent a hole in the PNN (Tewari <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The average number of peaks and average width of holes can be derived from the WFA intensity data points and are reflective of the PNNâs structural integrity. The peaks in the line profile can be counted manually or by using clampfit program (Molecular Devices).<br/><br/>A vast majority of studies, which explore the function of PNNs and their influence on the neuronal physiology, use ChABC, which is a bacterial enzyme that cleaves the chondroitin sulfate side chains thereby dismantling the PNN assembly (Dityatev <em>et al.</em>, 2007, Balmer, 2016, Testa <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The most common approach in such studies involves degradation of PNN <em>in-vivo</em>/<em>in-situ</em> brain slices/primary cultures and studying the function afterward by comparing two different populations of samples. However, it would be advantageous to record from PNN bearing neurons during the real-time degradation of PNNs to evaluate the physiological role of PNN on neuronal function. Such studies are largely absent in the literature. Here, we report two variants of experimental PNN degradation in the brain slices, which reliably degrade PNNs to allow studying their function. The first variant includes degradation of PNNs by incubating brain slices with ChABC in an incubation chamber followed by performing experiments to compare their properties with non-treated controls. The other variant is to study the baseline physiology in the presence of intact PNNs followed by superfusing ChABC solution and recording the functional activity during and after PNN depletion in the experimental set-up. Both the variants involve controlled degradation of PNNs and identifiable traces of degraded PNNs around the cells can be observed to confirm the presence/absence of PNNs on the experimental cell/tissue after post-experimental WFA staining of the samples. These methods provide unparalleled advantages to study the physiological functions associate with the PNNs.</p>

To determine the size of the biggest hole in the PNN, measure the distance between two consecutive peaks that appear to be farthest from each other (white double-headed arrows in lower panels in Figures 1A-1B). (Alternately, plot the data in Clampfit result window and save it as an .atf file. Open this file later and use the peak detection function to count the number of peaks. The parameters of peak detection function may detect few false peaks, which can be removed from the analysis. In addition, placing two cursers covering the gap and remarking the distance between them can be used to determine the size of the largest hole.)<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190513/20190513224750_7537.jpg" width="156"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

In case of PNN degradation in experimental setup (Procedure C), only the top or exposed surface of slice shows the degradation effect of ChABC (Figure 4D). The high magnification images (20x) show faint outline of PNNs around the PNN expressing neurons (Inset image in Figure 4D). In case of whole cell patch clamp experiments, a traces dye can also be added to the pipette buffer to label the recorded cell, and presence of faint WFA outline around the recorded cells suggests that cells expressed PNN before the ChABC-treatment (Tewari <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190513/20190513224909_0712.jpg" width="136"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.
