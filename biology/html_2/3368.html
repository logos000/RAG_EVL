            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Studying protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions in their native environment is highly desirable, yet, the heterogeneity and complexity of cellular systems limits the repertoire of experimental methods available. In cells, interactions are often taking place in confined microenvironments where factors such as avidity, hindered diffusion, reduced dimensionality, crowding <em>etc</em>. strongly influence the binding kinetics and therefore it can be problematic to equate binding affinities obtained by bulk in-solution methods (<em>e.g.</em>, Fluorescence Polarization, Isothermal titration calorimetry, Microscale thermophoresis) with those occurring in real cellular environments. The Supported Cell Membrane Sheet method presented here, addresses these issues by allowing access to the inner leaflet of the apical plasma membrane. The method is a highly versatile, near-native platform for both qualitative and quantitative studies of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions occurring directly in or on the plasma membrane.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Proper evaluation of the binding strength between biomolecules is pivotal for understanding cellular pathways and for rational drug development. The general understanding of both the dynamics and kinetics of biomolecular interactions often relies on experimental approaches where single protein domains of interest are isolated from their native cellular environment and tested under conditions that may deviate significantly from the specific cellular compartment in which they actually occur. In cells, various microenvironments containing a wealth of different proteins, protein-polymers, and lipid membranes with diverse properties and shapes, can contribute to anisotropic concentrations, reduced dimensionality and diffusion rates, all of which greatly affect the binding strength. <br/><br/> Supported Cell Membrane Sheets (SCMS) are ideal for studying interactions occurring on (or in) the native cytoplasmic cell membrane. SCMS are prepared from cultured adherent cells by firmly attaching a cover glass on top of cultured cells and subsequently separating the apical plasma membrane from the cells by lifting the cover glass. This exposes the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane for binding of fluorescently labeled ligands which can then be studied by microscopy (Figure 1). <br/><br/> The method was originally developed by Perez <em>et al.</em> (2006), to qualitatively investigate the mobility of GPCRs and their association to G-proteins, and has also been used for both FRET based stoichiometry (Miles <em>et al.</em>, 2013) and super resolution microscopy based cluster analysis (Scarselli <em>et al.</em>, 2012). A related study by Roizard <em>et al.</em> (2011) also managed to produce supported cell membrane sheets on porous beads (~80 Î¼m in diameter) leaving both the intracellular and the solvent exposed extracellular side of the membrane accessible. <br/><br/> Here, we have adapted the SCMS method for also measuring protein-protein binding affinities, which is particularly useful in cases where one or more interaction partners are membrane bound or embedded. The method is highly applicable for studying scaffolding protein where several interaction domains in one protein, formation of higher order structures and direct interaction with the lipid membrane may induce significant avidity effects improving the effective binding strengths and change kinetics by several orders of magnitude. Please use Erlendsson <em>et al.</em> (2019) as a practical and theoretical case study.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="197" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190915/20190915051426_1755.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. General principle for preparation of Supported Cell Membrane Sheets.</strong> A. SCMS are prepared from transfected HEK293 Grip Tite cells. The membrane protein is labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 in this case (green). Pressing a coated glass coverslip onto the cells and subsequently removing it, will detach the apical plasma membrane from the remains of the cells, and leave the inner leaflet exposed for binding experiments. B. A closer schematic view of the principle. The Antibody labeling can be replaced with a fluorescent protein. Figures are adapted from Erlendsson <em>et al.</em> (2019).</p>

Protein labeling<br/>The protein used for the binding studies below should be pure and stable at concentrations 10x above the expected K<sub>D</sub> for at least 1 day at 10 Â°C after purification. In our experiments, we purify and label a new batch of protein for each independent experimental repetition. As maleimide or NHS labeling might interfere with membrane binding, we suggest using SNAP-tagged constructs for the initial binding studies. We use an N-terminal GST-SNAP-tag with a thrombin cleavage site between the GST and SNAP tag.<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>For labeling of GST tagged protein (concentration should be 2-4 mg/ml and volume around 1 ml) bound to roughly 500 Î¼l Glutathione-sepharose bead slurry (Total volume ~1500 Î¼l), add SNAP-surface dye (2.5 mM stock in DMSOâuse concentrations of 10-20 Î¼M final concentration for labeling) and incubate for two hours at 4 Â°C. The beads/protein/dye slurry can be contained in a PD-10 column.</li><li>After labeling, excess dye is removed by simply washing the labeled protein beads on the column. Use 5-10 bead volumes TBS buffer (or similar) for complete removal of free dye. Leave in at least 3 bead volumes of TBS buffer (or similar).</li><li>You can now add your protease (in our case thrombin ~5 U) to the stained protein (~2-4 mg) still attached on the beads and leave at gentle agitation at 4 Â°C until cleavedâovernight (10-16 h are usually sufficient for complete cleavage).</li><li>Elute the cleaved and stained protein from the beads using gravity flow, and centrifuge samples at 100,000 <em>x g</em> for 1 h to remove all potential aggregates. When the centrifugation of the protein is done supernatants are immediately moved to clean tubes on ice for determination of protein concentration and labeling degree. <br/><br/></li></ol>A2. Antibody labeling<br/>Primary dye conjugation of antibodies is performed using Invitrogen Alexa Fluor<sup>TM</sup> NHS Ester (Succinimidyl Ester) dyes and monoclonal ANTI-FLAG<sup>Â®</sup> M1 antibody produced in mouse. In principle the dyes and antibody (if you have other tags on your protein) can be fitted to your needs and microscope setup).<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Dilute antibody stock to 1 Î¼g/Î¼l in a total volume of 100 Î¼lâuse PBS buffer (no Tris or other buffer containing free amines).</li><li>Add 10 Î¼l 1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> to ensure alkaline reaction conditions.</li><li>Dissolve ~200 Î¼g dye (standard aliquot amount from manufacturer) in the 110 Î¼l alkaline antibody solution, then wrap tube in Alufoil and incubate at 4 Â°C under slow agitation overnight.</li><li>Next day, equilibrate Nap-5 gel filtration columns using PBS buffer (three column volumes).<br/></li><li>Bring the reaction volume up to 200 Î¼l with PBS (add 90 Î¼l) and gently mix. <br/></li><li>Add the entire volume to the center of the column.<br/></li><li>Allow the sample to enter the column and after the last drip, add 550 Î¼l PBS to wash. <br/></li><li>Add 300 Î¼l PBS and collect the eluate into 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes by drop counting (3-4 drops per tube).</li></ol><br/>A3. Degree of labeling<br/>Determine protein concentration and degree of labeling of all constructs. We use a TECAN M200 Infinite Pro instrument for this. The degree of labeling is determined as follows: <br/><br/>First, calculate the protein concentration considering the contribution from the fluorophore: <br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="48" img="" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190915/20190915055728_4490.png" width="260"/><br/><br/>Then calculate the moles of dye per mole protein:<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="46" img="" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190915/20190915055902_6162.png" width='420"'/><br/><br/><em>A</em><em><sub>280</sub></em> and <em>A</em><em><sub>dye</sub></em> represent the sample absorbance at 280 nm and absorbance at the dye excitation wavelength, respectively, <em>e</em><em><sub>280</sub></em> and <em>e</em><em><sub>dye</sub></em> are the extinction coefficients of the protein at 280 nm and of the dye at the appropriate wavelength, respectively. <em>CF</em><em><sub>280</sub></em> is the correction factor indicating how much the dye contributes to the Absorbance at 280 nm. For Alexa Flour 488 labeled antibodies use <em>e</em><em><sub>280</sub></em> = 203,000 and <em>CF</em><em><sub>280</sub></em> = 0.11. For SNAP-surface 549 (DY-549) use <em>e</em><em><sub>dye</sub></em> = 150,000 and <em>CF</em><em><sub>280</sub></em> = 0.08. For SNAP-surface 647 (Alexa Fluor 647) use <em>e</em><sub><em>dye</em></sub> = 239,000 and <em>CF</em><em><sub>280</sub></em> = 0.03. If other dyes are found more suitable for your system, use extinction coefficients and correction factors provided by the dye vendor. In our experiments, we aim for labeling efficiencies 5 moles of dye per mole protein for the antibody and above 0.7 moles of dye per mole protein for the protein.<br/><br/></li><li>Cell cultures<br/>HEK293 Grip Tite 293 cells should be maintained at 37 Â°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in sterile T25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks. Cells should be regularly split 1/10 Monday and Friday and never reach more than 90% confluency. If you are using different-sized flasks, scale the reagent volumes up or down accordingly. Cell cultures should be routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by using Cell Culture Contamination Detection Kit (Invitrogen), or similar.<br/><ol class="npwtwo" start="1"><li>Remove media from the flask. Rinse the cells with 5 ml of Dulbeccoâs Phosphate-Buffered Saline (D-PBS) without Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. </li><li>Add 1.5 ml of pre-warmed, 0.25% trypsin-1 mM EDTA solution to the flask.</li><li>Incubate at 37 Â°C until cells have detached (about 2 min). Check the cells under a microscope and confirm that most of the cells have detached. If cells are still attached, incubate a little longer until most of the cells have detached. </li><li>Add 8.5 ml pre-warmed D-MEM medium (see materials) containing 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. Carefully pipette cells suspension up and down to break cell clumps. </li><li>For cell passage add 1.5 ml cell suspension to 13.5 ml fresh pre-warmed D-MEM medium containing 10% FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin to a new T25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask. Add 600 Âµg/ml Geneticin and place in an incubator. </li><li>For transfections mix 10 Î¼l cell suspension with 10 Î¼l Trypan Blue and add 10 Î¼l to the cell counting chamber and count cells. Add 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells in a total volume of 15 ml fresh pre-warmed D-MEM medium containing 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin to a new T25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask. Add 600 Âµg/ml Geneticin and incubate overnight. </li><li>The following day prepare transfections by adding 10 Î¼l Lipofectamine to 1.5 ml Opti-MEM medium in a 15 ml Falcon tube and shake for 2 s. In another tube add 3 Î¼g of vector DNA containing the FLAG-tagged construct to 1.5 ml Opti-MEM and flip a couple of times. Let both stand for 30 min. After 5 min, mix and incubate for additional 30 min. </li><li>Remove media from T25 flasks containing cells for transfection. Wash with D-PBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> and add 1 ml Opti-MEM. </li><li>Add transfections mixtures to the T25 flasks and incubate overnight. The flask should contain 4 ml total (1 ml from Step 8 and 3 ml from Step 7).</li><li>Next day repeat Steps 1-4 but this time dilute transfected cells to 4 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml. </li><li>Add 1 ml prewarmed D-MEM medium to each well in a six-well plate and add 4 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells to each well (2 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 2 ml per well) incubate overnight for cells to attach. Cells should be flattened out and between 40% and 60% confluent.</li><li>For labeling of FLAG-tagged plasma membrane expressed target, remove 1 ml of medium from each cell well leaving 1 ml. Add 1 Î¼g/ml of Alexa Fluor 488 labeled ANTI FLAG M1 antibody (see A2) to each well and keep on ice for an hour. <br/><br/></li></ol></li><li>Supported membrane sheets<br/>C1. Preparations for making inverted membrane sheets<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Initiate preparation of cover glass by cleansing for 20 min at max. power in a Harric plasma cleaner (or similar) and then coat in 1-2 ml 0.3 mM poly-L-ornithine hydrobromide for 30 min followed by washing twice in water: Eight glasses are cleaned at a time by placing these on object glasses. Immediately after cleaning the glasses are transferred to six well plate wells and covered with 0.3 mM poly-L-ornithine hydrobromide. After 30 min, the poly-L-ornithine hydrobromide solution is removed and cover glasses are washed once in approximately 2 ml water in the well and finally 1 ml water is added to keep glasses covered.</li><li>Typically, 24 glasses are prepared. Make a few more than neededâsome will break.</li><li>Prepare âSheet bufferâ (see Recipes) by adding 50 mg of fresh BSA to 50 ml buffer in a 50 ml Falcon tube and keep it on ice. Also, put 2 x 50 ml of MilliQ water on ice.</li><li>Prepare tissue paper box by wetting Whatman paper and cover it with parafilm. Make grids and write labels with a permanent marker. Do not use a red marker as this will dissolve during PFA fixation below (Figure 2).<br/></li><li>Put cells M1 labeled cells on ice and start ultracentrifugation of protein preps (see B12).</li></ol><em>Note: You now have (see Figure 2A):</em><br/><ol class="npwthree"><li><em>Fluorescently labeled protein.</em> </li><li><em>Cold M1 labeled cells (with labeled M1 still on).</em> </li><li><em>Cleaned and poly-L-ornithine hydrobromide treated cover glasses in water approx. 24 pieces depending on desired curves and sample points.</em> </li><li><em>BioAssay dish with moistened Whatman paper and marked up parafilm (Figure 2A).</em><br/></li><li><em>50 ml cold sheet buffer with 1 mg/ml BSA. </em><br/></li><li><em>2x 50 ml cold water.</em><br/></li><li><em>In addition, you need tweezers, flat syringe pistil and bend needle (Figure 2A). Also, you need a P1000 pipette, a clock and suction. </em><br/></li><li><em>At this point also put ~700 Î¼l per sheet 4% PFA and 100 ml PBS on ice for later use.</em><br/><br/></li></ol>C2. Production of Inverted membrane sheets<br/>To prepare sheets, do as follows for each well with cells:<ol class="npwtwo" start="1"><li>Aspirate medium containing M1 antibody (Figure 2B). </li><li>Add approximately 2 ml of cold water to wash cells and start clock (Figure 2B). </li><li>Replace water with clean water to allow osmotic swell. </li><li>After 60 s, remove water, pick up cover glass and put on top of the cells with poly-L-ornithine hydrobromide treated surface facing the cells (Figures 2D-2E). Now press hard on the cover glass with the pistil (Figure 2F). Apply constant pressure while moving around the pistil on the glass for 1 min. It might take a few tries to get the pressure right without breaking the cover glass. To get the pressure right, make an initial series in which the applied pressure is gradually increased and assess the number of sheets using the confocal microscope (see below).<br/>  The pressure required is more than you think. An alternative way to produce the inverted membrane sheets is to firmly press down the cover glass on the cells for 10 s and then remove the water completely. Make sure the cover glass is fully attached to the cells in the bottom of the well. Then wait for 120 sâthe air pressure/surface tension between the cover glass and the well surface will also be sufficient to produce inverted membrane sheets.</li><li>Next, again use the bended needle and tweezers to pick up the cover glass and transfer it to the BioAssay dish with the surface containing the sheets facing upwards. Be patient, it might take a few tries to learn how to pick up the cover glass with the needle. If sufficient pressure has been applied the cover glass will be sticking quite well to the cell surface. </li><li>Immediately after transfer, cover the sheets with approximately 700 Î¼l sheet buffer with BSA to prevent drying and to coat surface with BSA (Figure 2G).</li><li>Repeat process for all sheet preps. </li><li>Leave last prepared sheets in the cold and dark for 20 min to allow BSA to coat the sheets. </li><li>Meanwhile, prepare protein dilutions as calculated above by diluting protein in sheet buffer. Initial dilution in protein buffer is done for the lower conc. Prepare 1 ml per condition. </li><li>Aspirate sheet buffer from sheets and replace it with protein containing sheet buffer. Preferably approx. 700-1,000 Î¼l, no less than 500 Î¼l. Put on plastic cell dishes as lids in addition to box lids and incubate for typically 2 h or more for concentration series and leave at desired temperature in the dark. </li><li>After incubation, remove buffer and wash sheets on the parafilm surface with 1x 700 Î¼l sheet buffer with BSA and two times with cold PBS (no incubation in wash buffer, just start removal in the same order after the last sheet has been covered). Use soft rubber pipettes. </li><li>Next, fix sheets for 40 min in 700 Î¼l 4% cold PFA and in the dark. At this point take out antifade mounting media to allow this to reach room temp. </li><li>After fixation, wash sheets three times in PBS and leave in the last wash. For a few coverslips at the time, remove PBS and wash glasses in a beaker containing ~400 ml water. Remove drops from edge using paper towels and mount glasses on the object glass on a drop of antifade (Figure 2H). Excess antifade can be sucked away. Preps. are kept in the dark at room temperature. After drying they should be stored at 4 Â°C.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190915/20190915060101_6228.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

We do not recommend changing PMT gain settings between independent nâs, however, if necessary, this can be corrected by multiplying by G(V) (will be 1 if gain settings are similar). G(V) is calculated as follows: <br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="49" img="" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190915/20190915060302_8695.png" width="120"/><br/><br/>where <em>Î±</em> is Conductance of dynodes of PMT and <em>n</em> the number of dynodes inside the PMT. <em>Î±</em> and <em>n</em> are specific for the PMTs on your microscopes. <br/></li><li>Finally, the fractional binding can calculate using:<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="46" img="" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190915/20190915060348_0770.png" width="120"/><br/><br/>All binding curves for direct comparison should be performed in parallel, and in presence of positive and negative (non-binding) controls. <br/></li><li>An example of a concentration series and quantified binding can be found in Figures 3B-3C.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="276" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190915/20190915060415_4197.png" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 3. Identifying the SCMS and quantification.</strong> A. Single bilayers are distinguished from undisrupted cells or organelles by their lack of three-dimensional structure. These structures are clearly visible in the direct transmission. B and C. The intensities from both sheets and background for each channel is measured using ImageJ (as described in the main text) and concentration series can be made as presented in B, and quantified as shown in C. Error bars, means Â± SE (n=6). For fitting these data on linear scale we use a one-site total binding model: Y = B<sub>max</sub>*X/(K<sub>d</sub> + X) + NS*X, where NS is the slope of non-specific binding. On a logarithmic scale we used a sigmoidal dose-response with variable slope: Y = Bottom + [(Top-Bottom)/(1+10<sup>(Kd-X)*S</sup>)], where S is the slope steepness. Please note that forced proximity/hindered diffusion will affect the slope steepness and therefore this is not necessarily a good measure of binding cooperativity. Figures are adapted from Erlendsson <em>et al.</em> (2019). Scale bars: 10 Î¼m. <br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29321">### Notes</p><p class="ppzz" style="padding-left:20px;">The method is not restricted to any particular cell type and in principle any adherent cell type can be used. If sufficient signal-to-noise ratio can be obtained, we can also recommend using stable transfected cell lines (or even native cell lines, with a good monoclonal antibody). This will provide an even more realistic view on the effective concentrations of receptors, their clustering and potential avidity effects.<br/><br/>The SCMS are native cell plasma membranes and they contain most, if not all, of the native cellular receptors, transporters, ion channels <em>etc</em>. as well as the cytoskeleton and smaller membrane associated organelles such as vesicles. For this reason, protein ligands can have specific binding to many of these components, as well as non-specific binding to the membrane (this is referred to as the background). In transiently transfected cell cultures, overexpression of the receptor of interest will neglect the native âbackgroundâ binding. In Erlendsson <em>et al.</em> (2019) the non-specific binding, tested by introducing a single but completely disruptive point mutation in the ligand-binding domain, is not detectable. Specific binding tested using a single but completely disruptive point mutation in the receptor binding epitope is 15-20% of binding observed with the wild-type receptor. Please note that background binding is highly system dependent and should be tested in parallel with any binding experiments.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29322">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok" start="1"><li>TBS Buffer<br/>150 mM NaCl <br/>50 mM Trizma <br/>Adjust the pH to 7.35</li><li>DMEM media<br/>D-MEM (high glucose: 4500 mg/L, L-glutamine: 584 mg/L) <br/>10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)<br/>0.1 mM MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA)</li><li>Sheet Buffer<br/>120 mM KCl<br/>2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub><br/>10 mM HEPES <br/>30 mM glucose<br/>Adjust pH to 7.35<br/>Add 50 mg of BSA to 50 ml buffer<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29323">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz" style="padding-left:20px;">This protocol was developed for investigating the binding affinity of scaffolding proteins to membrane embedded receptors presented in Erlendsson <em>et al.</em> (2019).
