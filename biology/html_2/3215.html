            <h1>Measuring Protein Synthesis during Cell Cycle by Azidohomoalanine (AHA) Labeling and Flow Cytometric Analysis</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Koshi   Imami, Tomoharu  Yasuda</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Protein synthesis is one of the most fundamental biological processes to maintain cellular proteostasis. Azidohomoalaine (AHA) is a non-radioactive and âclickableâ amino acid analog of methionine which can be incorporated into newly synthesized proteins. Thus, AHA-labeled nascent proteins can be detected and quantified through fluorescent labeling by "click" chemistry. Here we describe a protocol to measure protein synthesis by AHA labeling and flow cytometry. Taking advantage of gating different cell populations, we provide a typical example of the flow cytometric-based analysis of protein synthesis during the cell cycle. While we used mouse B cells in this protocol this method can be readily applied to any cell types and organisms.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Traditionally measurement of protein synthesis is performed by pulse labeling of translation products using radiolabeled amino acids such as [<sup>35</sup>S]methionine and [<sup>35</sup>S]cysteine but the use of radioactive materials is the major disadvantage. Recent advance in bio-orthogonal chemical reporters such as azides and alkynes allows us to quantitatively monitor and track biomolecules (proteins, lipids or nucleic acids) through click chemistry (Dieterich, 2010). Azidohomoalaine (AHA) (Figure 1) is a methionine analog that contains an azide moiety and is incorporated into newly synthesized proteins. Thus, nascent proteins can be detected through "click" reaction between AHA (azido) and a fluorescent alkyne (Dieterich, 2010).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190414/20190414235054_3073.jpg" width="362"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Chemical structures of L-methionine and L-azidohomoalaine (AHA)</strong><br/><br/>Measuring protein synthesis during the cell cycle in mammalian cells has been challenging. To do this, cell synchronization in specific phases of the cell cycle is necessary but the use of drugs such as nocodazole was shown to affect translation (Coldwell <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Shuda <em>et al.</em>, 2015). To measure protein synthesis without drug treatment, here we used metabolic pulse labeling with AHA in a flow cytometric assay (Kiick <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Shuda <em>et al.</em>, 2015). In combination with AHA, we used anti-phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) antibody as a mitotic marker to monitor mitotic translation in mouse B lymphoma cells (19DN) (Sander <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/></p>
