            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Expansion of fibrous connective tissue and abnormal deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) are at the basis of many fibrotic diseases. Fibrosis can occur in response to both physiological and pathological cues, including wound healing, tissue remodeling/repair and inflammation. Chronic fibrosis can lead to severe tissue damage, organ failure and death. Assessing the extent of organ fibrosis is crucial for accurate diagnosis of this condition. The use of Massonâs trichrome staining of tissue sections from skeletal muscle is a fast method for detection of morphological alterations indicative of a fibrotic phenotype in this organ. This staining method detects the extent of collagen fibers deposition and, because it employs the combination of three dyes, can also distinguish muscle fibers (red), from collagen (blue) and nuclei (black), simultaneously.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Fibrosis is the formation of excessive fibrous connective tissue in an organ as a result of chronic inflammation, tissue damage/remodeling (for instance, following chemical or radiation therapy), persistent infections, autoimmune disease, allergic responses and cancer. During this process excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagens, are deposited and accumulate. If progressive, fibrosis becomes chronic, ultimately leading to organ failure and even death (Rockey <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Several types of fibrotic diseases have been described in humans, many of which are of unknown etiology. The organs most commonly affected are the lungs, kidneys, liver, heart and skeletal muscle (Hinderer <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Majo <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Mahdy, 2019). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for instance, is a common, progressive and often fatal disease associated with scarring of the lung tissue that gradually looses the capacity to oxygenate, leading to the patientâs inability to breathe properly (Lederer <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>A fibrotic process entails the activation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, cells that acquire a stellate or spindle-shape morphology, are motile and contractile, express Î±-smooth muscle actin, and secrete/remodel the ECM, altering the stiffness, morphology and composition of the tissue (Gattazzo <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Kendall <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Rockey <em>et al.</em>, 2015). In the skeletal muscle under healthy conditions fibrosis occurs in the form of scar tissue during the healing process following muscle injury. This is usually associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells that induce satellite cells to proliferate and differentiate into new myotubes and myofibers while simultaneously the ECM undergoes remodeling. In disease conditions, such as muscular dystrophies or myopathies, progressive expansion of the connective tissue and abnormal deposition of ECM components, consequent to myofiber degeneration, ultimately results in full-blown fibrosis (Mahdy, 2019). We have recently discovered that deficiency of the sialic acid processing enzyme neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) in the mouse model of the rare pediatric lysosomal storage disease sialidosis, triggers a persistent expansion of the connective tissue, leading to generalized fibrosis in several organs including the liver, kidney, heart and skeletal muscle (Zanoteli <em>et al.</em>, 2010; van de Vlekkert <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Detection of the fibrotic disease was carried out using Massonâs trichrome staining of tissue sections from skeletal muscle, lung, heart, kidney and liver (Figure 1). This method is generally more accurate and informative than the standard hematoxilin &amp; eosin staining because Massonâs trichrome staining not only maintains intact the overall morphology of the tissues, but also has the advantage of utilizing three dyes that allow for the identification of multiple tissue structures. In skeletal muscle the three dyes, Weigertâs iron hematoxylin, Biebrich scarlet and aniline blue, applied sequentially, allow to distinguish nuclei, muscle fibers and erythrocytes, and collagen fibers, respectively (Figure 1). This method is suitable for the assessment of the extent and distribution of fibrosis in a quantifiable manner, and can be successfully applied for the detection/diagnosis of fibrotic diseases.<br/><br/><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200514/20200514013719_6760.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

For example, the fibrotic areas in the GA muscle, stained with Massonâs Trichrome, may be expressed as percentage of connective tissue area (blue staining) divided by the total area scanned. Comparison between a WT and affected mouse muscle at different ages will allow to assess the progressive increase of connective tissue/collagen area. This progression is directly correlated with the incrased invasion of the muscle fibers by expanding connective tissue, which leads to the disruption of muscle fiber architecture and ensuing loss of function, characterizing fibrosis (Zanoteli <em>et al.</em>, 2010; van de Vlekkert <em>et al.</em>, 2019). A similar analyses can be applied to all tissues stained with Massonâs Trichrome.</li><li>For more information on the Aperion Scanscope and software please visit the website and userâs guide: <a href="https://aperiosoftware.com/" target="_blank">https://aperiosoftware.com/</a><br/><a href="https://tmalab.jhmi.edu/aperiou/userguides/Image_Analysis_UG.pdf" target="_blank">https://tmalab.jhmi.edu/aperiou/userguides/Image_Analysis_UG.pdf</a><br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti36266">### Notes</p><p class="ppzz">The procedure for the Massonâs trichrome staining was optimized for use in our lab; some procedural steps and reagent composition were adapted from published protocols (Ruegg and Meinen, 2015; Carson <em>et al.</em>, 1990).</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti36267">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Weigertâs iron hematoxylin<br/>Mix one part of solution A with one part of solution B.
