            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cell-based functional assays are an important part of compound screening and drug lead optimization, and they can also play a crucial role in the determination of the residues involved in ligand binding and signaling for a particular G-protein-coupled receptor. Conventional methods used for GÎ±<sub>q/15</sub>-coupled receptors rely on the use of fluorescent probes for Ca<sup>++</sup> sensing (such as Fura-2 and Fluo-4) or on the incorporation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-inositol into inositol 1,4,5- triphosphate (IP3). However, these methods are not suitable for screening large libraries of compounds or for screening several mutants of the same receptor. In contrast, the IP-One assay by Cisbio is a TR-FRET assay suitable for large compound library screening when using stable cell lines that express a specific 7TMR. However, when using transiently transfected mutants of a 7TMR, this assay is not ideal, as it requires a two-step protocol of cell culture. Therefore, we have optimized the IP-One assay protocol using the reverse transfection method in 384-well plates. This offers a time- and resource-efficient alternative to the two-step protocol previously used for the screening of several mutants of GÎ±<sub>q/15</sub>-coupled 7TMRs.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMR), also known as G-protein-coupled receptors, are the most important transmembrane protein superfamily involved in signal transduction. They are the target of 30 to 50% of clinically approved drugs (Overington <em>et al.</em>, 2006). GÎ±<sub>q/15</sub>-coupled 7TMRs activate phospholipase C Î² (PLCÎ²) and produce D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 trigger a release of intracellular Ca<sup>++</sup> storages and is later degraded into IP2, IP1 and ultimately D-myo-inositol (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816224957_7844.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. The GÎ±<sub>q</sub> signaling pathway.</strong> Upon agonist binding at a given GÎ±<sub>q</sub>-coupled 7TMR, the Î± subunit dissociates from the Î²Î³ dimer and activates the PLCÎ², thus initiating the cleavage of PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. IP3 is then degraded into IP2, IP1, and myo-inositol. Accumulation of IP1 is achieved by using a stimulation buffer containing LiCl to inhibit IP1 degradation into myo-inositol and further recycling.<br/><br/>GÎ±<sub>q/15</sub> activation is commonly measured by dectecting Ca<sup>++</sup> flux using fluorescent calcium dye indicators. However, these indicators require either the use of an Atto-Fluor microscope with very low throughput, or investment in an expensive fluorescent imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Arkin <em>et al.</em>, 2004). Another GÎ±<sub>q/15</sub> activity quantification method relies on the detection of [<sup>3</sup>H]-inositol-phosphates ([<sup>3</sup>H]-IPs) following incubation of cells with [<sup>3</sup>H]-inositol. This highly reliable assay is based on the accumulation of [<sup>3</sup>H]-IPs after stimulation with a 7TMR agonist (Thomsen and Behan, 2007). However, both the FLIPR calcium flux assay and the [<sup>3</sup>H]-IPs detection method have important drawbacks. On the one hand, the Ca<sup>++</sup> flux is transient and rapid, the assay does not permit the detection of constitutive activity (and thus, inverse agonism), and the readout can be interfered with by fluorescent compounds (Garbison <em>et al.</em>, 2004). On the other hand, [<sup>3</sup>H]-IPs detection assays are time-consuming, very expensive, and generate radioactive waste that needs to be disposed of properly. A non-radioactive assay based on the detection of accumulated IP1 using a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence assay has been developed by Cisbio (Trinquet <em>et al.</em>, 2011). This assay is based on a competition between endogenous IP1 and d2-labeled IP1 binding to an Eu cryptate-conjugated IP1 antibody (<strong>Figure 2</strong>, Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2008).<br/><br/>Several protocols have been developed for the quantification of IP1 using Cisbioâs IP-One assay, but they only apply for the screening of different compounds at a single receptor. Traditional protocols for IP-One assay using transient or stable receptor expression are designed in a 2-step protocol. First, cells are plated into petri-dishes and transfected for 24 to 48 h to achieve a suitable cell-surface receptor expression (if transient expression is preferred). Next, cells are detached using trypsin and re-suspended in stimulation buffer before being distributed and stimulated into the assay 384-well plate (Shehata <em>et al.</em>, 2016; St-Pierre <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Other variations of this protocol using stable cell lines are reported and involve a plating step into the assay plate 24 h before stimulation (Cassutt <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2010).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200816/20200816225017_7751.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 2. IP-One assay principle.</strong> Endogenous IP1 produced after 7TMR activation enter into competition with the exogenous d2-labeled IP1 for binding to the exogenous Eu-cryptate anti-IP1 antibody. When d2-IP1 is bound to the Eu-cryptate anti-IP1 antibody, the close proximity of the two fluorescent dyes allows for energy transfer during the readout (represented by the orange arrow). The more IP1 is produced by 7TMR activation, the less d2-IP1 is bound to the Eu-cryptate anti-IP1 antibody and the less energy transfer can be recorded during readout.<br/><br/>In order to avoid the transfection of receptors and mutants into petri dishes and then the transfer of cells into the assay plates, and to avoid unnecessary exposition to trypsin that can lead to non-functional surface receptors, we have developed a single step transfection and assay protocol. This protocol uses reverse transfection of the receptorâs DNA and direct plating of cells in a cell culture-treated and assay-suitable 384-well plate. After 48-h incubation, adherent cells are then washed and used in the IP-One assay (Gusach <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Luginina <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This protocol can also be used for receptors that are not coupled to GÎ±<sub>q</sub> by co-transfection of the GÎ±<sub>15/16</sub> G protein-coding plasmid along with the receptorâs plasmid as GÎ±<sub>15/16</sub> are promiscuous G proteins able to couple to non-GÎ±<sub>q</sub>-coupled 7TMRs (New and Wong, 2004; Robas and Fidock, 2005).<br/></p>

In case of multimode reader fail or malfunction after the first read, the plate can be read again without loss in HTRF intensity. In the rare event of HTRF reader break or inoperability, the plate can be sealed with a plastic seal and frozen at -20 Â°C for up to 2 months (a slight loss of signal can occur after thawing).</li><li>Setup used for HTRF readout with Tecan GENios Pro multi-mode plate reader:<ol class="npwthree"><li>First measurement:<br/>Excitation: 320 Â± 25 nm<br/>Emission: 620 Â± 10 nm</li><li>Second measurement:<br/>Excitation: 320 Â± 25 nm<br/>Emission: 665 Â± 10 nm <br/>Gain: Optimal<br/>Read mode: Top<br/>Filter switch mode: per Plate<br/>Mirror selection: Dichroic 3 (<em>e.g.</em>, FI)<br/>Integration:<br/>Lag time: 150 Âµs<br/>Integration time: 500 Âµs<br/>Read:<br/>Number of reads: 10<br/>Time between move and read: 0 ms</li></ol><br/>A list of HTRF compatible plate reader and readout setup instructions is available at <a href="http://www.cisbio.com/compatible-readers" target="_blank">http://www.cisbio.com/compatible-readers</a>.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti35190">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Poly-L-Lysine 0.1 mg/ml solution<ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 5 mg of Poly-L-Lysine Hydrobromide into 50 ml of ddH<sub>2</sub>O and vortex</li><li>Filter sterilize the solution into a 50-ml conical tube using a sterile 60-ml syringe and a sterile 0.22 Âµm filter under a biosafety cabinet</li></ol></li><li>Complete DMEM (media for HEK293 cells)<br/>DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin-streptomycin, and 20 mM HEPES<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti35191">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">This work has been funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR, grant FDN-148413).
