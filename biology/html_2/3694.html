            <h1>Mechanical Tissue Compression and Whole-mount Imaging at Single Cell Resolution for Developing Murine Epididymal Tubules</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Tsuyoshi Hirashima</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Cells inside the body are subjected to various mechanical stress, such as stretch or compression provided by surrounding cells, shear stresses by blood or lymph flows, and normal stresses by luminal liquids. Force loading to the biological tissues is a fundamental method to better understand cellular responses to such mechanical stimuli. There have been many studies on compression or stretch experiments that target culture cells attached to a flexible extensible material including polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS); however, the know-how of those targeting to tissues is still incomplete. Here we present the protocol for mechanical tissue compression and image-based analysis by focusing on developing murine epididymis as an example. We show a series of steps including tissue dissection from murine embryos, hydrogel-based compression method using a manual device, and non-destructive volumetric tissue imaging. This protocol is useful for quantifying and exploring the biological mechanoresponse system at tissue level.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Cells can respond to mechanical stimuli through intracellular biochemical signaling pathways. This cellular mechanoresponse is known to play a fundamental role in various biological processes such as embryonic development, regeneration, tissue homeostasis, and cancer metastasis (Mammoto <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Humphrey <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Vining and Mooney, 2017). Recent experiments regarding force loading externally to the cells have revealed how cells react to the given mechanical stimuli. For example, it has been shown that stretching or compressing a cell monolayer attaching to a flexible silicone substrate like polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) triggers a mechanosensitive ion channel protein Piezo1 to evoke various cellular behaviors such as cell division and extrusion, leading to homeostatic cell number in the tissues (Eisenhoffer <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Gudipaty <em>et al.</em>, 2017). There are various force manipulations to adherent culture cells; however, the manipulation methods to volumetric tissues are far from sufficient (CampÃ s, 2016). Force manipulation can be performed using magnetic oil droplets but specialized devices are required (Serwane <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Here we show an easier way to compress a tubular tissue and examine the cellular response by specifically focusing on the murine epididymis.</p>

Lateral compression makes the tube thin isotropically while longitudinal compression makes it slightly thick in the buckled point. Scale bar = 10 Âµm. C.
