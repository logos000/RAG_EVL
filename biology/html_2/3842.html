            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>During immune responses, B cells home to lymph nodes (LN), where they encounter antigens. Homing starts with capture and L-selectin-dependent rolling on the activated endothelium of high endothelial venules (HEV). After recognition of chemokines presented on HEV, activation of B cell integrins occurs mediating firm arrest. Subsequently, B cells crawl to the spot of extravasation to enter the LN. Extravasation can be visualized and quantified <em>in vivo</em> by intravital microscopy (IVM) of the inguinal LN. Here, we describe an established protocol that permits detailed <em>in vivo</em> analysis of B cell recruitment to LN under sterile inflammatory conditions. We describe data acquisition, exportation, quantification, and statistical analysis using specialized software. IVM of LN is a powerful technique that can provide a better understanding of B cell migratory behavior during inflammation <em>in vivo</em>.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>The secondary LN play a fundamental role in immune responses at different locations in the body as they are tactically localized to drain antigens via the lymphatic system. This implies <em>in situ</em>, the recruitment of immune cells, antigen encountering, and the mounting of immune responses (Tan and Watanabe, 2010; Tavares <em>et al.</em>, 2014). B cell recirculation through the LN begins with its capture and L-selectin-dependent rolling, along the high endothelial venules (HEV); subsequently, B cells firmly arrest through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR)-mediated recognition of optimal concentrations of chemokines presented on the luminal surface of the HEV. B cell arrest critically depends on the acquisition of the high-affinity conformation of the integrins LFA-1, VLA-4 (Park <em>et al.</em>, 2016). After arrest, B cells crawl to search for a proper site for extravasation into the parenchyma of the LN, where they can recognize antigens and mount an immune response (Pereira <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Mesin <em>et al.</em>, 2016). The release of B cells from the LN also requires chemokine gradient sensing and interaction with the endothelium of the lymphatic sinuses; however, their exit through the efferent lymph is still poorly understood (Park <em>et al.</em>, 2016).</p><br/><p>The migration of B cells relies on actin cytoskeletal remodeling and is tightly controlled by signaling molecules such as kinases, GTPases, and motor proteins. Morphological changes resulting from this process are indispensable for rolling, adhesion, migration, motility, filipodia formation, and transmigration (De Pascalis and Etienne-Manneville, 2017). To study these events <em>in vivo</em>, IVM of the LN is a powerful technique that allows in real-time, the visualization of the earliest steps of B-cell extravasation, as well as their behavior and morphological changes during migration (Miller <em>et al.</em>, 2003). Although, variations of this technique have been used before to visualize lymphocyte trafficking to Peyer patches or spleen, the inguinal LN has the advantage of being easily accessible for IVM without much surgical effort. Less surgical manipulation allows for better preservation of vascular integrity and blood flow, and better visibility during video recording for the quantification of migratory parameters (von Andrian, 1996; Lafouresse <em>et al.</em>, 2015).</p><br/><p>In previous work, we focused on the evaluation of the long-tailed class-I myosin, Myo1e, as a regulator of migration <em>of</em> activated B cells in the inguinal LN. We found that the absence of Myo1e causes defective B cell recruitment to the LN (Giron-Perez <em>et al.</em>, 2020). In particular, the number of rolling B cells and their rolling velocity were increased in the different HEVs of types I and II, whereas slow-rolling and adhesion were reduced in the HEVs of types III and IV. Moreover, the absence of Myo1e diminished B cell spreading and transmigration (Giron-Perez <em>et al.</em>, 2020).</p><br/><p>Here we describe a protocol to analyze B cell migration into the inguinal LN by IVM. We provide a detailed description from the purification of B cells to data analysis. This protocol may be adapted to explore the migration of other cell types and the effect of different treatments in this context. Our method can be easily established and multiple adaptations are feasible including application of blocking antibodies or pharmaceuticals to interfere with B cell migration <em>in vivo</em>.</p><br/></p>

Also, secure the head with a 5 cm thread positioned behind the teeth and fix it with tape. Both ends of the thread should be fixed in front of the nose of the mouse (Jacobs and Hopper-Borge, 2014).</p><p><em>Optional: The carotid artery can be more accessible if a 1 ml pipette tip is positioned under the neck of the mouse before the catheterization.</em> </p></li><li><p>Place the mouse under the dissection microscope. Make sure all the material needed is accessible.</p></li><li><p>Below the chin, make a small incision, introduce the scissors in a closed position between the skin and submaxillary glands and separate them by carefully opening the scissors; Make a 2 cm longitudinal cut through the skin of the neck.</p></li><li><p>Once the submaxillary glands are exposed, separate them by cutting the connective tissue between them. Separate them gently by employing 2 curved forceps. After these, use the left forceps to separate the muscle from the trachea while inserting the right forceps next to the trachea and carefully dissecting the fascia that surrounds the carotid artery. Also, dissect the vagus nerve located next to the artery (This serves to completely isolate the artery which avoids mistakes when inserting the catheter).</p></li><li><p>Cut approximately 8 cm of the polyester thread and bend it in a hairpin-like shape and with the forceps, draw it below the carotid artery and leave equal portions of the thread aside of the artery. Cut the thread so that two equal portions are located beneath the carotid artery. One portion should be towards the thorax while the other thread should be located towards the head (Figure 3A).</p></li><li><p>Close the blood flux to the brain by firmly tying a knot as close as possible to the head (Figure 3B, red arrow). Leave the two extremes of the thread free; after catheterization, they are used for securing the catheter with a double knot.</p></li><li><p>Make a loose knot in the farthest portion of the artery, in direction to the thorax (Figure 3B, black arrow). (This knot will remain loose and will serve for securing and fixing the catheter once it is inserted inside the artery).</p></li><li><p>With the left forceps, slightly lift the carotid artery by pulling out the loose knot in a way that it does not loses its shape. With the right hand, use a clip applicator to place a straight clamp to the artery. This clamp should be placed after the loose knot (in direction to the thorax) (Figure 3C). Make sure enough space (approximately 1 cm length) is left to insert the catheter to the carotid artery.</p></li><li><p>Once the clamp is securely placed, use the spring scissors to make a small incision close to the portion of the artery located towards the head of the mouse (Blood will be spilled as a consequence of this cut).</p></li><li><p>Hold the tight knot to fix the artery with the right hand while inserting the catheter into the carotid artery. (Insert the catheter with the tip in an upward direction; this will avoid damaging the artery. Once the catheter is inside, tighten the loose knot to secure in place the catheter; fix the catheter with the threads located towards the head with a double knot (Figure 3D).</p></li><li><p>Slowly release the clamp with a clip applicator. Blood will invade the inner part of the catheter. If it is correctly placed, blood pumping inside the catheter will be seen (Figure 3D) (Obstruction of the catheter can be tested by delivering a small amount of saline solution with a 31 G syringe. This is an optional step).</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3842/bioprotoc-10-23-3842-g003.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.

Change the videos to 8 bits and set the scale according to the distance covered by the objective and the camera of the microscope. For example, in our conditions, when using the 20x objective and our camera, 480 pixels correspond to 712 Î¼m (For this step, a scale can be set simply by acquiring an image of a known scale). This is fundamental for further quantification.</p></li><li><p>Multiple data can be obtained from this technique.
