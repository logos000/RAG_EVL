            <h1>Method for Primary Epithelial Cell Culture from the Rat Choroid Plexus</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Valeria  Lallai, Amina  Ahmed, Christie D. Fowler</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The choroid plexus consists of a network of secretory epithelial cells localized throughout the lateral, third and fourth ventricles of the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is generated by the choroid plexus and released into the ventricular environment. This biofluid contains an enriched source of proteins, ions, and other signaling molecules for extracellular support of neurons and glial cells within the central nervous system. Given that other cells in the brain also release factors into the CSF, <em>in vitro</em> investigations of choroid plexus function are necessary to isolate processes selectively occurring within and released from this tissue. Here, we describe a protocol to isolate choroid plexus tissue from each of the ventricular locations, and the cell culture conditions required to support growth and maintenance of these epithelial cells. This technique allows for investigations of the functional significance of the choroid plexus, such as for the examination of stimuli promoting the release of growth factors and extracellular vesicles (<em>e.g.</em>, exosomes and microvesicles) from ventricle-specific choroid plexus epithelial cells.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The choroid plexus produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and maintains chemical homeostasis in the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system. The choroid plexus is comprised of epithelial cells, connective tissue and blood vessels, and this structure is localized in all ventricular regions, including within the lateral, third and fourth ventricles. At each of these sites, the choroid plexus appears to differ relative to structure, function and factors produced and released into the ventricles (Johanson <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Lun <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Lallai <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This tissue actively produces and secretes various signaling molecules, such as growth hormones, transthyretin and transferrin, into the brain and has been implicated in a wide range of functions related to brain development, aging, nutrient transport, endocrine regulation, and pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. As such, dysfunction in the choroid plexus would potentially alter CSF composition and compromise brain health. As the field progresses, the vital function of factors derived from the choroid plexus will certainly continue to emerge, and these advances may then provide a foundation for novel approaches to treat neuropathology in humans.<br/><br/>Previous <em>in vitro</em> approaches to examine choroid plexus function have derived choroidal epithelial cell culture from rat, porcine, human and immortalized murine cells (Zheng and Zhao, 2002; Monnot and Zheng, 2013; Tenenbaum <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Delery and MacLean, 2019). However, several considerations have been noted that limit the usefulness of prior techniques. First, immortalized cell lines do not appear to retain the properties of choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPEC) since they become very susceptible to changes in morphology and property <em>in vitro</em> (Angelow <em>et al.</em>, 2004). Along these lines, we have found highly variable expression of the choroid plexus specific marker transthyretin across passages in the cell lines Z310 (obtained from Dr. Wei Zheng, Purdue University) and HCPEpiC (commercially available from ScienCell Research Laboratories), suggesting altered protein expression in the immortalized state compared to primary-derived tissues (Lallai and Fowler, unpublished findings). Next, since the location of the epithelial cells used to derive the cell lines may be from one or multiple ventricular locations, and given that different transcript expression and function is found in choroid plexus tissue among the ventricular locations (Lun <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Lallai <em>et al.</em>, 2019), the immortalized cell lines may not be representative of the specific subregion of the tissue of interest. Indeed, the prior approaches have focused on choroid plexus dissection solely derived from the lateral and/or fourth ventricular locations (e.g., as opposed to the smaller third ventricle), have combined choroid plexus from multiple locations into one sample for analysis, or have focused on species with larger yields of choroid plexus tissue (e.g., primate, porcine and human).<br/><br/>To overcome these challenges, we developed a modified protocol to derive primary culture of choroidal epithelial cells from rodents, which allows one to discern between choroid plexus tissue from third, lateral and fourth ventricles (Lallai <em>et al.</em>, 2019). With this approach, we have been able to investigate the release of factors into the cell culture medium, thereby mimicking the physiological release of factors and vesicles into CSF of the brain. Of note, the current protocol also uses exosome-depleted fetal bovine serum (FBS) to allow for examination of extracellular vesicles released from the choroid plexus cells in culture conditions; this condition has been incorporated since non-depleted FBS has been shown to contain a variety of extracellular vesicles containing bovine-derived proteins, RNA and DNA, which may contaminate analyses and conclusions (Wei <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Kornilov <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Moreover, the cultures obtained from this protocol provide cells with distinct structural characteristics of epithelial cells and express the choroid plexus specific protein transthyretin (Lallai <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In the following sections, we describe the methods to discretely dissect choroid plexus tissue from different ventricles and generate primary culture choroidal epithelial cells from rat. Further, recommendations and troubleshooting tips are also provided.</p>

The amount of PDL and laminin varies according to the size of the well. Itâs essential that the liquid film covers the entire surface of the bottom and between 2-4 mm of the side walls. For example, in a 96-well cell culture plate, apply 0.05 to 0.1 ml of solution with a micropipette to fill each well 2-4 mm up the sides of the wells.</li><li>Dilute PDL 1:50 with sterile cell culture grade water and dilute laminin 1:50 with DMEM.

Keep the wells filled with laminin until just prior to plating with cell mixture.<br/><br/></li></ol></li><li>Choroid plexus tissue collection from rat brain<ol class="npwtwo"><li>To facilitate processing, set up the biosafety hood with pipets, TrypLE Express, 1x Collagenase, Type II Working Solution, HBSS, CPEC medium, and tools prior to starting dissections.</li><li>Place rat in isoflurane induction chamber preloaded with 3% isoflurane/oxygen mixture to anesthetize the rat. Maintain the level of isoflurane until the animal is fully anesthetized. This can be evidenced by pinching the foot and tail; there should be no reaction from the rat, which will verify that the animal is under full anesthesia prior to proceeding. Thereafter, quickly decapitate the rat with the rodent guillotine. Hold the head in your hand and cut the skin on the top of the head longitudinally along the top of the skull to the tip of the nose. Separate the skin laterally to expose the skull. Use microbone rongeurs to remove the skull from around the brain, starting at the cerebellum and moving anterior toward the olfactory bulbs. The brain removal and subsequent dissection should occur as quickly as possible to prevent tissue degradation. For best results, complete the dissections within 1 h or less. Moreover, ensure that the brain tissue and samples are submerged in dissecting medium (Recipe 1), including when storing in microtubes on ice following dissection.</li><li>Transfer the brain to the chilled rat brain matrix in a Petri dish (Figure 1A), which has been placed on wet ice for 5 min before proceeding. Rinse brain with chilled dissecting medium. During the subsequent phases the tissue will be continuously wet with chilled dissecting medium to maintain tissue integrity and ensure maximum cell yield.</li><li>The brain can now be cut along the coronal plane with a straight edge blade at two separate locations: (1) at the level of the septum (Anterior-Posterior (AP) ~1.00) and (2) at the level of the raphe (~AP -5.5) [see coordinate references in Paxinos and Watson (1997)] (Figure 1B).</li><li>Transfer the posterior brain portion, containing the 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle, to a new, sterile Petri dish containing a small drop of superglue. Orient the brain chunk onto the superglue with the raphe brain side facing downward, and the cerebellum and brain stem pointing upwards (Figure 1C). Add chilled dissecting medium to the Petri dish to completely cover the brain chunk.</li><li>Transfer the middle brain portion, containing the lateral and 3<sup>rd</sup> ventricles, to another sterile Petri dish and superglue the brain chunk on the ventral surface (<em>e.g.</em>, with the cortex facing upwards) (Figure 1D). Add chilled dissecting medium to the Petri dish to completely cover the brain chunk.</li><li>During the next steps, place the dish under a dissecting microscope to ensure accurate dissection technique (Figure 1E).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="322" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216111541_5918.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Preparation of the brain for dissection.</strong> A. After removing the brain, place into chilled brain matrix. B. Insert two straight edge razor blades into the brain matrix to create three chunks: anterior [containing the olfactory bulbs to the level of the septum (approximately APâ~1.0)], posterior [containing the brainstem, cerebellum and midbrain to the level of the raphe (approximately APâ~5.5)], and (3) central portion. C. Glue the posterior chunk onto the bottom of the Petri dish with the brainstem (black arrow) and cerebellum (white arrow) facing upwards. D. Glue the central chunk onto the bottom of the Petri dish with the cortex facing upwards. E. Pour chilled dissecting medium into the Petri dish to submerge the brain chunks and then place under the dissecting microscope for visualization.<br/><br/></li><li>Delicately separated the cerebellum from the brain stem using forceps to allow for visualization of the fourth ventricle. The choroid plexus will be visualized within this opening as a light red/pink string of floating tissue (Figure 2A). Use the forceps to gently remove the choroid plexus. Verify that brain tissue is not attached by microscopic inspection; the visualization of the choroid plexus (<em>e.g.</em>, light red/pink string-like appearance) will be distinct from brain tissue (<em>e.g.</em>, white/grey tissue) (Figure 2B). If any brain tissue is attached to the choroid plexus, carefully remove the tissue with forceps from the target choroid plexus tissue. It is better to collect less tissue and be sure that the choroid plexus sample is pure, rather than to collect extra tissue areas that may contaminate the cell populations in culture. Place the sample in a 1.7 ml microtube with dissecting medium, close the cap, and store on ice.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="143" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216111558_0826.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 2. Dissection of the fourth ventricle choroid plexus.</strong> A. Use fine tip forceps to gently separate the brainstem from the cerebellum. This will reveal the fourth ventricle cavity and will expose the internal choroid plexus tissue. B. Gently pull the choroid plexus tissue to remove it from the fourth ventricle. It will appear stringy and red/light pink in color (white arrow).<br/><br/></li><li>For the dissections of the lateral and third ventricle choroid plexus, use a straight edge blade to gently cut the corpus callosum along the longitudinal fissure (Figure 3A). However, do not make a complete cut all the way down to the bottom of the Petri dish; make a partial cut through the corpus callosum to reveal the 3<sup>rd</sup> ventricle. If the cut goes too deep, the 3<sup>rd</sup> ventricle choroid plexus tissue will be difficult to visualize and isolate from the brain tissue.<br/></li><li>Gently pull the cortex and the hippocampus laterally to either side with forceps to expose the dorsal third ventricle choroid plexus along the midline (Figure 3B), which will appear as a light red/pink floating tissue folded in the center of this area. Remove the choroid plexus tissue by gently pulling it out (Figure 3C), verify that brain tissue is not attached (Figure 3D), place the sample in a 1.7 ml microtube with dissecting medium, and store on ice. When removing the tissue, ensure that you do not pull choroid plexus from other locations by using a precise dissection technique (Figures 4A-4F). Depending on the location of the coronal cut relative to other brain structures, the lateral ventricle choroid plexus may be confused for the dorsal third ventricle choroid plexus tissue. Choroid plexus from the dorsal third ventricle will be the smallest size of tissue collected, since it is only localized on the midline, just above the habenular region. Thus, if a long string of choroid plexus is pulled when isolating from the ventricular region, this is more likely choroid plexus tissue from the lateral ventricles, which would have been exposed if the midline was cut too deeply in Step B9 (see Figures 6A-6B below). Therefore, if it is critical for your studies to maintain the distinction between ventricular locations, the sample may not be used due to ambiguity of localization.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="233" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216111614_9221.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.

Step-by-step dissection of the third ventricle choroid plexus.</strong> A. After separating the cortical tissue from each side, the third ventricle choroid plexus can be visualized directly on the midline. The white arrow denotes the location at the top of this choroid plexus tissue, which appears light pink in color. B. The forceps can be gently slid underneath the tissue to dissociate the choroid plexus (arrow) from the surrounding area. C. The choroid plexus tissue should now be movable within the third ventricle area. The white arrow identifies the floating tissue. D. Forceps are used to gently pull the choroid plexus from the ventricular cavity. The white arrow identifies the tissue being gently separated at the top of the brain chunk. E. After removal, the choroid plexus (arrow) should not be attached to any connective tissue. F. Side-view shows the removal of the third ventricle choroid plexus (arrow) from the midline.<br/><br/></li><li>Next, to obtain the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle, move the hippocampus on each side to reveal the lateral ventricles (Figure 5A) and gently pull on the choroid plexus to remove it from this position (Figure 5B). The lateral choroid plexus will appear as a longer string of tissue (Figure 5C). Verify that brain tissue is not attached and that you have correctly discriminated between the lateral ventricle and dorsal third ventricle choroid plexus tissues (Figures 6A-6B). Thereafter, place samples in microtubes with dissecting medium and store on ice.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="583" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200216/20200216111651_5112.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.

Every five minutes tap and flick the tubes hard, about 60 times total to break up the tissueâdo NOT vortex. Primary cells are quite sensitive to mechanical stress, and excessive stress will result in increased cell death. You will see the tissue break down and the clear buffer will turn cloudy with small clumps of tissue (Figures 7A-B).</li><li>At this stage rinse sample by adding 1 ml of HBSS. Spin tubes at 300 <em>x g</em> for 2-3 min and then aspirate the supernatant with a P1000 pipet tip as follows: first aspirate 200 Î¼l, then an additional 200 Î¼l, and then the final remaining supernatant. Remove as much supernatant as possible, without touching the cell pellet. This approach prevents too much upward draw from the pipet tip and the sample from being aspirated, which may occur with extraction of larger volumes.</li><li>To further dissociate the samples, tap the pellet and add 500 Î¼l of TrypLE Express. Incubate the tubes at 37 Â°C in a bead bath for 10-20 min, tapping the tubes every 5 min. For good viability of the cells, it is important not to over-digest. Therefore, examine the cells in the microtube with an inverted light microscope to verify that the tissue is breaking down into small clumps (Figures 7C-7D).</li><li>The process is complete as soon as a suspension with single cells and small clumps (containing less than 10 cells) is achieved.</li><li>Next add 500 Î¼l of CPEC medium (Recipe 4).

If the cell yield is low (see Section D), repeat step C6 by adding CPEC medium and triturating.</li><li>After centrifuging, aspirate the supernatant with a P1000 pipet tip and wash the cell pellet with 500 Î¼l of CPEC medium. To prevent over-extraction of the pellet, avoid using the vacuum for fast rinses, but rather use a micropipette, making sure that the end of the tip is on the opposite side of the pellet.
