            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Hunter S. Shaw, Joe Larkin, Yong Rao</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The <em>Drosophila</em> retina contains light-sensitive photoreceptors (R cells) with distinct spectral sensitivities that allow them to distinguish light by its spectral composition. R7 and R8 photoreceptors are important for color vision, and can be further classified into pale (p) or yellow (y) subtypes depending on the rhodopsin expressed. While both R7y and R7p are sensitive to UV light, R8y and R8p detect light in the green and blue spectrum, respectively. The ability of R7 and R8 photoreceptors to distinguish different spectral sensitivities and the natural preference for <em>Drosophila</em> towards light sources (phototaxis), allow for the development of a phototactic T-maze assay that compares the functionality of different R7 and R8 subtypes. A âUV vs. blueâ choice can compare the functionalities of R7p and R8p photoreceptors, while a âUV vs. greenâ choice can compare the functionalities of R7y and R8y photoreceptors. Additionally, a âblue vs. greenâ choice could be used to compare R8p and R8y photoreceptors, while a âdark vs. light" choice could be used to determine overall vision functionality. Although electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging have been used to examine functionality of R7 and R8 photoreceptors, these approaches require expensive equipment and are technically challenging. The phototactic T-maze assay we present here is a robust, straight-forward and an inexpensive method to study genetic and developmental factors that contribute to the individual functionality of R7 and R8 photoreceptors, and is especially useful when performing large-scale genetic screens.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The <em>Drosophila</em> visual system provides an excellent model to understand the mechanisms controlling neuronal circuit development and function. Each adult <em>Drosophila</em> compound eye is made up of roughly 800 single eye units called ommatidia. The ommatidia reside in the most distal portion of the visual system, called the retina. Each ommatidium is composed of 8 light-sensitive photoreceptors (R cells), with the motion-sensitive outer R1-R6 cells forming a stereotypical horseshoe shape around the color-sensitive inner R7 and R8 cells. The R7 cell body lies in the distal retina, directly above the more proximal R8 cell body. The R1-R6 cells are responsible for motion detection and express rhodopsin(Rh)-1 which detects light in a broad spectrum (Montell, 2012; Behnia and Desplan, 2015). R7 and R8 photoreceptors are responsible for color vision and express Rh3 or Rh4 and Rh5 or Rh6, respectively (Rister and Heisenberg, 2006; Morante and Desplan, 2008).<br/><br/>R7 and R8 photoreceptors can be further classified into either short-wavelength pale (p) or long-wavelength yellow (y) subtypes depending on the rhodopsin they express. R7p and R7y express Rh-3 and Rh-4 respectively, and detect light in the UV-spectrum, while R8p and R8y express Rh-5 and Rh-6 respectively, and detect blue and green light, respectively (Morante and Desplan, 2008). This specification of the ommatidia to either a yellow or pale fate is not evenly distributed, with ~70% of the ommatidia containing the yellow (long-wave UV and green) and ~30% containing the pale (short-wave UV and blue) (Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Montell, 2012). All R cells have their cell bodies within the retina, and project the axons into the optic lobe where they form synaptic connections with their respective targets (Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989).<br/><br/>The difference in spectral sensitivity among R7 (UV light) and R8 (blue or green light) subtypes, and that flies demonstrate phototactic behavior (the preference to move towards a light source) (Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010), allow us to test the differential functionality of R7 and R8 photoreceptors by developing a behavioral choice paradigm with âUV vs. blueâ or âUV vs. greenâ light sources. This is an example of âdifferential phototaxisâ, where flies will choose between two light sources. Conversely, âfast phototaxisâ can be observed when flies in a âlight vs. darkâ paradigm rush quickly towards the light source (Benzer, 1967), believing it to be an escape. The development of a rapid phototactic T-maze assay to assess the difference in color preference is very useful for understanding the differential requirements of genes for the development and function of R7 and R8 photoreceptors, which form synaptic contacts with different post-synaptic partners (Rister <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Millard and Pecot, 2018; Shaw <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>Electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging have been able to elegantly demonstrate photoreceptor subtype functionality (Harris <em>et al.</em>, 1976; Dolph <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Weir <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Schnaitmann <em>et al.</em>, 2018). However, these approaches require expensive equipment and are technically challenging. By comparison, the phototactic T-maze paradigm behavioral assay is an affordable, simple, and high throughput method, which can be readily used in large-scale genetic screens for genes controlling color vision. The behavioral T-maze choice assay we describe here is modified from the phototactic choice paradigm described previously by Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em> (2010), whose design in turn was based off of the original odor paradigm generated by Tully and Quinn (1985). In this protocol, we describe in detail the schematics for building the T-maze apparatus and the use of this system for the analysis of color vision. In our recent study (Shaw <em>et al.</em>, 2019), we used this T-maze system to examine the role of the transmembrane protein Borderless (Bdl) in the regulation of color vision. Our apparatus has a horizontal design, as oppose to the traditional vertical design, for increased stability and convenience. Additionally, our data analysis takes into account the animals that do not make a choice (neutral flies that remain at the choice point), which would significantly affect the results in certain experimental paradigms.<br/></p>

This will cause pressure on the lift in the direction of the body, so when the first pin is removed the fly holding chamber moves quickly from Loading to Holding states, and when the second pin is removed it moves from Holding to Open states.<ol class="npwthree"><li>There are two elastic holding screws on top of the body at the lift insertion end.</li><li>A single elastic holding screw is on the lift at the end opposite the insertion point.</li><li>Multiple elastics can be wrapped around (or folded over on themselves) to increase the tension that will allow shifting to occur at the desired speed.</li></ol></li><li>The single adjustment screw on the body near the lift insertion makes direct contact with the pins. It can be adjusted allowing the loading mouth of the body and the holding chamber of the lift to be perfectly aligned when in the Loading state (Figures 1, 2C and 3D).</li><li>On the opposite side of the body, where the choice point is, are the vial holders (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4D).<ol class="npwthree"><li>There are two elastic holding screws on each holder for elastic bands to be wrapped around. These elastics will hold the vial securely in place.</li><li>The holders have a vial lip notch that have been made specifically to the specifications of the vial so that the lip should sit securely in the holder.</li><li>Wrap an elastic band around the vial to insure a secure fit during testing, ensuring that the flies cannot escape.</li></ol></li><li>When the final pin is removed and the tension in the elastic pulls the holding chamber to the choice point, the lift stop is important for quickly stopping the lift (Figures 2A-2B, 3C-3D). When the lift is in contact with the lift stop, the holding chamber and choice point are perfectly aligned, thereby aligning all three holes perfectly (the two choice point holes of the body and the flu holding chamber of the lift).</li><li>The holderâs main purpose is to stabilize the body and lift in the loading position as you put the flies into the loading mouth of the T-maze (Figure 1A).</li><li>The plug is important for collecting neutral flies and is used to block one side of choice point holes, forcing the neutral flies into a fresh empty vial on the opposing side for counting.</li><li>The entire T-maze body and lift can be fully dismantled (by carefully removing the six bolts) and cleaned with detergent and/or alcohol. Be careful not lose any of the bolts in disassembly and do not remove any of the elastic holding screws. Allow to thoroughly dry before reassembly and use.<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Light Sources optimization for controls<ol class="npwtwo"><li>You should have a large table or work bench in the behavior room with a set point in the middle for the T-maze to be placed (Figure 5).</li><li>Perpendicular to the set point, place a long piece of tape that extends 100 cm in either direction (2 metres in total) (Figure 5A). With the set point marked as zero, use a ruler and label the tape every 5 cm with its corresponding distance away from the set point, moving outward until you reach the end of the tape (<em>i.e.</em>, the end of the tape should be 100 cm at both ends). Use these marks as the reference points when you place your light sources away from the set point.</li><li>Optimize the distance that the light sources are placed away from the choice point for your control group(s). You will have to perform several trials with the light sources at varying distance from the choice point.</li><li>Once your control flies consistently distribute evenly between the two light sources and show a preference index of 0, record the distances the light sources are at and use those for the remainder of the experiments that you are comparing with that controls. Perform this individually with âUV vs. blueâ (Figure 5B), âUV vs. greenâ (Figure 5C), and âblue vs. greenâ paradigms.</li><li>If the light sources are too intense (<em>i.e.</em>, flies move towards a light source regardless of distance), placing a kimwipe supported by an elastic is a crude method that can be used to decrease the intensity of the light source (Figure 5A).<br/><em>Note: A more elaborate approach by Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010 using a spectroradiometer and resistor to manually adjust the intensity of the LED light sources can also be employed to normalize the light source intensities so that the wild type flies have a preference index of 0. Instead of moving the light sources, the LEDs can be placed at the end of the vials and their intensities can be manually adjusted until the flies are consistently evenly distributed between the two light sources after each trial. For further details on this method, refer to Yamaguchi <em>et al.</em>, 2010 for a description of their rationale and how they accomplished this.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200314/20200314102728_4268.jpg" width="90"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.

Need to have enough vials for 5-10 trials, but make sure that the number of flies per vial is consistent through out the experiments you will compare statistically.</li><li>Move flies into behavior room the day before performing experiment.</li><li>When ready to perform experiment, ensure that the T-maze is clean, the lift slides smoothly in the body, and that all 3 elastics are attached (two for supporting vials, one for pulling the lift).</li><li>Pull back and insert both pins into the lift, then mount the T-maze on the holder so that the loading mouth is facing upwards. The holding chamber for the lift should be exposed and perfectly in line with the loading mouth.</li><li>Put down a flipping pad and flip the flies into the T-maze by tapping down the vial with the flies, remove the cap, and quickly invert the vial upside down into the loading mouth so that the flies will fall into it. Hold the vial of flies to the T-maze with one hand and the holder to the T-maze with the other hand and aggressively tap the T-maze repeatedly against the flipping pad so that all the flies in the vials fall into the loading mouth.</li><li>Once all flies are in the fly holding chamber quickly pull the first pin so that the T-maze is in the holding state and the flies are within the fly holding chamber at the intermediate zone.</li><li>Orientate the T-maze so that it is in line with your light sources (make sure that they are off at the is point) and place two empty vials on either side of the choice point holes and secure with elastic bands.</li><li>Keep flies in the intermediate zone for 90 s in the dark and when ready, quickly turn on the light sources and pull the final pin. The elastic will pull the lift from the holding to the open state (Videos 1 and 2).</li><li>Leave flies in the open state for 20 seconds. The flies should be exposed to both light sources and should move from the choice point into the two vials (Videos 1 and 2).</li><li>After the experimental time is finished, gently pull back the lift to the first pinhole and insert the pin. This will put the maze into the holding state and separate the flies into 3 groups (light source A, light source B, and neutral).</li><li>Using the CO<sub>2</sub>, gently insert the needle in the top of the vial by pulling back on the vial slightly so that it makes a small space to put the needle in.</li><li>Knock out the flies in each individual vial, invert the T-maze and tap them into the empty vial and label with the light source it represents.</li><li>To remove the neutral flies (that did not choose between either light source), insert the plug into one of the choice point holes and place a vial in the opposing choice point hole. Then remove the pin and gently move the lift back to the open state. As done with the previous two vials, anesthetize, invert, and tap the neutral flies into a labeled empty vial.</li><li>Empty the labeled vials individually onto a CO<sub>2</sub> pad and count the number of flies separately, corresponding to the light sources they preferred.</li><li>Record data and determine the preference index.</li><li>5-10 trials should be performed per genotype. Increasing the number of trials may be necessary.<br/><br/><!--video3558-1å¼å§--><div class="videodiv" id="vd3558-1" style="height:480px;"></div><div class="videophoto" id="vp3558-1"><a class="newapic" href="javascript:;" onclick="openvideo(1)" style="background:url('https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/video/3558/3558-1s.jpg') no-repeat center center #000 !important;"> <img class="videopic" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/imagesUP/indexCover/videopalybtn.png" style="cursor:pointer !important;"/> </a> </div><div class="videostrong"><strong>Video 1.
