            <h1>Evaluating Whole Blood Clotting <em>in vitro</em> on Biomaterial Surfaces</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Roberta M Sabino, Ketul  C Popat</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Biomaterial-associated thrombosis is still a major concern for blood-contacting implants. After the medical device is implanted and comes in contact with blood, several complex reactions occur, which may lead to thrombus formation and failure of the device. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the biomaterial interaction with the whole blood. Several studies have been reported in the literature that evaluate different steps in the coagulation cascade, such as protein adsorption, plasma activation, and platelet adhesion <em>in vitro</em>, however, evaluation of whole blood clotting on biomaterial surfaces is not widely reported. Here, a protocol to evaluate whole blood clotting <em>in vitro</em> on 2D biomaterials surfaces via a simple and fast hemolysis assay is presented. Whole human blood is placed onto the biomaterial surfaces and is allowed to clot for different time periods. After the specific time intervals, the surfaces are transferred into deionized (DI) water to release the free hemoglobin and the absorbance of this solution is measured. The absorbance value is proportional to the free hemoglobin concentration in the DI water due to lysis of red blood cells and gives an indirect correlation to the extent of blood clotting on the biomaterial surfaces. This protocol provides a fast, facile and effective method to measure the anti-thrombogenic properties of biomaterials.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Investigating the blood clotting on medical devices is essential for successful development of biomaterials for implantable medical devices. Until now, no biomaterial surface has been truly able to prevent blood clotting (Sabino <em>et al.</em>, 2019). After contact with blood, the implant surface gets an adsorbed layer of blood protein, which can further activate the coagulation cascade, leading to platelet adhesion and activation, and finally to the development of the fibrin mesh (Gorbet and Sefton, 2004). Many published methods to investigate the anti-thrombogenic properties of biomaterials focus on studying the early stages of blood clotting, such as protein adsorption, and platelet adhesion and activation. Although they are important to understand the interaction between blood and the implant surface, these studies do not provide significant information about the overall coagulation process (Damodaran <em>et al.</em>, 2013; SimonâWalker <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Obstals <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>Preventing whole blood clotting on surfaces is crucial for long term success of blood-contacting implants. The formation of a fibrin clot is one of the latest stages of thrombosis, and this fibrin mesh traps the red blood cells (Leszczak <em>et al.</em>, 2013). In this protocol, human blood is allowed to clot on biomaterial surface for up to 45 min. When the surface is transferred to DI water, only the red blood cells that are not trapped in the fibrin mesh are dissolved in water and get lysed due to pressure change. Hemolysis is the rupture of the red blood cells, followed by the release of their components, such as hemoglobin. Thus, a higher amount of hemoglobin released indicates less blood clotting on the surface. Positive control with just blood in DI water is prepared and is considered the maximum hemoglobin release. The absorbance measured at a wavelength of 540 nm is directly proportional to the concentration of free hemoglobin in water (Sabino <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Therefore, a higher absorbance value indicates higher hemoglobin concentration, which means less clotting on the biomaterial surface.<br/></p>
