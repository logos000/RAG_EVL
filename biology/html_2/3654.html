            <h1>Superresolution Microscopy of<em> Drosophila </em>Indirect Flight Muscle Sarcomeres</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Sarcomeres are extremely highly ordered macromolecular assemblies where proper structural organization is an absolute prerequisite to the functionality of these contractile units. Despite the wealth of information collected, the exact spatial arrangement of many of the H-zone and Z-disk proteins remained unknown. Recently, we developed a powerful nanoscopic approach to localize the sarcomeric protein components with a resolution well below the diffraction limit. The ease of sample preparation and the near crystalline structure of the <em>Drosophila</em> flight muscle sarcomeres make them ideally suitable for single molecule localization microscopy and structure averaging. Our approach allowed us to determine the position of dozens of H-zone and Z-disk proteins with a quasi-molecular, ~5-10 nm localization precision. The protocol described below provides an easy and reproducible method to prepare individual myofibrils for dSTORM imaging. In addition, it includes an in-depth description of a custom made and freely available software toolbox to process and quantitatively analyze the raw localization data.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Structure of the sarcomeres has been studied in details by X-ray crystallography as well as with various EM methods leading to quasi-atomic models of the thin and thick filaments from numerous species. However, although these examinations resulted in a remarkably good understanding of the actin-myosin overlap region, spatial arrangement of the I-band and H-zone complexes remained largely unknown. Recent advances in fluorescent super-resolution microscopy (also called nanoscopy) provide spatial resolutions that are well below the diffraction limit. Most notably, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can deliver localization maps of multiprotein complexes with very high precision, virtually attaining a single protein size resolution (Sigal <em>et al. </em>, 2018).<br/> <br/>We recently developed a standardized, powerful nanoscopic approach, combined with a structure averaging algorithm, that allowed us to determine the position of 27 muscle proteins in 1 day old adult <em>Drosophila</em> indirect flight muscles (IFMs) with a quasi-molecular, ~5-10 nm localization precision. By using this protein localization atlas, and by means of template based protein structure modeling, we assembled a refined I-band and H-zone model with an unparalleled scope and resolution (Szikora <em> et al. </em>, 2020). For our approach individual myofibrils were isolated from the IFM of <em>Drosophila</em> as described previously (Burkart <em>et al. </em>, 2007; Weitkunat and Schnorrer, 2014), with minor modifications. Individual muscle fibers of the flight muscle are ideal candidates for SMLM because they exhibit an extremely regular structural organization; their intrinsic auto-fluorescence is negligible, and they can be isolated very easily in large numbers. In addition, thickness of the fibers is below ~1.5 Âµm, therefore the fluorophores can be easily pumped into their dark, non-fluorescent state. As the focal plane is parallel to the myofibrils we can acquire two-dimensional projections of the sarcomeres which reveal the lateral distribution of proteins at the H-zones and I-bands. Since highly specific antibodies are available against different components of the sarcomere, and the organic fluorophores exhibit certain advantageous characteristics, <em> i.e. </em>, high brightness and photostability, we recommend the use of conventional immunofluorescent labeling. Typically, an SMLM measurement generates tens of thousands of microscopic images, to record hundreds of thousands of âsingle molecule eventsâ. To evaluate these large datasets we developed a standardized data-flow protocol. For processing and quantification of the raw localization datasets, we developed a user friendly and freely available software tool (IFM Analyzer) with a detailed user guide including a sample dataset. We trust that with some minor modifications, our approach and the software tools developed can also be used for structural studies of similarly regular or quasi-regular molecular assemblies, such as synaptonemal complexes or chemical synapses.</p>

Our preliminary tests using this buffer produced similar results without the time constrain of the oxygen scavenging system.</li><li>We primarily used conventional immunofluorescent labeling, however we also tested some other approaches. For example, proteins can be localized through tags, such as GFP or FLAG. These studies are clearly appealing, as high quality primary antibodies are often missing, and in addition, in the tag based localization approaches position of the epitope is precisely known. Provided that functional equivalence of the tagged and the native proteins has been confirmed with an appropriate test (<em>e.g.</em>, rescue experiment), this can be a very powerful approach. In our experience the commercially available GFP antibodies (<em>e.g.</em>, Thermo Fisher, <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> A6455 </a> ) and nanobodies (<em>e.g.</em>, Chromotek, <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> gb2AF647 </a> ) are ideal for dSTORM imaging, and the FLAG antibodies (<em>e.g.</em>, Sigma Aldrich, <a class="blackNoUnder" target="_blank"> F7425 </a> ) are also usable.</li><li>One potential disadvantage of conventional immunofluorescent labeling of individual myofibrils is that antibody penetration/epitope accessibility can be limited in the compact IFM due to the size of the antibodies. In this regard, due to their small size, nanobodies are expected to offer an improvement; in addition, they may increase localization precision as they reduce the epitope to fluorophore distance. Our preliminary data suggest that indeed, nanobodies are able to improve accessibility, however, our approach needs to be further optimized before making a strong conclusion about resolution.</li><li>So far the <em>Drosophila</em> IFM was our major model system, however, our first set of preliminary data revealed that this approach is relatively easily adaptable to individual myofibers isolated from mice, and most likely to other non-drosophila myofibrils as well.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34364">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>2x Relaxing solution<br/>40 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0<br/>10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>10 mM EGTA<br/>10 mM ATP<br/>10 mM DTT<br/>2 mM PMSF<br/>Store at -20 Â°C and use within 6 months</li><li>1x Relaxing solution<br/>Mix the 2x relaxing solution with ddH<sub>2</sub>O 1:1 (v/v)<br/>Prepare freshly and keep on ice during sample preparation</li><li>Dissection solution<br/>Mix the 2x relaxing solution with glycerol 1:1 (v/v)<br/>Prepare freshly and keep on ice during sample preparation</li><li> Fixative solution<br/>Mix the 2x relaxing solution with 16% paraformaldehyde and ddH<sub>2</sub>O 2:1:1 (v/v)<br/>Prepare freshly and keep on ice during sample preparation</li><li>Blocking solution<br/>5% (v/v) Goat serum<br/>0.3% (v/v) Trition X-100<br/>in PBS<br/>Store at 4 Â°C and use within one week</li><li>dSTORM imaging buffer (GLOX)<br/>4% (w/v) glucose<br/>2,000 U/ml glucose-oxidase<br/>40,000 U/ml catalase<br/>25 mM NaCl<br/>22 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane<br/>4 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)<br/>100 mM Î²-mercaptoethylamine (MEA)<br/>The imaging buffer must be freshly prepared for each experiment, since its lifetime is limited to a few (~3) hours.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34365">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">The protocol described here in more details has been published in Szikora <em>et al.</em>, 2020.
