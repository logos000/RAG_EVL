            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Depending on its concentration and cellular origin the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the organism serves a variety of functions. While high concentrations during an oxidative burst are used to fight pathogens, low to moderate amounts of ROS act as signaling molecules important for several physiological processes such as regulation of immune responses. The ROS-sensitive dye 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) is an inexpensive and well-established tool for measuring intracellular ROS levels. However, it needs to be carefully controlled to be able to draw firm conclusions on the nature of ROS species produced and the cellular source of ROS generation such as the enzyme complex NADPH-oxidase 2 (NOX-2). In this protocol, a robust method to determine low intracellular ROS production using H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA was validated by several ROS-specific as well as NOX-2-specific inhibitors. Cells were treated with inhibitors or control substances prior to treatment with the ROS-inducer of interest. H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA was added only for the last 30 min of the treatment schedule. To terminate its conversion, we used a ROS-specific inhibitor until analysis by flow cytometry within the FITC-channel (Ex: 488 nm/Em: 519 nm). In summary, this protocol allows the detection of signaling-relevant intracellular ROS production in cell lines and primary immune cells (<em>e.g.</em>, Mono Mac 6 cells and Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, respectively). Using this method in combination with specific inhibitors, we were able to validate even exceptionally low amounts of ROS produced by NOX-2 and relevant for immune-regulatory signaling.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be generated in different cellular compartments such as peroxisomes, the cytosol, at mitochondrial membranes, or at the plasma membrane (Di Meo <em>et al.</em>, 2016). High concentrations of ROS can damage all major cellular constituents and are, thus, a lethal threat for living organisms. High amounts of ROS produced in a short period of time (often called oxidative burst) are important for the immune system to fight pathogens. Persistence of excessive ROS production is associated with several diseases such rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus and neurodegenerative diseases. Low concentrations of superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and derivatives thereof, however, have been described to act as essential regulators in cellular signaling cascades (DrÃ¶ge, 2002). The plasma membrane-bound complex NADPH-oxidase 2 (NOX-2) is one of the main O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> producers in phagocytes such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. The active NOX-2 complex is formed by 6 subunits (gp91phox, p22phox, Rac2, p40phox, p47phox and p67phox), which allow a tight regulation of NOX-2 activity. NOX-2 can produce both, low and high levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> that are rapidly converted into hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; Giardino <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Belambri <em>et al.</em>, 2018). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is comparatively stable and is responsible for both, intra- and extracellular effector functions. High amounts of NOX-2-derived O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> produced by neutrophils in phagosomes are important to kill bacteria via direct oxidative damage. In contrast, low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> fulfill essential intra- as well as intercellular second-messenger functions for the regulation of, e.g., immune responses (Bienert <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Holmdahl <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Thus, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were demonstrated to enhance the expression of interleukin-2 in activated T cells (Roth and DrÃ¶ge, 1987) and to inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in phagocytes (Jendrysik <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Sareila <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Singel and Segal, 2016; Bode <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Accordingly, loss of functional NOX-2 has been associated with dysregulated immune responses and several autoimmune diseases such as Lupus erythematosus and Crohnâs-like inflammatory bowel disease (Lee <em>et al.</em>, 2011; OâNeill <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Rosenzweig, 2008; Singel and Segal, 2016).<br/><br/>Several protocols have been established for the detection of free radical production in cells which use either lucigenin, chemiluminescence of luminol, xylenol orange or 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) as tools for the detection of intracellular ROS production (Gyllenhammar, 1987; Dahlgren and Karlsson, 1999; Nourooz-Zadeh, 1999). H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA is one of the most frequently used chemicals to investigate the intracellular redox state. Other sensitive and direct approaches for measuring H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> have also been described such as the <em>Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit</em> (Karakuzu <em>et al.</em>, 2019). However, this relatively expensive tool measures extracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and might not detect low amounts of intracellular ROS. In contrast, low cost, easy handling, high sensitivity, and the possibility to use it in kinetic approaches are important advantages of H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA over other established tools. H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA enters cells by diffusion and is converted into the non-permeable derivate H<sub>2</sub>DCF, which can then be oxidized by ROS into fluorescent 2â,7â-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). An alternative protocol for measuring ROS using H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA has been published by Eruslanov and Kusmartsev (Eruslanov and Kusmartsev, 2010). Of note, H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA lacks specificity for O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> radicals and instead reacts with several O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> conversion products such as alkoxyl, carbonate, peroxyl, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, as well as OH<sup>-</sup> radicals (Ischiropoulos <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Bilski <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Eruslanov and Kusmartsev, 2010). Moreover, H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA is prone for artificial conversion mediated, <em>e.g.</em>, by light exposure or by direct or indirect oxidation <em>via</em> cytochrome c released during apoptosis (Kalyanaraman <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Hence, the detection of ROS by H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA must be carefully controlled to confirm cell-dependent ROS production as well as the enzyme of origin such as NOX-2 (Bilski <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Ohashi <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Eruslanov and Kusmartsev, 2010). In order to further specify the source and species of the measured ROS, different ROS-specific inhibitors (6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid; Trolox, N-Acetyl cysteine; NAC, and catalase) as well as NOX-2-specific inhibitors (sgp91 ds-tat and GSK2795039) are highly recommended.<br/><br/>The following protocol incorporates the use of specific inhibitors to enable a robust detection of low ROS levels in cell lines (Mono Mac 6 (MM6) cells, Jurkat T cells, <em>etc.</em>) and primary immune cells (Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, <em>etc.</em>). Next to the use of inhibitors as pre-treatment to differentiate source and species mediated by the ROS-inducer of interest (see Table 1), the general ROS scavengers Trolox or NAC are used to stop the reaction of H<sub>2</sub>DCF to DCF at the end of the experimental treatment. The latter ensures that only ROS which are produced during the experimental setting are measured and prevents unwanted conversion not related to the treatment such as responses to stress during washing and the final measurement. By using this protocol, highly reproducible detection of intracellular ROS production in signaling-relevant concentrations can be performed (Bode <em>et al.</em>, 2019).</p>
