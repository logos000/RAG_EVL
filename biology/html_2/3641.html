            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) by hormones and neurotransmitters elicits cellular responses, many of which result from alterations in the concentrations of cytosolic cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Here, we describe a microplate reader fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay that uses the genetically encoded biosensors H188 and YC3.60 so that it is possible to monitor the kinetics with which alterations of [cAMP] or [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] occur in monolayers or suspensions of living cells exposed to GPCR agonists. This protocol uses HEK293 cell lines doubly transfected with a FRET biosensor and a recombinant GPCR of interest (<em>e.g.</em>, glucagon receptors, CCK<sub>2</sub> receptors, or NPY2R receptors). The protocol allows for rapid screening of small molecule GPCR agonists and antagonists, and it is also useful for discovery of synthetic mono-, dual-, and tri- agonist peptides with GPCR activating properties.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays in combination with microscopy and digital imaging technologies are commonly used to monitor the kinetics with which levels of cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuate in response to GPCR agonist stimulation. Here, we report an alternative approach that does not use microscopy but that instead enables FRET-based detection of cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a 96-well format using an automated microspectrofluorimeter and monolayers or suspensions of living cells. The protocol uses genetically encoded biosensors so that averaged kinetic data for pharmacological studies can be obtained in real time using a microplate reader under conditions in which GPCR agonists are applied at known concentrations. These FRET assays use cell lines stably expressing the cAMP biosensor H188 (Klarenbeek <em>et al.</em>, 2015) or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensor YC3.60 (Nagai <em>et al.</em>, 2004), both of which exhibit superior dynamic range in comparison to earlier FRET reporters. Our protocol describes how H188 or YC3.60 can be expressed stably with recombinant GPCRs so that precise dose-response analysis is achievable. This protocol builds on our published studies, whereby novel dual agonist and triagonist properties of synthetic GPCR agonist peptides (<em>e.g.</em>, EP45 and GGP817) were discovered (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2018 and 2019).<br/> <br/>Using the genetically encoded biosensor Epac1-camps (Nikolaev <em>et al.</em>, 2004), we were the first to develop a 96-well microplate FRET assay in which fluctuations of [cAMP] were monitored in monolayers of living cells in real time using a microspectrofluorimeter (FlexStation 3, Molecular Devices) (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2009). More recently, we have optimized this approach for purposes of drug discovery in a high-throughput mode. The major technical advance concerns our use of H188 and YC3.60, both of which we find to be highly responsive to cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, respectively. Importantly, our plate reader FRET assays using H188 or YC3.60 require their high-level expression, either by stable transfection to generate clonal cell lines (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2018), or by adenoviral transduction of cell lines (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2018 and 2019). Transient transfection is not useful since low-level expression of these biosensors is not compatible with the limited light detection limits of available microplate readers.<br/> <br/>For the H188 reporter expressed in our clonal C24 HEK293 cell line, the cAMP-elevating agent forskolin induces a maximal 100% increase of the 485/535 âFRET ratio, a response that greatly exceeds the 12% value typically observed using Epac1-camps (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2009 and 2018). This C24 clone exhibits high sensitivity (EC<sub>50</sub> 500 nM) and excellent Z-score (0.77) when testing forskolin (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Calibration of the FRET signal is obtained in assays that use digitonin-permeabilized C24 cells expressing H188 and that are bathed in known concentrations of cAMP (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2018). When administering forskolin by its bolus injection into individual wells of a microplate containing monolayers of C24 cells, the time course of adenylyl cyclase activation and resultant cAMP production is monitored with high precision within the first 30 s.<br/> <br/>We have also created doubly-transfected HEK293 cells lines that stably express H188 or YC3.60 along with recombinant GPCRs of interest. These GPCRs include glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), peptide YY (PYY), corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors. It is also possible to perform such FRET assays using HEK293 cells that stably express H188 or YC3.60, but are instead transiently transfected with a GPCR. Conversely it is possible to use a cell line that stably expresses a recombinant GPCR so that cells may then be virally transduced with H188 or YC3.60.<br/> <br/>Our real-time kinetic assay using H188 and living cells differs from single-endpoint HTR-FRET assays that monitor levels of cAMP in cell lysates. For example, the LANCE<sup>Â®</sup> <em>cAMP assay (Perkin Elmer)</em> uses a Europium-labeled cAMP tracer (FRET donor) in combination with a fluorophore-tagged anti-cAMP antibody (FRET acceptor), both of which are added to a reaction mixture so that the competition of fluorescent cAMP and non-fluorescent cAMP (<em>i.e.</em>, endogenous cAMP) for the anti-cAMP binding site on the antibody can be measured. In contrast, H188 is unimolecular in which the cAMP-binding protein Epac1 is flanked by the FRET donor mTurquoise2â and the FRET acceptor cp173 Venus-Venus so that a decrease of FRET occurs upon binding cAMP (Klarenbeek <em>et al.</em>, 2015). YC3.60 instead uses a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain of calmodulin (CaM), and the CaM-binding peptide M13, in combination with the FRET donor ECFPâ11, and the FRET acceptor cp173Venus so that an increase of FRET occurs upon binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Nagai <em>et al.</em>, 2004). Unlike HTR-FRET assays, H188 and YC3.60 allow live-cell real-time determinations of FRET in the kinetic mode.<br/> <br/>Summarized below is a detailed FRET assay protocol that provides additional technical information not previously contained in the methods sections of our prior publications (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2009, 2018 and 2019). We also present new information concerning previously unpublished methodology that allows GPCR agonist action to be studied in cells that stably express <em>both</em> a recombinant GPCR and a select FRET biosensor.</p>

Peptide YY(3-36) lowers levels of cAMP in HEK293-NPY2R-H188 c18 cells.</strong> A. HEK293/hNPY2R/H188 c18 cells stably expressing the human NPY2R receptor and H188 were allowed to adhere to an RTC-coated reading plate for overnight culture. On day 2 the ability of forskolin alone to raise levels of cAMP was monitored (red trace). Note that this action of forskolin was dose-dependently reduced when the NPY2R agonist PYY(3-36) (1-10 nM) was administered 125 s prior to administration of forskolin using a "double injection protocol". PYY(3-36) binds to NPY2R to activate G<sub>i</sub> proteins and to lower adenylyl cyclase activity, whereas forskolin directly stimulates adenylyl cyclase. Thus, this assay monitors the opposing actions of PYY(3-36) and forskolin to control levels of cAMP. Non-linear regression analysis of the data demonstrated that the IC<sub>50</sub> for PYY(3-36) action in this cell line was 2.1 nM. Non-linear regression analysis was performed with Origin 8 software using the highest âFRET values for each data point. Note that the time scale is 1,200 s, thereby revealing short and long-term actions of forskolin and PYY(3-36) in this assay. B. Converse experiment in comparison to A in which forskolin was administered prior to PYY(3-36) using HEK293/hNPY2R/H188 c18 cells and the double injection protocol. Note that the time scale is 400 s, thereby revealing the fast action of PYY(3-36) (1 Î¼M) to reduce the rate of increase of âFRET. This NPY2R-mediated action of PYY(3-36) signifies G<sub>i</sub> protein-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with resultant lowering of cAMP levels, as detected using H188.</li></ol></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34204">### Data analysis</p><ol class="npwone"><li>Analysis using SoftMax Pro v.5.4.6.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>After reading is finished, save the SoftMax Pro file with experimental data.</li><li>Use the SoftMax Pro export filter to create a .txt file containg FRET ratio values for each well of the plate.</li><li>Import the .txt file using Origin 8 to create a âSingle ASCIIâ file.</li><li>Use Origin 8 to calculate the mean Â± S.D. ratio value for each selected group of wells.</li><li>Use Origin 8 to plot mean ratio values <em>vs</em> time in graphical format.</li><li>Use the nonlinear regression analysis package in Origin 8 to analyse highest âFRET ratio values for each concentration of test substance so that dose-reponse relationships and EC<sub>50</sub> values can be determined based on curve fitting (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2018 and 2019).</li><li>Box and Whisker plots are generated using Origin 8 to display intra-assay variability of mean ratios obtained from vehicle or drug treated cells (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2018 and 2019).</li><li>ANOVA tests in combination with Tukey HSD tests are used to establish if significant differences (<em>P</em> &lt; 0.05) exist between mean ratio values obtained for cells treated with vehicle or test solutions (Chepurny <em>et al.</em>, 2018 and 2019).<br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Analysis using SoftMax Pro v.7: Please see Video 2<br/>See Video 2 âFlexStation 3 data analysisâ for details.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti34205">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Standard Extracellular Saline (SES) Solution, pH 7.4<br/>138 mM NaCl<br/>5.6 mM KCl<br/>1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub><br/>2.6 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub><br/>10 mM HEPES<br/>11 mM Glucose<br/>0.1% BSA<br/>Sterilized by 0.2 Î¼m vacuum filtration<br/>Store at 4 Â°C</li><li>Rat Tail Collagen (RTC) Coating Solution (for one 96-well plate)<br/>5.5 ml MilliQ water<br/>6.3 Î¼l Glacial Acetic Acid<br/>95 Î¼l Rat Tail Collagen<br/><em>Note: Prepare fresh before use.
