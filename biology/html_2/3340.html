<p class="ppzz">In Procedure A 4, page 3 of our Bio-protocol paper <a href="https://bio-protocol.org/e2531" target="_blank">https://bio-protocol.org/e2531</a>, the dilute concentration â100 Î¼g/Î¼lâ is incorrect, should be â10 Î¼g/Î¼lâ. Consequently, the volume added into DCs is â40 Î¼lâ, the final volume should be â1.04 mlâ. Figure 1 has the same mistake. The correct text should be:<br/><br/>4. On Day 6, the cells are pulsed with OVA (400 Î¼g/ml) for 24 h. In detail, OVA is diluted by PBS at <strong>10</strong> Î¼g/Î¼l first and then added into DCs at <strong>40</strong> Î¼l per well. The final volume is <strong>1.04</strong> ml per well. At least 2 wells of cells are untreated with OVA as negative control for the reaction.<br/><br/>The revised Figure 1 is:<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190801/20190801230637_4616.jpg" width="185"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. OVA pulsed DCs preparation.</strong> Bone marrow cells are isolated from B6 mice and cultured in completed medium with GM-CSF and IL-4 for 7 days. Half/half medium is changed on Day 2. BM-DCs are stimulated with IFN-Î³ on Day 5 for 48 h and are pulsed with OVA on Day 6 for 24 h. Cells are harvested on Day 7 and washed thoroughly before using.</p><p class="pptt">### References</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Cai, S., Fujino, M., Lu, L. and Li, X.
