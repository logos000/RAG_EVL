            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Mimicking the various facets of human psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders in animal models is a challenging task. Nevertheless, mice have emerged as a widely used model system to study pathophysiology and treatment strategies for these diseases. However, the corresponding behavioral tests are often elaborate and require extensive experience in behavioral testing. Here, we present protocols for two simple assays, nest building and nestlet shredding, that can serve as a starting point for the behavioral phenotyping of mouse models with (potential) features of psychiatric disorders. Both tests have been reported previously and we extend prior descriptions by including adaptations and refinements derived from our practical experience, like the use of the home cage instead of a fresh cage for nestlet shredding. Summarized, we provide ready-to-use protocols for two behavioral assays that allow the generation of robust data with minimal time and cost expenditure and enable an initial assessment of features of psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders in mouse models of these diseases.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Due to the unmatched complexity of the human brain, it is difficult to model features of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diseases using animal models. However, in spite of some limitations, in mice an impressive battery of tests targeting numerous individual aspects of these disorders has been developed in recent years (Seong <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Ricceri <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Sukoff Rizzo and Crawley, 2017). Many of these assays are now widely accepted as valid tools to study disease mechanisms or therapeutic approaches. Here, we demonstrate two simple tests, nestlet shredding and nest building, widely used to study potential features of psychiatric and, particularly, neurodevelopmental disorders that we have – among others – used recently to characterize the behavioral phenotype of mice with a genetically caused deficiency to synthesize ether lipids (Dorninger <em>et al.</em>, 2019a) (cf. Figure 1). The latter are compounds performing a wide range of biological activities, ranging from structural maintenance of cellular membranes to signal transduction (Dorninger <em>et al.</em>, 2017a; Dorninger <em>et al.</em>, 2020), and are particularly important for correct functioning of the brain (Berger <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Accordingly, ether lipid-deficient mice present with complex behavioral abnormalities including motor disturbances, hyperactivity and memory deficits as well as restricted social interaction and interest in novel objects (Dorninger <em>et al.</em>, 2017b; Dorninger <em>et al.</em>, 2019a; Dorninger <em>et al.</em>, 2019b).<br/><br/>Both of the presented assays have several obvious advantages: They are low-cost experiments, by which a significant amount of data can be obtained in a relatively short time frame. Furthermore, they can be reliably performed by investigators with only modest experience in behavioral analysis. Both tests are hardly dependent on physical abilities of the animals, thus allowing the use of genetically modified mouse models with marked phenotypes. For example, we used mice with considerable developmental defects and visual impairments (the ether lipid-deficient <em>Gnpat</em> knockout (KO) mouse model) (Rodemer <em>et al.</em>, 2003), which precluded the application of many behavioral tests. However, as demonstrated by their performance in the nest building assay (Dorninger <em>et al.</em>, 2019a), the animals are perfectly capable to utilize nestlets. Certainly, the simplicity of the assays also comes with some caveats: Both tests provide only an initial estimation on potential features of neurodevelopmental disorders and should not be used isolated. Also, they do not yield numeric data that can be directly related to the extent of human disease. Instead, they need to be complemented by additional behavioral tests assessing similar features (Silverman <em>et al.</em>, 2010) and, optimally, embedded in a battery of assays allowing a comprehensive description of the behavioral phenotype. Furthermore, results need to be interpreted with care: Excessive nestlet shredding is generally seen as an indicator of repetitive behavior, a symptom also seen in human autism spectrum disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorder (Angoa-Perez <em>et al.</em>, 2013). On the contrary, reduced engagement in the task may be viewed as restricted interest in novel objects, another feature commonly associated with autism (Bernard <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Dorninger <em>et al.</em>, 2019a). We feel that both interpretations are valid but need to be considered in the context of other aspects of behavior of a certain mouse model. Nest building, in turn, can be indicative of general well-being, distress or pain (Jirkof, 2014). At the same time, impairments in this task could hint towards structural or functional deficits in the brain, as demonstrated by mouse models of brain injury or with genetic modifications (Lijam <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Deacon <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Sager <em>et al.</em>, 2010).<br/><br/>Our procedures for both tests are based on the previous protocols (Deacon, 2006; Angoa-Perez <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Neely <em>et al.</em>, 2019) that we have slightly modified. Furthermore, we provide more detailed descriptions of the testing protocols, including novel recommendations on the testing environment and extended illustration of the procedures and results, and share our experiences in test execution and analysis.</p>

In general, we recommend to make use of exclusion sparingly (if a statistical exclusion criterion is chosen, use &gt; 5-7 x SD;          Barbato <em>et al.</em>, 2011). We usually take the position that uncommon behavior in a certain behavioral task is insufficient to exclude animals, as this may create a bias in your analysis. Thus, only exclude animals that are obviously impaired (<em>e.g.</em>, hurt) or physically unable to perform the task. However, this should be done prior to performing the trial, in compliance with current ARRIVE guidelines (Percie du          Sert <em>et al.</em>, 2020).</p></li><li><p>Compare your test groups using the statistics software of your choice. In the case of normally distributed values, parametric tests may be used (<em>e.g.</em>, Studentâs <em>t</em>-test for comparison of two groups, one-way ANOVA for comparison of more than two groups). However, with the mouse strain that we used, a considerable number of values equaled to 0, thus precluding the use of parametric tests. In that case, use non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U-test (for comparison of two groups) or the Kruskal-Wallis test (for comparison of more than two groups).</p></li></ol></li><br/><li><p>Nest building test</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>For the assessment of nests, engage 2-3 independent investigators that were not involved in the testing procedure or in handling the mice.</p></li><li><p>Do not exclude animals, which did not engage in nest building.

Assessors must be blinded to the genotype or treatment group of the test animals.</p><br/><p><strong>Table 1.

Examples of nests reaching scores of 2 (A), 3 (B), 4 (C) and 5 (D) are shown. For all of these nests, the vote of two independent evaluators was unanimous. Note that grade 1 would correspond to an untouched nestlet. However, no animal graded lower than a score of 2 in our test cohort.</p><p><br/></p></li><li><p>Use non-parametric tests for comparison of your test groups at each time point.

However, in the mouse strain we used, this led to increased interest of the animals in the unfamiliar environment and less engagement in nestlet shredding. To avoid this kind of distraction, we performed the assay in the animalsâ home cage, which clearly increased shredding activity and generated more discriminative results (Figure 3).</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3863/bioprotoc-10-24-3863-g003.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 3. Different nestlet shredding activity in the home cage versus a fresh cage.</strong> The same cohort of mice (n = 8) was exposed to the nestlet shredding test in a cleaned cage filled with fresh bedding (âfresh cageâ) and, one week later to exclude habituation to the task, in their home cage. Connected data points derive from the same test animal. Note that the same shredding score (0 g in the fresh cage and 0.1 g in the home cage) was reached by three different mice. Statistical analysis was performed using paired Studentâs <em>t</em> test. *<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05</p></li><br/><li><p>Additional information can be gathered by repeating the nestlet shredding assay on consecutive days. However, for our purposes, we decided against repeated measurements to avoid habituation to the task.</p></li><li><p>We tested several types of nesting material for use in the nest building test. In our hands, nestlets proved to produce most reproducible results and led to a more discriminative performance compared with paper towels, customary kitchen roll (cut in stripes or uncut) or cotton wool (Figure 4). Please note that other authors suggested to conduct four consecutive trials with different types of material (Neely <em>et al.</em>, 2019), which may be considered as an alternative option.</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3863/bioprotoc-10-24-3863-g004.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 4. Comparison of different material types for use in the nest building test.</strong> Test animals were supplied with a sheet of customary kitchen roll (either uncut, A, or cut to stripes, B), a paper towel (cut to stripes, C), cotton wool (D) or a nestlet (E) and the nests produced after a trial period of 24 h are shown. For the present protocol, the nestlet was selected as the most suitable material, as it produced the most discriminative results.</p></li><br/><li><p>The time points, at which nests are analyzed in the nest building test, can be varied at the experimenterâs discretion. However, make sure to cover at least one overnight period, as this constitutes the animalsâ active phase, <em>i.e.</em>, we recommend a minimum of 12 h until the first analysis.</p></li><li><p>Mice of both sexes can be used for the presented tests. To minimize variability, male and female mice should be analyzed separately. However, keep in mind that in this case statistical correction for multiple comparisons may have to be performed.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, there are only limited constraints concerning the age of the test animals. Basically, adult animals of any age can be used. Yet, we generally recommend to keep the age range as narrow as possible for low variability. Also, the phenotype of genetically modified models may change with age, thus affecting performance in behavioral assays.</p></li><li><p>Both tests can be performed with the same cohort of animals. However, in order to avoid habituation to the nestlets, a resting interval of 7 days should be maintained between the tests.</p></li><li><p>In our experiments, we used mice of a mixed background strain (outbred C57BL/6 x CD1). These animals reliably showed nesting behavior. However, nesting has been reported to be highly strain-sensitive (Deacon, 2006 and 2012), thus baseline data should be obtained in a test cohort of your background strain. Average nestlet shredding activity in our strain was similar as described previously (Angoa-Perez <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Yet, we experienced considerable variability (Dorninger <em>et al.</em>, 2019a), thus emphasizing the need for statistical power calculation using baseline data before performing the assay in your test cohort.</p></li><li><p>In case you are working with a mouse strain/genotype/treatment condition that does not produce good nests, the percentage of nestlet material used for nest building can be taken as an alternative readout parameter. For this, weigh the nestlet prior to supplying it to the mice (step 4). After the trial, weigh the part of the nestlet that was not utilized for nest building and calculate the fraction of nestlet material that has been converted to the nest.</p></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti39311">### Acknowledgments</p><p>This work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, P24843-B24, P31082-B21 and I2738-B26) and RhizoKids International.
