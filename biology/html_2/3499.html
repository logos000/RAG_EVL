            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The ability to recognize and interact with members of the same species is essential for social communication. Investigating the neural substrates of social interest and recognition may offer insights into the behavioral differences present in disorders affecting social behavior. Assays used to study social interest in rodents include the 3-chamber test, a partition test, and a social interaction test. Here, we present a single protocol that can be used to quantify the level of social interest displayed by mice, the ability to distinguish between different individual mice (social recognition), and the level of repetitive self-grooming displayed. In the first part of the protocol, a social habituation/dishabituation test, the time spent by a test mouse sniffing a stimulus mouse is quantified over 9 trials. In the first 8 interactions, the same stimulus mouse is used repeatedly; on the ninth trial, a novel stimulus mouse is presented. Intact social recognition is indicated by a progressive decrease in the investigation time over trials 1-8, and an increase in trial 9. The interval between each social trial is used to quantify self-grooming, a stereotyped repetitive behavior in mice. We also present a method for randomized, blinded analysis of these behaviors to increase rigor and reproducibility of results. Therefore, this single behavioral test enables ready assessment of phenotypes of both social and repetitive behaviors in an integrated manner in the same animals. This feature can be advantageous in understanding interactions between these behaviors and phenotypes in mouse models with genetic variants associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders, which are often characterized by these behavioral differences.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Verbal and nonverbal communications enhance an organismâs ability to establish and maintain a social hierarchy, and thus survive and reproduce. These forms of communication rely on the motivation to interact with fellow conspecifics and the ability to recognize and distinguish between different individuals. In humans, disorders that are commonly characterized by altered social behavior include depression, anxiety, and autism (Saunders and Roy, 1999; White <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Although there is a general understanding of symptoms, the etiologies of these disorders, particularly the underlying mechanisms of social impairments and differences, remain unclear (Goldstein and Rosselli, 2003).<br/> <br/>Mice offer advantageous models for studying the neurobiology of behavior through similarities to certain aspects of human behavior and physiology (Austin <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Cryan and Holmes, 2005). Although a mouse model will not perfectly replicate human disease, overall symptoms can apply when investigating theories regarding genetic or environmental modulation (Crawley, 2007). For example, much of the current preclinical autism research revolves around the diagnostic criteria of abnormal social interaction, impaired social communication and interaction, and repetitive behaviors (Silverman <em>et al.</em>, 2010).<br/> <br/>A social habituation/dishabituation test enables measurement of two components of rodent social behavior: 1) the interest in a familiar social stimulus shown repeatedly over a short period of time; and 2) the ability to recognize a new social stimulus (Tejada and Rissman, 2012; Ujjainwala <em>et al.</em>, 2018). In this paradigm, the mouse used to provide a social stimulus is placed under a wire cup to confine it to a fixed location and to physically separate it from the mouse whose behavior is being examined (âtest mouseâ). Interest is measured by the amount of time the test mouse spends exploring the stimulus mouse under the wire cup, typically quantified through sniffing. This paradigm can be used to investigate biological and environmental influences on social interest and/or social recognition. For example, our group recently reported that mice genetically deficient for the diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) protein show a significant reduction in social interest compared to wild-type littermates, with no deficit in social recognition (Ujjainwala <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Furthermore, rodents often show sex differences in social interest levels (Tejada and Rissman, 2012; Karlsson <em>et al.</em>, 2015), and sex steroid hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, affect social exploratory behavior. Variations of this protocol have also been used to examine the loss of the oxytocin gene as well as lesions to the CA2 region of the hippocampus and their effect on social recognition (Ferguson <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Stevenson and Caldwell, 2014). In addition, this test could be applied to further evaluate the impacts of other environmental and behavioral factors, such as social isolation or gestational exposure to bisphenol A (Wolstenholme <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Lander <em>et al.</em>, 2017).<br/> <br/>Restricted repetitive behaviors are most often associated with autism in humans, but these behaviors are also present in other disorders such as Rett, Fragile X, and Prader-Willi syndromes (Crawley, 2007; McFarlane <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Lewis and Kim, 2009). In mice, this phenotype can present in numerous forms, including repetitive grooming, circling, jumping, or other stereotypical movements (Crawley, 2007). Given the overlap between impaired social interaction and repetitive behaviors in these and other neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, a single protocol that enables ready and integrated assessment of multiple phenotypes is advantageous.<br/> <br/>Another paradigm commonly used to study social interest and recognition in mice is the 3-chamber test. This test requires a specialized apparatus containing multiple chambers separated by removable doors. This configuration is of higher novelty to a mouse than an environment that mirrors the home cage, potentially inducing higher levels of general exploratory behavior rather than social interaction specifically (Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2011). By contrast, the test described in this protocol can be performed in a standard mouse cage used for daily housing in many laboratories. The other materials required can be obtained readily at a low cost.<br/> <br/>Blinded analyses significantly enhance experimental rigor, especially regarding manual scoring of behavior, where pre-conceptions may lead to biased evaluation. For any given study, requiring separate researchers to either conduct experiments or perform analyses is not always feasible and can lead to differences in interpretation. Here, we provide a method to randomly code, name, and sort files using Excel. This method allows for one person to conduct the behavioral test and then score the videos in a blinded fashion. This process could be used to anonymize other file types for blinded analysis as well.</p>

Interaction is defined as direct contact of the test mouseâs nose to the cup or stimulus mouse, or position of the test mouseâs nose within 1 cm of the wire cup, with the nose facing the stimulus mouse (Figure 7). Social interaction is analyzed from the time the cage top is placed on the cage to 1 min after. Evaluate and score 1 full minute with a stopwatch for each trial. Plot the data as shown in Figure 8A.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="50" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110003917_2042.jpg" width="158"/><br/><strong>Figure 7. Mouse engaging in âsocial interactionâ.</strong> In the image on the left, the test mouse is away from the cup and its nose is not within 1 cm of it. This behavior would not be counted as sniffing time. In the image on the right, the test mouseâs nose is making direct contact with the cup and facing toward the cup; this behavior is thus included in the sniffing time.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200110/20200110003949_2412.jpg" width="257"/><br/><strong>Figure 8. Example data from a habituation/dishabituation test.</strong> A. The social interest (sniffing time) of the test mouse (n = 1) decreases over the first 8 trials and increases for the 9<sup>th</sup> trial when the novel mouse is introduced. B. Repetitive self-grooming times in the 1<sup>st</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 8<sup>th</sup> trials. This example illustrates representative <em>Dbi<sup>+/+</sup></em> and <em>Dbi<sup>-/-</sup></em> mice (n = 1 each). Full comparisons between these genotypes are presented in Ujjainwala <em>et al.</em>, 2018.<br/><br/><strong><em>Repetitive self-grooming</em></strong><br/>Repetitive self-grooming can also be scored with a stopwatch using the portions of videos covering min 2-10 of each trial. Repetitive self-grooming is defined as a period of at least 10 s spent grooming, with no more than 5 s between consecutive grooming spurts (Silverman <em>et al.</em>, 2010). For an initial analysis, record self-grooming times for min 2-10 of trials 1, 4, and 8 to assess grooming at the beginning, middle, and end of testing. Plot the data as shown in Figure 8B. The remaining trials can be analyzed for repetitive grooming time if more comprehensive quantification is desired. If removing the stimulus mouse from the testing cage is not done consistently and rapidly for every trial, a different interval, such as min 3-10, may be used.<br/><br/><strong><em>Statistical analysis</em></strong> </p><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Enter data into SAS or other statistics software.</li><li>Analyze sniffing time and repetitive grooming time (in s) using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).</li><li>Enter trial as within-subjects factor, and enter sex and genotype as between-subjects factors.</li><li>To test for differences in social interest, compare sniffing time (in s) across trials 1-9 to test for significance. In addition, compare the total sniffing time summed across trials 1-8 to test for significant differences in total levels of interest displayed toward the first stimulus mouse.</li><li>To test for differences in social recognition, compare sniffing time (in s) across trials 8 and 9 to test for significance.</li><li>To test for differences in repetitive self-grooming, compare repetitive grooming time (in s) across the intertrial intervals for which grooming was quantified.</li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti31117">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Unless explicitly studying the effects of social isolation, all test mice should be group-housed until testing, as social isolation can lead to altered social behavior (Lander <em>et al.</em>, 2017).</li><li>Tests should be conducted at a consistent time of day. For example, our lab routinely performs these tests between 9:00 AM and 1:00 PM (relative to 7:00 PM lights off).</li><li>If possible, stimulus mice and test mice should be housed in different animal facility rooms. If that option is not available, physically separate the cages housing stimulus and test mice on a cage rack with at least one row in between. If the animal facility uses fully enclosed individually ventilated cages (IVCs), thus minimizing olfactory and pheromonal signals, separation such that there is no visual interaction is suggested.</li><li>The first time the stimulus mouse is placed under the cup should not be during an experiment. Stimulus mice tend to exhibit behaviors reflecting anxiety, such as clinging to wires of the cup or cage-biting, in response to initial exposure to the cup. Train the stimulus mice by using non-test mice prior to running experimental mice.</li><li>When transporting mice (test or stimulus) between cages, minimize the time the mouse is moved without having contact with a support surface underneath as hanging the mouse for significant time is a stressor for mice (Deacon, 2006). This support can be provided by placing the mouse on the sleeve of the investigatorâs forearm covered by a clean lab coat, or placing on top of a cage lid with light restraint on the tail.</li><li>In our studies, most mice continued to show habituation (as indicated by continued decreases in sniffing time) throughout the first 8 trials. However, if the test mice show stronger habituation earlier on, the number of trials prior to the âdishabituation phaseâ can potentially be reduced.</li><li>If the test mouse is spending a significant amount of time in a part of the cage obscured by the wire cup, consider positioning the camera to record from a top-down view.</li><li>Cross-validation of phenotypes across multiple behavioral assays can help solidify conclusions regarding the effect of a genetic mutation or other manipulation. Therefore, it may be advisable to test mice on another assay of social interest, such as the 3-chamber test (Yang <em>et al.</em>, 2011), in addition to the social habituation/dishabituation test presented here.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti31118">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">We thank Dr. Emilie Rissman for helpful advice regarding the social habituation/dishabituation test procedures.
