            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In order for the brain to function properly, a carefully orchestrated homeostasis must be maintained. To help regulate this delicate balance, the brain has developed a highly selective blood-brain barrier (BBB). Under normal conditions, the BBB excludes harmful blood-borne material from the brain parenchyma. However, numerous neuropathological conditions can disrupt this barrier, causing BBB permeability and subsequent CNS dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms involved in BBB permeability are essential to elucidating the pathology of various neurological disorders as well as identifying methods for drug delivery to the CNS. Here, we describe several <em>in vivo</em> methods to measure BBB permeability in mice using an array of diverse sized tracers including exogenous 376 Da fluorescein salt, 66.5 kDa bovine serum albumin, and 70 kDa dextran as well as endogenous 160 kDa mouse IgG. When administered intravenously, these substances are excluded from a healthy brain by the BBB. However, BBB dysfunction can allow entry of these tracers into the brain and this accumulation can be measured using spectrophotometry, fluorescent microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. We also describe a method to induce BBB permeability using <em>Clostridium perfringens </em>epsilon toxin. Finally, we include a short discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of each method and their appropriate downstream applications.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>To maintain the intricate homeostasis required for proper brain function, the central nervous system (CNS) has developed a selective barrier that stringently regulates movement of blood-borne material into the brain. This is called the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This barrier is generated by highly specialized brain endothelial cells (BEC) whose unique properties are influenced by the close contact of CNS pericytes and astrocytes (Balabanov and Dore-Duffy, 1998; Engelhardt, 2003; Abbott <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Abbott and Friedman, 2012; Alvarez <em>et al.</em>, 2013). This increased barrier activity is achieved using two main mechanisms in BEC. The first is reduced paracellular permeability via formation of tight junctions at cell-to-cell contacts and the second is decreased transcellular permeability through reduced pinocytic activity (Gloor <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Wolburg and Lippoldt, 2002; Preston <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Tietz and Engelhardt 2015; De Bock <em>et al.</em>, 2016). An increase in BBB permeability can have devastating neuropathological outcomes and can result in death. Because of the destructive consequences that BBB permeability can have on normal brain function, it is important to establish methods that reliably measure BBB permeability to help identify both the causes of and treatments for BBB dysfunction.<br/><br/>To measure BBB permeability <em>in vivo</em> in mice, animals are typically injected intravenously (IV) with a tracer or dye normally excluded from the brain by an intact BBB. The most commonly used tracer is Evans Blue (Saunders <em>et al.</em>, 2015). However, it has been argued that Evans Blue has significant limitations as a tracer for BBB permeability assays and has been extensively reviewed in Saunders <em>et al.</em> (2015). Because Evan Blue binds to plasma albumin, extraversion of Evans Blue into the CNS is reasoned to be a measurement of albumin permeability. However, it has been demonstrated that Evans Blue binds to several other plasma proteins and may even be present as a free dye, suggesting that Evans Blue is an unsuitable tracer for BBB permeability. To help reduce the amount of uncertainty of accessing BBB permeability with Evanâs Blue, we sought to identify tracers that were better characterized and would therefore allow us to better define the specific aspects involved in BBB dysfunction. For our purposes, we wished to identify the size of molecules a damaged BBB had become permeable to, indicating if certain blood proteins could cross the BBB. Extravasation of certain blood-borne proteins such as complement, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulins may have lasting pathological effects on the CNS even after a permeable BBB has been repaired. Based on these criteria, we selected a panel of easily detectable tracers including exogenous 376Da fluorescein salt (FITC-Na), 66.5 kDa Alexa fluor 594 conjugated bovine serum albumin (BSA-594), and 70 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated dextran (FITC-dextran); and the endogenous ~155 kDa tracer, mouse IgG.<br/><br/>In this paper, we outline procedures on how to use FITC-Na, BSA-594, -FITC-dextran, and endogenous IgG as tracers for BBB permeability and their acceptable downstream applications. In addition, we also describe a method to induce BBB permeability in mice using <em>Clostridium perfringens </em>epsilon toxin (ETX) (Linden <em>et al.</em>, 2019). ETX-induced BBB permeability opens the BBB to all the tracers described here, specifically through caveolae dependent-transcytosis using both receptor-mediated and fluid-phase mechanisms (Linden <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This panel allows us to access permeability to substances with varied molecular sizes and well as different molecular characteristics. FITC-Na can be used as a measure of solute and ion permeability, while BSA, 70 kDa dextran, and IgG can be used as measures of protein permeability (Nag, 2003). Influx of specific markers may also help identify what paracellular or transcellular mechanisms are involved in BBB dysfunction. For example, albumin transport is mediated via caveolae dependent-transcytosis (Schnitzer <em>et al.</em>, 1994; Schubert <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Frank <em>et al.</em>, 2003). However, specific mechanisms of BBB permeability need to be confirmed using additional experimental methods. We strongly suggest ultrastructure examination via electron microscopy to determine if permeability is a result of increased paracellular permeability via tight junction dysfunction or increased transcellular permeability because of elevated endocytic activity. We also describe the best methods to use to evaluate extravasation for each tracer, as some techniques are not compatible with certain tracers, and can result in significant reduction of signal (Buxton, 1978; Hoffmann <em>et al.</em>, 2011, Saunders <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Finally, we also describe some of the advantages and disadvantages for each of the methods and tracer combinations (Figure 1). These methods may be used to measure BBB permeability in numerous disease models, transgenic mouse models, and CNS drug delivery evaluations.<br/></p>

Complete cleavage of the 33 kDa epsilon protoxin into the 29 kDa active toxin can also be evaluated via western blot analysis (Linden </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2018).</em> </li></ol></li><li>ETX Induced BBB Permeability<br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>For our experiments, BBB permeability is induced by treating mice with activated ETX at a lethal dose of 5 ng of ETX per gram body weight mouse (5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal (IP) injection. This dose normally induces moribund symptoms in 1-3 h but may be dependent on mouse strain, weight, age, and sex. When female C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old, 18-20 g) are treated with 5 ng of ETX per gram body weight mouse, we see mild symptoms of BBB permeability one-hour post ETX-treatment. Mild symptoms include reduced activity; specifically, mice explore their cage and surroundings less than control treated mice. Symptoms become moribund approximately 3 h after ETX treatment. Moribund symptoms include severe depression/lethargy and occasionally, convulsions. Mice experiencing severe depression/lethargy will not move if gently nudged and only display escape behavior when manually restrained. It should be noted that we have never observed mice recover from mild symptoms using this dose. All mice displaying mild symptoms eventually become moribund. Therefore, symptomatic mice, even those with mild symptoms, need to be carefully observed. We recommend that researches perform preliminary experiments with their own murine population to determine the optimal ETX-treatment time.</em> </li><li><em>For the most consistent and comparable results, we recommend using mice with similar weights, preferably within a 2 g range. ETX dose is based on the weight of the entire animal, so treating animals with similar weights ensures consistent total ETX doses.</em> </li></ol><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Use BSL2 precautions when working with ETX.</li><li>Prepare a 500 ng/ml ETX working solution in sterile saline. Thaw a frozen aliquot of activated ETX at room temperature and dilute 1:674 (337 Î¼g/ml stock solution divided by 500 ng/ml working solution) in sterile saline.</li><li>Immediately prior to treatment, weigh each mouse.</li><li>For ETX treatment, inject mice with 5 ng of ETX per gram body weight diluted in sterile saline via IP injection with a 29-gauge insulin syringe. Briefly, restrain mouse using one hand and grasp excess skin around the nape of the neck with thumb and forefinger and place the tail between the third and fourth finger. Tilt the animal head-down at a 45-degree angle. In the lower right quadrant of the abdomen, insert syringe at a 90-degree angle to the body and administer solution. For more detailed instructions on how to perform an IP injection, refer to previously published methods (Machholz <em>et al.</em>, 2012).<br/>For example, a 20 g mouse would receive a total of 100 ng ETX via injection of 200 Î¼l of a 500 ng/ml ETX solution.<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>20 g mouse multiplied by 5 ng of ETX per gram of mouse = 100 ng total ETX</li><li>100 ng total ETX divided by 500 ng/ml = 200 Î¼l of 500 ng/ml of ETX solution</li></ol></li><li>For control treatment, inject mice with an equivalent amount of sterile saline solution via IP.</li><li>Observe mice for moribund symptoms.

This technique also allows relatively easy evaluation of BBB permeability for the entire brain without transcardial perfusion or tissue sectioning. However, this technique will not identify specific neuroanatomical locations of BBB permeability. This method could be adapted to use other FITC-conjugated tracers as well.</em><br/><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Preparation prior to treatment and tissue harvest<ol class="npwthree"><li>For this experiment, set up analytical balance near animal dissection area with weigh boats conveniently accessible.</li><li>Prepare 15 ml conical tubes containing approximately 10-15 2 mm-glass beads and 1 ml PBS.

FITC-Na solution should be prepared fresh daily and stored in a container protected from light at room temperature.</li><li>Create a FITC-Na standard curve in PBS with the following concentrations: 6 Î¼g/ml, 3 Î¼g/ml, 1.5 Î¼g/ml, 0.75 Î¼g/ml, 0.375 Î¼g/ml, 0.186 Î¼g/ml, and 0.094 Î¼g/ml. Measure and record absorbance for each standard using a spectrophotometer at 490 nm or equivalent.

Briefly, place animal in a cylindrical restraint tube. Warm entire animal or tail to vasodilate blood vessels in the tail. Insert needle in the lateral tail vein near the distal third of the tail. Slowly inject the material. If the needle has been properly inserted into the vein, no resistance should occur as the plunger is depressed and the solution is injected. In addition, the vein should temporarily clear of blood as the solution is injected. For more detailed instructions on how to perform an IV injection, please refer to previously published methods (Gage <em>et al.</em>, 2012).<br/>For example, a 20 g mouse would receive a total of 1.2 mg of FITC-Na via injection of 200 Î¼l of a 6 mg/ml FITC-Na solution.<br/><ol class="npwfour"><li>20 g mouse multiplied by 60 Î¼g of FITC-Na per gram of mouse = 1.2 mg total FITC-Na</li><li>1.2 mg of total FITC-Na divided by 6 mg/ml FITC-Na solution = 200 Î¼l of 6 mg/ml FITC-Na solution</li></ol></li><li>Observe animal for 10 min post FITC-Na administration.</li><li>Euthanize animals with a lethal dose of xylazine and ketamine cocktail (450 mg/kg and 45 mg/kg) via IP injection with 29-gauge insulin needle. Lethal doses of anesthetic agents typically occur at three times the surgical dose. In our hands, death typically occurs 30 min after administration. It is important to note that carbon dioxide administration, as a method of euthanasia, is not appropriate for BBB permeability studies, as carbon dioxide can cause BBB permeability (Clemedson <em>et al.</em>, 1956 and 1958).</li></ol></li><li>FITC-Na measurement<ol class="npwthree"><li>After the mouse has expired (absence of heartbeat), allow the animal to ârestâ for 5 min prior to decapitation to prevent exsanguination.</li><li>Spray mouse liberally with 70% ethanol to wet down fur.</li><li>Decapitate mouse and remove whole brain.

Saline-treated control mice are normalized (divided) to themselves.

FITC-dextran with different molecular weights (4,000, 40,000, and 150,000 kDa) may also be used for this procedure. FITC-Dextran is not fixable by PFA, therefore cardiac perfusion is not recommended with this tracer. In addition, we recommend tissue sections be imaged âdryâ, without the use of fixatives, staining procedures, or mounting media, as use of any aqueous material or solvents may cause leaching of this tracer (Hoffmann </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2011). </em><em>Although this is only a qualitative method for measuring BBB permeability, it works well to identify specific neuroanatomical locations of BBB permeability. In control tissue, 70 kDa FITC-dextran should be confined to vascular lumen, with some extravasation in neuroanatomical areas of known BBB permeability. In brains with dysfunctional BBB activity, large accumulations or âhalosâ of 70 kDa FITC-dextran occur in the brain parenchyma and are considered signs of BBB permeability.</em><br/><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Preparation prior to treatment and tissue harvest:<ol class="npwthree"><li>Prepare a 20 mg/ml 70 kDa FITC-Dextran in sterile saline.

This evaluates extravasation of substances that are 155 kDa or smaller. Animals are perfused with PBS only to remove luminal IgG. Because this method involves freezing of fresh, PBS perfused only tissue, sectioned tissue can be stained using a wide array of immunofluorescent assays (IFA) and IHC applications without the use of antigen retrieval. However, the morphology of sectioned tissue is inferior to tissue that has been perfused with fixative. Because animals are perfused, all luminal IgG will be removed. Therefore, any subsequent IgG signal observed in brain parenchyma or colocalizing with vasculature should be considered a sign of BBB permeability. IgG observed colocalizing with vasculature may indicate BEC internalization of IgG or IgG deposition on vascular walls.</em><br/><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Preparation prior to treatment and tissue harvest<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Prepare pump apparatus and PBS reagent for transcardial perfusion (Gage <em>et al.</em>, 2012).</li><li>Prepare materials for freezing harvested brains by pre-chilling metal plate on dry ice pellets in container for at least 20 min before use.</li><li>If necessary, crush dry ice pellets to create dry ice powder and store in container until use.</li></ol></li><li>Transcardial perfusion and brain harvest<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Treat mice with ETX as described above for the desired amount of time.</li><li>Deeply anesthetize animals with a surgical dose of xylazine and ketamine cocktail (150 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg) via IP injection with 29-gauge insulin needle.

For each treatment condition, we recommend that a minimum of three tissue sections from each animal and three animals per condition be examined. In addition, all control and ETX-treated slides need to be stained simultaneously using the same prepared reagents. As with all microscopic comparisons, ensure that the same microscope (magnification) and imaging settings (exposure, <em>etc</em>.) are used for all comparisons.<br/>For example, in our previously published experiment, we were interested in IgG permeability in pericallosal tissue (Linden <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Images were captured in the myelinated region of the cerebral cortex, superior to the hippocampus and lateral ventricle for all mice, spanning from the corpus callosum to subcortical gray matter.<br/>To measure IgG permeability, capture images on the red (Cy3) channel using a fluorescent microscope.

Use of a pericyte marker can help identify areas of IgG permeability that extend beyond endothelial cells. Alternate antibodies may be substituted for this procedure. When selecting antibodies to use, ensure that the primary antibody is not of mouse origin; we have the most success using rabbit antibodies. We also highly suggest that the secondary antibodies used for this procedure (in our case, FITC conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG) be pre-absorbed to mouse IgG to minimize cross-reaction.</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li>Remove slides from -20 Â°C and allow to warm to room temperature.</li><li>To increase tissue adherence during staining, pre-heat slides at 55 Â°C on a slide warmer for 20 min before staining.

BSA is fixable with 4% PFA, making it an ideal tracer to be used for permeability studies requiring tissue perfusion with 4% PFA/PBS. This technique, in combination with sucrose cryoprotection, results in superior morphology preservation. However, sectioned tissue prepared using this method may require antigen retrieval prior to IFA or IHC applications. Because animals are perfused, all luminal BSA-594 will be removed. Therefore, any subsequent BSA-594 signal observed in brain parenchyma or colocalizing with vasculature should be considered a sign of BBB permeability. Colocalization of BSA-594 with vasculature may indicate BSA-594 internalization by BEC. Permeability to albumin is believed to be a result of increased transcytosis via caveolae-dependent mechanisms (Schnitzer </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 1994; Schubert </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2001; Frank </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2003).
