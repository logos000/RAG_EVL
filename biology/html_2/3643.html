            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In the mammalian visual system, early stages of visual form perception begin with orientation selective neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). In many species (including humans, monkeys, tree shrews, cats, and ferrets), these neurons are organized in pinwheel-like orientation columns. To study the functional organization within orientation pinwheels, it is important to target pinwheel subdomains precisely. We therefore developed a technique to provide a quantitative determination of the location of pinwheel centers (PCs). Previous studies relied solely on blood vessel images of the cortical surface to guide electrode penetrations to PCs in orientation maps. However, considerable spatial error remained using this method. In the present study, we improved the accuracy of targeting PCs by ensuring perpendicularity of electrodes and by utilizing the orientation tuning of local field potentials (LFP) recorded at or near the optically determined positions.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Within the visual cortex, orientation pinwheels (PCs) are singularity centers around which neuronal orientation preference systematically shifts. PCs have been the focus of many studies on how the brain encodes different aspects of object shape, such as linear oriented segments, curved segments, corners, and T junctions (Hubel and Wiesel, 1974; Das and Gilbert, 1999; Hashemi-Nezhad and Lyon, 2012). Single-unit recording has been the most common method for studying organization within orientation pinwheels (Hubel and Wiesel, 1974). However, due to limitations of blood vessel guided localization of microelectrodes and uncertainties of electrode perpendicularity (Nauhaus and Ringach, 2007), it is quite challenging to accurately target microelectrodes to pinwheel centers (PCs). Hashemi-Nezhad and Lyon (2012) used electrodes coated with Dil to nicely demonstrate that electrodes were truly perpendicular; however, the vasculature-based method still contained localization error. Nauhaus and Ringach (2007), carefully matched the electrode locations in a Utah array with locations in an optical imaged orientation map and achieved accurate PC localization, but such an approach offers little control over where the electrodes end up within orientation domains or pinwheel centers. Using 2-photon methods, Ohki <em>et al.</em> (2006) reported that the true PC is only 130 Âµm in diameter, underscoring the need for highly accurate electrode targeting (see also Nauhaus <em>et al.</em>, 2008).<br/><br/>In this study, we developed a method for targeting PCs with high accuracy. This was achieved by: (1) Assuring perpendicular penetrations by imaging a large field of view with a narrow depth of field (~50 Î¼m, front-to-front lens with f1.2 (Ratzlaff and Grinvald, 1991), and then ensuring the electrode paralleled exactly the axis of the optical imaging. Using this procedure, we have estimated that the deviation of electrodes from perpendicular is less than 2 deg (see Figure 3D). (2) Carefully targeting electrodes to PCs based on blood vessel guidance. (3) Further determining the precise PC center by assessing whether the local field potentials (LFP) exhibit ânon-sine-likeâ responses. We have previously shown (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2019) using this methodology that penetrations with sine-like LFP response and small scatter in orientation preference are not true PC locations, while those with non-sine-like response and large scatter in orientation preference (&gt; 60 deg, Maldonado <em>et al.</em>, 1997) are the true PC locations. This additional non-sine-like criterion is essential for highly accurate determination of PC locations and has provided new understanding of orientation subdomain organization (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2019). These detailed procedures are described below.</p>

After surgery, the animal was placed in a stereotaxic frame for performing a craniotomy and conducting neurophysiological procedures. During recording, maintain anesthesia (urethane 20 mg/kg/h), paralysis (gallamine triethiodide 10 mg/kg/h), and blood sugar and fluids (glucose 200 mg/kg/h in Ringerâs solution 3 ml/kg/h i.v.).

Crude positioning of the camera was enabled using a homemade camera arm to which a micromanipulator with 100 millimeter of freedom (manually adjust x, y, z position). Fine positioning of the camera was achieved by electrically adjusting the x, y, z position (10 millimeter freedom) and the declination angle Î± (45 degree freedom) with a micromanipulator platform. The optical instrument is a 14-bit video camera (Andor Technology, Northern Ireland) equipped with two front-to-front connected 50 mm Nikon lenses.</li><li>Illluminate the cortical surface as evenly as possible using green light (546 nm) illumination. Obtain a reference image of the blood vessel pattern (see Figure 2A).</li><li>Focus the camera ~400 Î¼m below the surface of the cortex and collect optical images using red light illumination (605 nm, a wavelength optimal for hemodynamic oximetry signals).</li><li>Obtain orientation preference maps. The intrinsic signals were recorded in response to binocularly viewed full-screen, high-contrast (100%) sinewave gratings. The main set of stimuli included drifting gratings, presented at 8 equally spaced orientations, in both directions (16 conditions). Each stimulus was presented 20 times for 9 s followed by an inter stimulus interval of 16 s. The visual stimuli were generated by a Cambridge Systems VSG graphics board. Stimuli were presented on a high-resolution monitor screen (40 Ã 30 cm) at a 100 Hz vertical refresh rate. The screen background was maintained at the identical mean luminance as the stimulus patches (10 cd/m<sup>2</sup>). The monitor was placed 57cm from the animalâs eyes.</li><li>Generate colored-coded orientation preference maps (Figure 2B) via pixel-by-pixel vector summation of the 8 orientations (Bonhoeffer and Grinvald, 1991). In some experiments, drifting gratings were presented at 16 equally spaced orientations (at 11.25Â° intervals).</li><li>Carefully choose only highly accurate and reproducible maps. That is, first generate maps from different subsets of trials. Then select only maps in which there is no displacement (shifted by no more than 13-26 Î¼m) of pinwheel centers. These are deemed acceptable (MariÃ±o <em>et al.</em>, 2005).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="126" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603030204_9296.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

Only well-isolated cells satisfying the strict criteria for single-unit recordings (fixed shape of the action potential and the absence of spikes during the absolute refractory period) are selected and saved for further analyses.</li></ol></li><li>Single unit functional characterization<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>All cells recorded were located in the area of the cortex representing the central 10Â° of the visual field. When the single-cell action potentials were isolated, the preferred orientation, SF, and TF of each cell were determined. Each cell was stimulated monocularly through the dominant eye, with the no dominant eye occluded. To locate the center of the CRF, a narrow rectangular sine wave grating patch (0.5Â° to 1.0Â° wide, 3.0Â° to 5.0Â° long, 100% contrast) was moved at successive positions along axes perpendicular or parallel to the optimal orientation of the cell, and the response to its drift was measured.<br/></li><li>The grating was set at the optimal orientation and SF and drifted in the preferred direction at the optimal speed for the recorded cells. The peak of the response profiles for both axes was defined as the center of the CRF. We determined the size of the CRF by performing an occlusion test, in which a mask consisting of a circular blank patch and centered on the CRF was gradually increased in size on a background drifting grating (Song and Li, 2008).</li></ol></li><li>LFP recording<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Obtain the orientation tuning of LFP signals.<br/></li><li>Present visual stimuli for LFP recordings (10Â° sine wave grating at 50% contrast), and pseudorandom sequences of gratings of varying orientation and spatial phase, each flashed for 32 ms.<br/></li><li>To analyze stimulus-evoked LFP responses, filter the recordings between 3 Hz and 100 Hz, and compute z scores by averaging responses across trials (for more detail, please see Figure 1 in Katzner <em>et al.</em> [2009]).<br/><br/></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Procedure for Determining Pinwheel Centers Accurately<br/>The following 3 steps ensure high accuracy of targeting PCs. (1) Identifying preliminary PC locations based on blood vessel maps. (2) Ensuring perpendicularity of electrodes. And (3) Selecting sites based on ânon-sine-likeâ LFPs.<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Preliminarily identify pinwheel centers based on surface blood vessel pattern aligned to the orientation map (see Figures 2A and 2B).</li><li>Make electrode penetrations perpendicular to the cortical surface. To ensure that the electrode penetration is perpendicular to the cortical surface, extra effort must be expended (Figures 3A-3C). First, to ensure the cameraâs angle is exactly perpendicular to the plane of the cortex, image a large field of view (<em>e.g.</em>, 1 cm) with a narrow depth of field (~50 Î¼m, front-to-front lens with f1.2 [Ratzlaff and Grinvald, 1991]). We then obtain Î± value of the declination angle (<strong>Î±</strong>, shown in Figure 3D). Adjusted the declination angle of clamping device (clamp electrode) in Narishige stereotaxic instrument (whose mechanical accuracy is about 10 Âµm), made it equaling to <strong>Î±</strong> value, to ensure the electrode parallels exactly the axis of optical imaging. Using this procedure, we have estimated that the deviation of electrodes from perpendicular is less than 2 deg (shown in Figure 3D).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="76" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603030225_8744.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 3. Illustration of electrode deviation from perpendicular.</strong> A. The yellow dots are the positions of 10 penetrations. Orange frame is the ROI (region of interest) in B. B. With the fine-tipped electrodes, there is a very little cortical deformation when the electrode is inserted. Scale bars in (A) and (B): 500 Î¼m. C. We designed a lens (105-mm) with a close-up tube producing a working distance of 17 centimeters, which allows enough distance to make electrode penetrations obtaining images. D. The electrode was kept parallel to the optical axis by aligning the electrode at exactly the same angle as the CCD camera holder. The angle between the optical axis and the line perpendicular to the cortex (<em>ÎÎ±</em>) is <em>ÎÎ±</em> =actan (<em>field_depth</em>/<em>field_length</em>). As our depth of field is about 50 Î¼m and the field of view is several millimeters, then we estimate ÎÎ± is less than 2 deg.<br/><br/></li><li>Selecting sites based on ânon-sine-likeâ LFPs<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Make a penetration at or near presumed PC within the superficial layers (depth &lt; 600 Î¼m) and record the LFP orientation tuning curve and fit with sinewave function. Then calculate the non-sine-like index (NSI) of this sinewave. See Data analysis. Repeat this for several penetrations within the very local region (about 200-500 Î¼m diameter area around the preliminary PC) until a non-sine-like LFP curve is obtained (NSI &gt; 0.10). <em>Explanation</em>: Based on our recent work (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2019), we demonstrated that <em>true PCs</em> have ânon-sine likeâ LFPs (NSI &gt; 0.1), while locations away from PCs exhibit âsine-likeâ LFPs (Li <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Figures 4A and 4B shows a âfalseâ PC site. The recorded LFP orientation tuning curve (4A) is sine-like (NSI = 0) and several single unit recordings in this penetration (4B) have low orientation scatter (MOS = 18Â°). Figures 4C and 4D shows a âtrueâ PC site. The recorded LFP orientation tuning curve (4C) is nonâsine-like (NSI = 0.34) and several single unit recordings (4D) have high orientation scatter (MOS = 65Â°), a consistent marker of PCs (Maldonado <em>et al.</em>, 1997). Across 26 sites, we showed there is a strong positive relationship between NSI and MOS (shown in the Figure 1F in reference [Li <em>et al.</em>, 2019]; when the NSI &gt; 0.1, the MOS &gt; 60Â°). Thus an LFP of NSI &gt; 0.1 provides precise localization of the pinwheel center.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="123" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200603/20200603030243_1442.jpg" width="300"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.
