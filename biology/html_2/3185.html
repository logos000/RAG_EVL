            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Skin cells are constantly exposed to environmental influences such as air pollution, chemicals, pathogens and UV radiation. UV radiation can damage different biological structures, but most importantly cellular DNA. Mitochondria contain their own genome and accumulate UV-induced DNA mutations to a large extent. This can result, <em>e.g.</em>, in accelerated skin aging. Understanding the impact of harmful external influences on mitochondrial function is therefore essential for a better view on the development of age-related diseases. Previous studies have been carried out on cell cultures derived from primary cells, which does not fully represent the real situation in the skin, while the mitochondrial parameters were considered barely or not at all. Here we describe a method to measure mitochondrial respiratory parameters in epithelial tissue derived from human skin biopsies using an Agilent Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyzer. Before the assay, epidermis and dermis are separated enzymatically, we then used the XF24 Islet capture microplates to position the epidermis samples to measure oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR). In these plates, small nets can be fixed to the plate bottom. The epidermis was placed with the vitalâbasalâside on the net. Active ingredients in the three ports were injected consecutively to determine the effect of each compound. This allows determining the efficiency of the individual complexes within the respiratory chain. This protocol enables the testing of toxic substances and their influence on the mitochondrial respiration parameters in human epithelial tissue.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The human skin is the largest organ of the human body and functions as a physical barrier shielding the body from a number of harmful external agents such as air pollution or solar radiation (Gebhard <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Solar radiation, <em>e.g.</em>, induces increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby DNA damage and mutations in skin, which results in skin aging and skin cancer (Gebhard <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from DNA damage is thought to play an important role in these and other essential cellular processes. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-damaged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and proteins can induce mitochondrial dysfunction within the electron transport chain (ETC) and in turn lead to an enhanced ROS production and increased mitochondrial dysfunction (Furda <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Yoshida <em>et al.</em>, 2012). According to the âmitochondrial theory of agingâ, this vicious cycle is a major cause for cellular aging, tissue dysfunction and degeneration (Harman, 1972). Understanding the impact of harmful external influences on mitochondrial function is therefore essential for a better view on aging in general. Unfortunately, the measurement of mitochondrial respiration in cell cultures cannot completely reflect the real situation in skin. We therefore established an efficient method to measure the mitochondrial respiration <em>ex vivo</em> directly in human epidermis biopsies with the Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyzer and Seahorse XF24 Islet Capture microplates. The XF24 Analyzer is a multi-well plate system which measures oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) by changes in the fluorescence of solid state fluorophores. In this system, up to four different ports can be used to inject compounds to obtain a mitochondrial respiration profile. The procedure described in this protocol includes the preparation of the biopsies, the preparation of the epidermis for insertion into the XF24 Analyzer and the measurement of mitochondrial parameters by the addition of specific mitochondrial inhibitors. This protocol was established for the testing of toxic substances and their influence on the mitochondrial respiration parameters in human epithelial tissue. In addition, age-related effects of various substances can be tested based on the age of the donor. The analysis of mitochondrial respiration in epidermis derived from skin biopsies represents an important addition to existing screenings.</p>

The indicated concentrations may differ for other biopsies. In preliminary studies, the concentration of 4 Î¼M was determined.

Samples from body regions with a high UV exposure (<em>e.g.</em>, eyelids) show a significantly lower mitochondrial respiration on average than samples with a low UV exposure (<em>e.g.</em>, abdomen) from donors with the same age.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27139">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>10 M NaOH <br/>40 g NaOH <br/><em>ad</em> 100 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O</li><li>1x PBS<br/>8 g NaCl<br/>0.20 g KCl<br/>2.88 g Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>Â·12H<sub>2</sub>O<br/>1.24 g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><br/><em>ad</em> 1 L ddH<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.4</li><li>Enzymatic digestion solution<br/>8 ml KBM<sup>TM</sup> Gold Keratinocyte Growth Medium BulletKit<sup>TM</sup><br/>4 ml Dispase II<br/>Final concentration 2.4 U/ml</li><li>XF assay medium<br/>0.675 g Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagleâs Medium-high glucose <br/><em>ad</em> 50 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O, sterile filtering, pH 7.4 <br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27140">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">The authors thank Dr. Hug, Dr. Huth, Dr. Astfalk and Dr. Then-Schlagau for the kind supply of samples.
