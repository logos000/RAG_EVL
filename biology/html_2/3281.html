            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Although axons in the peripheral nervous system can regenerate, functional recovery after nerve injuries is poor. Activity-based therapies, such as exercise and electrical stimulation, enhance the regeneration of cut peripheral axons. Despite their effectiveness, clinical application of these experimental techniques has been limited. At least part of the basis for this translational barrier has been a lack of information as to the precise mechanism of activity-based therapies on peripheral axon regeneration. To evaluate the requirements for neuron-type specific activation to promote regeneration using these therapies, in the current protocol, we employed optogenetics. Utilizing the advantages of transgenic mouse lines we targeted opsin expression to different neuron types. Using fiber optics we activated those neurons with high temporal specificity as a model of activity-based intervention after nerve injury and to measure functional recovery achieved after such a treatment.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Optogenetics has emerged as a potent tool in experimental neuroscience. The expression of light-gated ion channels in neurons can be used to control neuronal activity with great temporal precision, and by targeting of that expression to different neuronal populations the role of that activity can be studied very specifically. Our lab and others have demonstrated that activity-based experimental therapies, such as exercise and electrical stimulation, if applied after peripheral nerve injury will enhance the regeneration of cut axons of motor and sensory neurons (Al-Majed <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Brushart <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Wood <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Thompson <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Exercise in the form of treadmill running is a powerful promoter of axon regeneration but it is difficult to separate the effects of exercise-induced activation of injured neurons from other effects, such as alterations in available hormones, changes in muscle properties, modulation of immune cells or activation of uninjured neurons in networks that generate the locomotion. Furthermore, when modeling the effects of exercise on recovery from peripheral nerve injury, it is difficult to determine whether the effect is due to the production of action potentials in the neurons whose axons have been severed or whether exercise may alter the membrane potential of axotomized neurons without directly causing it to fire an action potential. To determine these parameters would be highly challenging in an awake behaving animal running on a treadmill.<br/><br/>Brief electrical stimulation of a cut peripheral nerve also enhances axon regeneration (Elzinga <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Gordon and English, 2016). It offers some technical advantages in probing the mechanism of action of exercise on peripheral axon regeneration. A specific peripheral nerve can be unilaterally targeted by applying stimulation to the nerve, and the frequency and duration of stimuli (action potentials) applied to the nerve can be controlled. However, other cell types within a peripheral nerve also respond to electrical stimulation (Schwann cells and probably immune cells), and the conductive nature of tissues can facilitate current spread. The lack of cell-type specificity of electrical stimulation and exercise also have limited some of the mechanistic questions that can be proposed. Here, we describe a way to use optogenetics to apply a cell-type specific activity-based therapy and also to use optogenetics to provide a functional outcome measure (direct muscle response, <em>i.e.</em>, the direct M response) following nerve injury.<br/><br/>We used mouse genetics to target the expression of the light-sensitive cation channel, channelrhodopsin 2, selectively in sensory neurons, motoneurons, or both. In the mice we used,   only a subset of the neurons with axons in peripheral nerves expressed this opsin, those that also express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP); other neurons acted as internal controls. We then activated the opsin-expressing neurons by application of light to their axons in peripheral nerves. We found that brief optogenetic activation enhanced peripheral axon regeneration regardless of whether motor or sensory neurons were treated individually or synchronously (Figure 1). We also used optogenetics to measure functional recovery using electrophysiology (Ward <em>et al.</em>, 2016).<br/><br/>A major advantage of the use of optogenetics in this model system is that activity can be discretely controlled in genetically targeted neuronal populations of interest. Optogenetics can be used to evaluate the mechanism behind the success of activity-based therapies on peripheral axon regeneration. For example, we have also used an inhibitory opsin, <em>Natromonas</em> halorhodopsin, fused to a light-emitting <em>Renilla</em> luciferase and Venus (a protein for bioluminescent resonance energy transfer that amplifies the emitted light) (Tung <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Berglund <em>et al.</em>, 2016) to inhibit neuronal activity during treadmill exercise. The luciferase oxidizes a small molecule substrate, h-Coelenterazine, to generate yellow photons and activate the halorhodopsin. Thus, after administration of h-Coelenterazine, neurons expressing this iLMO2 fusion protein become hyperpolarized. In motoneurons whose axons were regenerating, we found that inhibiting motoneuron activity during treadmill exercise blocked the enhancing effect of exercise (Jaiswal <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Considered together, the results of these optogenetic experiments lead us to conclude that neuronal activity is both necessary and sufficient to promote the regeneration of injured peripheral axons.<br/><br/>Future advances in excitatory and inhibitory opsins, bioluminescence, luminopsins and chemogenetics will continue to facilitate the development of neuromodulation and novel gene therapy approaches. Via chemogenetic manipulation using DREADDs (Cre-dependent excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs), we have shown that subthreshold excitation of motoneurons and sensory neurons is sufficient to enhance their regeneration (Jaiswal <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The application of these new optogenetic tools will expand our ability to further define the activity requirements of highly specific neuronal populations.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="129" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617033407_3914.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. graphical representation of the mouse model and sciatic nerve.</strong> Multiple promoters can be used to selectively express ChR2 (or other opsins) in targeted cell types. In the cartoons of spinal cords and dorsal root ganglia cross-sections, different cell types express ChR2 and are responsive to blue light activation in the periphery. The whole sciatic nerve and its terminal branches are depicted in the cartoon. Using different transgenic mouse models, we have shown that excitatory neuronal stimulation and exercise enhance axon regeneration following sciatic nerve injury, and this effect can be blocked with inhibitory luminopsins.</p>

The non-absorbable skin sutures should be removed from the skin ~7-10 days.

By comparing EMG response amplitudes in the same latency windows over a range of stimulus intensities (optical or electrical), a full motor recruitment curve can be generated (Figure 5B) and the stimulus threshold for activation and maximal evoked responses can be determined. If a change in neuronal excitability is expected, such as when using an inhibitory opsin (Jaiswal <em>et al.</em>, 2018), such an effect can be evaluated as changes in stimulus threshold. Using recording electrodes placed on the nerve, optical nerve stimulation can be used to collect an evoked electroneurogram (Ward et al., 2018) and similar quantitative measurements can be made. When optically stimulating sensory axons in a nerve, the resulting ENG measurements (Figure 5A, right) also can be used to partition the responses of sensory axons of different sizes and conduction velocities by evaluating response amplitudes in different latency windows. Finally, if electrically- and optically-evoked data are collected in the same experiment, the maximal responses can be expressed as an optical/electrical ratio (Ward <em>et al.</em>, 2016) and analyzed at different recovery times in comparison to data from intact controls (Figure 5C).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="132" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190617/20190617044808_3062.jpg" width="100"/><br/><strong>Figure 5. Examples of ways in which quantitative electrophysiological data were analyzed.</strong> A. Rectified EMG (left) or ENG (right) traces yield several quantifiable parameters, including latency (time from stimulus onset to response, bold double arrow), duration (time from the detectable response the dashed lines), and response amplitude (mV). After the injury, latencies and amplitudes decrease, while duration increases. B. Ramp of slowly increasing stimulus intensity (voltage if electrical stimulation; luminance [mW/mm<sup>2</sup>] if optically stimulating) allows the detection of threshold (the stimulus intensity required to evoke a response 50% of the time) and the maximum response. C. Collection of electrical and optical data within the same experiment (left) facilitates the distinction of evoked responses due to electrically excitable (wild type and ChR2 expressing) neurons/axons vs. responses due optically excitable (ChR2 expressing) neurons/axons. Electrically- and optically- evoked M responses can be expressed as a ratio (bar graph-right) to determine the proportion of wild type and ChR2-expressing that have successfully regenerated at different times after injury. In the bar graph, we show that 4 weeks after injury, the maximal M response appears due to the successful regeneration of ChR2 expressing motoneurons that had undergone optical treatment versus the intact and untreated groups.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28200">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>It should be noted that optical fibers can crack if mishandled or bent and could lead to reduced light output due to scattering. The amount of reduction may not be noticeable with oneâs eyes. Thus, we recommend that the fiber optic cables be periodically tested for light output by using a photodiode power sensor (available at ThorLabs) suitable for the wavelength of light being utilized. </li><li>Latencies are sometimes used in humans to inform clinicians about type of axons (<em>e.g.</em>, C fiber versus AÎ´) they are recording from. However, in the mouse, the available distances between the recording and stimulating sites are very small and do not lend themselves well to such analyses.</li><li>More optical tools and optogenetic mice will become available. With the three genotypes of mice, we have tested with channelrhodopsin, the duration of the light pulse required to evoke a response varied. Therefore, we strongly suggest that a range of light pulse durations be tested before applying as a treatment or to produce optical data as an outcome measure.</li><li>In the majority of Chat-ChR2-YFP mice, the observed M response produced by optical stimulation dissipated or disappeared completely during optical treatment at 20 Hz. The activation of the channelrhodopsin simply could not follow this rate of light application (Ward <em>et al.</em>, 2018). At slower optical stimulation rates (<em>e.g.</em>, 10 Hz) M responses could be evoked reliably. In these animals, light stimulation was applied at 10 HZ but for two hours. Others have shown that the absolute number of stimuli, not the rate of stimulation, is the most critical parameter for enhancing peripheral axon regeneration (Park <em>et al.</em>, 2015).</li><li>We initially attempted these experiments with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) constructed inside the tubing (similar to Michoud <em>et al.</em>, 2018). It is critical to insulate the solder points and frequently test them for electrical leaks.
