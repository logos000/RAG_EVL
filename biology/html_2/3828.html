            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Sweet basil (<em>Ocimum basilicum</em>) is a popular herb with high economic value and is currently threatened by a severe oomycete disease. An efficient transformation method is a prerequisite for gene functional analysis to accelerate molecular breeding and deploy effective disease management strategies, and breeding through genetic engineering. Here we present a detailed protocol for a highly efficient <em>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em>-mediated transformation method for sweet basil, which was established based on a previously reported method by other researchers, with modifications on several aspects, including growth of sweet basil, age of plants used for explants, preparation and concentration of <em>Agrobacteria</em>. This protocol allows researchers in academia and agroindustry to generate transgenic sweet basil plants in an easy, quick and highly reproducible manner. In addition, this protocol may be applicable to transform other species within the genus <em>Ocimum</em>.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>Sweet basil (<em>Ocimum basilicum</em>) is a popular herb, holding high economic value for its significant medicinal, culinary and cosmetic properties. Its global production is hampered by severe downy mildew disease caused by the oomycete pathogen <em>Peronospora belbahrii</em>. Traditional breeding involving interspecific hybridization in sweet basil has been a hassle with F1 sterility and difficulty in segregating out undesirable traits. On the other hand, genetic engineering of sweet basil offers a platform to study molecular biology, broaden sources of desirable traits and accelerate breeding process. A highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing system for targeted mutagenesis of <em>ObDMR1</em> gene was established for sweet basil using <em>Agrobacterium</em>-mediated stable transformation (Navet and Tian, 2020). Two independent constructs were used for transformation to express gene-editing reagents. With <em>NPTII</em> gene as the selectable marker, we obtained 34 and 48 kanamycin-resistant regenerated plants from 176 and 238 explants, yielding a transformation efficiency of 19.3% and 20.2% respectively. All kanamycin-resistant plants were tested positive for transgene integration. The transformation method we described (Navet and Tian, 2020) differs from the previous <em>Agrobacterium</em>-mediated transformation of sweet basil established by Deschamps and Simon (2002), which utilized the regeneration protocol by Phippen and Simon (2000), in certain aspects: mainly, growth of sweet basil, age of plants selected for explants, preparation of <em>Agrobacteria</em>, and <em>Agrobacterium</em> concentration used to infect explants. We established the protocol using sweet basil cultivar Genoveser. To shorten and simplify the process we used leaf discs from small young leaves (contrary to fully expanded leaves) as explants and a simple method to prepare <em>Agrobacteria</em>. Our lab has been successful in transforming sweet basil with diverse plant binary vectors following this method. Here we provide a detailed protocol for this convenient and reliable transformation method through which transgenic sweet basil plants with stable inheritance of the transgene can be quickly generated. This protocol is expected to enable researchers in academia and agroindustry to meet their needs in basil functional genomics and breeding for desirable traits.</p></p>

sweet basil seeds in square pots filled with Sunshine Mix 4 and allow it to grow for 3 weeks in a plant growth chamber at 25 Â°C with a photoperiod of 12 h.</p></li><li><p>Plants used for

prior to transformation, streak <em>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</em> EHA105 carrying the desired plasmid, which is stored at -80 Â°C, on a LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotics. We used the plasmids derived from pKSE401 vector (Xing <em>et al.</em>, 2014) for targeted mutagenesis of sweet basil <em>ObDMR1</em> using CRISPR/Cas9 (Navet and Tian, 2020). The LB agar plates in our experiments are supplemented with 15 Î¼g/ml rifampicin (for selection of <em>A. tumefaciens</em> EHA105) and 50 Î¼g/ml kanamycin (for selection of the plasmid). Incubate the plate at 28 Â°C for two days.<br/><em>Note: This plate can be stored at 4 Â°C and used within one week.</em> </p></li><li><p>The day before transformation, scoop bacteria from the above plate using the bottom of a sterile 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube and spread on a new LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotics (containing kanamycin and rifampicin in our study). Incubate the plate overnight at 28 Â°C.</p></li><li><p>On the day of transformation, scrape a portion of bacterial cells with a sterile 1 ml pipette tip and resuspend in 1 ml <em>Agrobacterium</em> Inoculation media (IN) by pipetting the solution up and down until a homogeneous suspension is observed. Transfer the suspension to a 15 ml tube containing 5 ml IN media, and mix well.</p><p><em>Note: Cover this tube with aluminium foil to avoid light as IN media contains light-sensitive acetosyringone.</em> </p></li><li><p>Measure the OD<sub>600</sub> of the above bacterial suspension using a spectrophotometer with IN media as blank, and adjust the final OD<sub>600 </sub>to ~0.6, a concentration used for inoculating explants. Approximately 20 ml of <em>Agrobacterium</em> suspension is needed for 100-150 explants. Incubate the suspension in a sterile 50 ml conical tube at room temperature (RT) on an orbital shaker at 70 rpm for 2 h in dark.</p><p><em>Note: Loosen the lid of the 50 ml conical tube to allow aeration and then cover the tube with aluminium foil.</em> </p></li></ol></li><br/><li><p>Preparation of explants</p><p><em>Note: Perform Steps C2, C3 and C4 in sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood.</em> </p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>Prepare the explants while the incubation of <em>Agrobacterium</em> suspension is taking place. From three-week-old sweet basil plants pluck the first pair of true leaves, and surface sterilize the leaves for 5 min by immersing them in 12% (v/v) Clorox Regular Bleach Disinfectant solution in a 500 ml media bottle. This step should be done gently to avoid leaf damage. For each transformation, we usually handle ~100 leaves.</p></li><li><p>Immediately after surface sterilization, wash the leaves in sterile MilliQ water for 3 min by gently inverting the bottle several times. Repeat this washing step three more times. A total of four washes are required to remove any trace of bleach sticking to the leaves.</p></li><li><p>Transfer the leaves onto a sterile paper towel. Excise two round leaf discs from each leaf from regions close to leaf base along the midrib using a sterile #2 cork borer, as shown in Figure 1.</p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3828/bioprotoc-10-22-3828-g001.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

Seal the plates with Micropore<sup>TM</sup> surgical tape tape, wrap with aluminium foil and incubate the plates at 25 Â°C under dark conditions for 4-6 weeks with regular sub-culturing onto fresh media every two weeks.</p><p>  During this process, we observe several key regeneration stages, including: swelling-up of leaf discs in irregular fashion within 1 week (Figure 4B), callus formation in another 1-2 weeks (Figure 4C), followed by the sprouting of tiny shoots usually as pale/yellow-colored (since plates are incubated under dark conditions) (Figure 4D) and occasionally green-colored (Figure 4E). A regular check on plates every week is recommended to observe callus/shoot formation. Do not allow the calli/shoots to turn dark (brown/black) and sub-culture onto fresh media if and when required. While sub-culturing clean the calli/shoots by removing any dead/decaying (brown/black) tissues and then place on fresh media.</p><p><em>Note: Shoots may emerge inside the media as well, so flip the side when performing fresh sub-culturing to allow proper aeration.</em> </p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3828/bioprotoc-10-22-3828-g004.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 4.

Seal the containers with Micropore<sup>TM</sup> surgical tape, cover with aluminium foil and incubate the containers for 1 week in dark at 25 Â°C.<br/><em>Note: Do not overcrowd the container with young shoots; allow half-centimeter spacing while placing the shoots.</em> </p></li><li><p>After 1 week, remove the foil and incubate the containers under light with a 12-hour photoperiod at 25 Â°C for 4-8 weeks with regular sub-culturing every two weeks onto fresh RI media supplemented with timentin and kanamycin. During sub-culturing to fresh media, make sure to remove any dead or decaying tissue, and only transfer the well-differentiated green shoot stalks (Figure 5B). Transfer each well-differentiated shoot stalk separately into a tissue culture container to allow root establishment and full development of the transgenic plant (Figures 5C-5D). It usually takes 2-3 weeks after providing light conditions for a shoot stalk to develop into a transgenic plant with robust roots. At this stage (Figures 5C-5D), leaf tissue can be excised from the plants growing in the container to test for transgene integration by PCR.</p><p><em>Notes:</em> </p><ol class="npwthree"><li><p><em>Keep a close observation on containers and perform sub-culturing when required;</em> </p></li><li><p><em>Discard shoots that do not show signs of root formation within one month.</em> </p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3828/bioprotoc-10-22-3828-g005.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.
