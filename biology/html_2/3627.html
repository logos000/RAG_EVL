            <h1>Pancreatic Acinar Cell Preparation for Oxygen Consumption and Lactate Production Analysis</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is a principal feature of acute pancreatitis (AP) although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. AP precipitants induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) in pancreatic acinar cells (PACs), leading to ATP depletion and necrosis. Evaluations of mitochondrial bioenergetics have mainly been performed in isolated PACs using confocal microscopy, with assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential, NADH/FAD<sup>+</sup> and ATP levels, coupled with patch-clamp electrophysiology. These studies are technically demanding and time-consuming. Application of Seahorse flux analysis now allows detailed investigations of bioenergetics changes to be performed in cell populations using a multi-well plate-reader format; rates of oxygen consumption (OCR) and extracellular acidification (ECAR) provide important information about cellular respiration and glycolysis, respectively. Parameters such as maximal respiration, ATP-linked capacity and proton leak can be derived from application of a respiratory function âstressâ test that involves pharmacological manipulation of the electron transport chain. The use of Seahorse Flux analysis therefore provides a quick, and convenient means to measure detailed cellular bioenergetics and allows results to be coupled with other plate-reader based assays, providing a fuller understanding of the pathophysiological consequences of mitochondrial bioenergetics alterations.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is a core feature of acute pancreatitis (AP), a debilitating and potentially fatal disease for which there is currently no specific therapy (Criddle, 2016; Habtezion <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The elucidation of pivotal pathological mechanisms which underlie mitochondrial damage in pancreatic acinar cells (PACs) is paramount for the development of new therapies. Previous evaluations of mitochondrial bioenergetics in isolated PACs have been mostly performed using confocal microscopy, including assessments of mitochondrial membrane potential (tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester: TMRM), NADH/FAD<sup>+</sup> autofluorescence and ATP (Magnesium Green), coupled with patch-clamp electrophysiology (Voronina <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Criddle <em>et al.</em>, 2004 and 2006). Such studies have pinpointed a reduction of ATP in response to precipitants of AP, via the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), as a critical event that leads to necrotic cell death (Criddle <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Mukherjee <em>et al.</em>, 2016); supplementation with intracellular ATP ameliorated damage. Furthermore, luciferase measurements in PACs have provided details of changes of both mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP concentrations induced by pathophysiological stimulation (Voronina <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Such experimental approaches in single cells, however, are technically difficult and time-consuming. In contrast, population-based assays provide important information about mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death using a convenient plate-reader format (Armstrong <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The use of Seahorse Flux analysis allows a detailed evaluation of bioenergetics changes to be performed in PACs, measuring rates of oxygen consumption (OCR) and extracellular acidification (ECAR); these inform about cellular respiration and glycolysis, respectively. A respiratory function âstressâ test can further be applied in which pharmacological manipulation of the electron transport chain (ETC) is used to derive parameters such as the Maximal Respiration, Spare Respiratory Capacity, ATP-linked Turnover and Non-mitochondrial Respiration. Such detailed bioenergetics information can be coupled with parallel studies of apoptosis and necrosis to inform the influence of mitochondrial dysfunction on cell death patterns (Armstrong <em>et al.</em>, 2018).</p>
