            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Functional activities of many transmembrane proteins are controlled by their endocytosis. One of the most studied experimental models is the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR). However, endocytic trafficking of EGFR has been predominantly analyzed using labeled EGF, whereas quantitative analyses of the endocytosis of the receptor itself have been sparse. The fluorescence microscopy methods described here are designed to directly quantify EGFR internalization in living cells without labeled EGFR ligands or antibodies. These methods utilize an engineered EGFR chimera in which the fluorogen activating protein (FAP) is fused to the receptor extracellular domain (FAP-EGFR). Binding of malachite green (MG) based dyes to FAP results in a strong far-red fluorescence of MG, thus efficiently labeling FAP-EGFR. In particular, binding of the cell impermeant MG-Bis-SA dye to FAP produces the pH-sensitive dual-excitation fluorescence, which allows differentiation of the cell-surface and internalized pools of FAP-EGFR. Two modifications of the methodology are described: 1) single-cell three-dimensional confocal imaging; and 2) high-throughput assay in multi-well plates. These methodologies can be adopted to study endocytosis of any other transmembrane protein extracellularly tagged with FAP.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Although EGFR internalization has been studied for decades and is often used as a prototypical experimental model to investigate the mechanisms of clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis, our knowledge about these mechanisms is still incomplete. EGFR internalization has been mostly studied by monitoring fluorescently or radiolabeled EGF (Sorkin and Duex, 2010; Pinilla-Macua and Sorkin, 2015). Limited quantitative information is available about EGFR internalization induced by other ligands (that are technically difficult to label) and other stimuli, as well as about constitutive internalization of the receptor. Conventional cell-surface biotinylation and antibody-based methods have been used to monitor EGFR internalization (Burke and Wiley, 1999; Burke <em>et al.</em>, 2001). However, these methods either do not have sufficient sensitivity to detect endocytosis induced by physiological-relevant low ligand concentrations or have other caveats related to antibody bi-valency and selective recognition of different receptor conformations, or do not allow monitoring the time-course of EGFR endocytosis in living single cells.<br/> <br/>Here we describe methods to visualize EGFR endocytosis and measure the rate of EGFR internalization. These methods are based on the expression of the EGFR chimeric protein in which the fluorogen activating protein (FAP) is genetically fused to the receptor amino-terminus (FAP-EGFR). Binding of cell impermeant malachite green fluorogen (MG-B-Tau) to FAP results in a strong far-red fluorescence (excitation at 640 nm; emission at 680-700 nm), which labels the cell-surface FAP-EGFR. Binding of cell impermeant MG-Bis-SA, a pH sensitive Cy3-MG tandem dye, to FAP-EGFR, results in a single far red emission by dual-excitation at 561 nm and 640 nm. In this system, MG fluorescence results from both the direct excitation (640 nm) and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the pH-sensitive Cy3 (excitation at 561 nm), which is minimal at the neutral pH of the extracellular medium but increases several fold at the acidic pH environment of endosomes and lysosomes (pH 6.5-4.5). The ratio of MG fluorescence excited at 561 nm and 640 nm (the â561/640â ratio) is proportional to the ratio of the internalized and total MG-Bis-SA-bound FAP-EGFR and is, therefore, used to determine the extent of FAP-EGFR endocytosis. The principles of the ratiometric assay in cells expressing FAP-tagged receptors are described in detail in our previous studies (Perkins <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Larsen <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/> <br/>Here we describe two experimental protocols that take advantage of the MG: FAP-EGFR system. 1) <strong>A single-cell internalization assay using MG-B-Tau or MG-Bis-SA</strong>: FAP-EGFR endocytosis is monitored on a pixel-by-pixel basis in single living cells by labeling the surface-localized receptor with either MG-B-Tau or pH-sensitive MG-Bis-SA dyes followed by time-lapse three-dimensional (4-D) spinning disk confocal microscopy imaging. Imaging of MG-B-Tau and MG-Bis-SA labeled FAP-EGFR are used to obtain qualitative information about the extent and rate of FAP-EGFR endocytosis. Labeling with MG-B-Tau can be combined with the stimulation of cells with the labeled ligand (<em>e.g.</em>, Rhodamine labeled EGF, EGF-Rh), so that subcellular localization of the ligand and the receptor can be simultaneously monitored. Labeling with MG-Bis-SA is performed to distinguish FAP-EGFR located in endosomes from the cell-surface localized FAP-EGFR. 2) <strong>High-throughput internalization assay in 96-well plates:</strong> FAP-EGFR is labeled with MG-Bis-SA, followed up by automated two-channel 2D imaging to obtain the mean values of the 561/640 ratio for individual wells of the 96-well plate, increases in which correspond to movement of the receptor into acidic endosomes. This method is designed to quantify FAP-EGFR endocytosis under multiple experimental conditions. In particular it is useful for dose-response assays as well as screening siRNA, small-compounds and other libraries.<br/> <br/>These methods require cells expressing extracellularly FAP-tagged EGFR. Although we have developed these assays using HeLa cells, in which endogenous EGFR was fused to FAP using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, the same methods are applicable to cells transiently or stably expressing recombinant FAP-EGFR. However, we believe that the endogenous FAP-EGFR system offers the highest sensitivity and ensures the physiological relevance. Technical information provided in the parental paper (Larsen <em>et al.</em>, 2019) should facilitate gene-editing of endogenous EGFR in other cell lines of interest. Furthermore, the same approach can be used to study endocytosis of a multitude of other transmembrane proteins.</p>

To avoid labeling of this EGFR pool by MG dyes during time-course experiments, replace MG dye containing medium with the fresh 37 Â°C prewarmed starvation media prior to cell stimulation or other treatments. To confirm that medium change does not induce FAP-EGFR internalization, perform imaging for 15 min at 37 Â°C in untreated cells.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti30711">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Buffer solutions with pH 4.8-8.1<ol class="npwthree"><li>Prepare one common solution (for 1 L):<br/><em>Note: To cover the whole pH range, use two different buffers (MES for acidic and HEPES for alkaline part of the range) while Keeping the ion composition.</em><br/>140 mM NaCl (8.18 g)<br/>5 mM KCl (0.37 g)<br/>1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (0.20 g of MgCl<sub>2</sub>Â·6H<sub>2</sub>O)<br/>1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0.15 g of CaCl<sub>2</sub>Â·2H<sub>2</sub>O)</li><li>Split into two (for 0.5 L)</li><li>For pH &lt; 6.8: 50 mM MES (4.88 g)<br/>Take 7 aliquots of 50 ml.
