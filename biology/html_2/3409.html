            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Reagents such as Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> Red have been developed for detecting hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and are used to measure the release of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from biological samples such as mammalian leukocytes undergoing the oxidative burst. <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> is commonly used as a model host in the study of interactions with microbial pathogens and releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a component of its defense response. We adapted the Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit to measure H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> output from live <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> exposed to microbial pathogens. The assay differs from other forms of ROS detection in the worm, like dihydrofluorescein dyes and genetically encoded probes such as HyPer, in that it generally detects released, extracellular ROS rather than intracellular ROS, though the distinction between the two is blurred by the fact that certain species of ROS, including H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, can cross membranes. The protocol involves feeding <em>C. elegans</em> on a lawn of the pathogen of interest for a period of time. The animals are then rinsed off the plates in buffer and washed to remove any microbes on their cuticle. Finally, the animals in buffer are distributed into 96-well plates and Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> Red and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) are added. Any H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> released into the buffer by the worms will react with the Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> Red reagent in a 1:1 ratio in the presence of HRP to produce the red fluorescent excitation product resorufin that can be measured fluorometrically or spectrophotometrically, and the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> released can be calculated by comparison to a standard curve. The assay is most appropriate for studies focused on released ROS, and its advantages include ease of use, the ability to use small numbers of animals in a plate reader assay in which measurements can be taken either fluorometrically or spectrophotometrically.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Interest in developing assays to study the amount and type of reactive oxygen species produced by <em>C. elegans</em> was primarily driven by the use of this model organism in studies focused on aging and infection. Oxidative damage caused by ROS has long been hypothesized to contribute to aging, and therefore measuring the intracellular oxidative environment and how it changes over time and in various aging mutants is relevant. Likewise, ROS are generated during the <em>C. elegans</em> immune response where they are capable of acting as signaling or effector molecules. Understanding the sources of ROS and being able to measure their magnitude is therefore of key importance (reviewed by [Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013; McCallum and Garsin, 2016; Miranda-Vizuete and Veal, 2017]). Commonly used methods to measure ROS in <em>C. elegans</em> include dihydrofluorescein dyes, the genetically encoded HyPer probe, and the Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> Red assay. Additional methods with more specific applications include MioSox, a modified dihydroethidium (DHE) that is specific for measuring ROS in the mitochondria, and the Grx1-roGFP2 genetically-encoded probe that measures changes in redox potential (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013). All current methodologies that measure ROS have caveats that must be carefully considered when deciding what method to use and how to interpret the results. <br/><br/>The dihydrofluorescein dyes, including 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA) commonly used in <em>C. elegans</em>, are colorless and membrane permeable in the reduced form, but become fluorescent and non-membrane permeable when oxidized. Therefore, these dyes can penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane and provide a decent measure of intracellular ROS (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013). However, to measure the fluorescence from <em>C. elegans</em> using a plate reader, a large number of animals (1,000) are required (Schulz <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Ewald <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Alternatively, animals can be visualized using fluorescence microscopy (Sem and Rhen, 2012). Two disadvantages to H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA include the fact that it is not specific to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and it may exert free radical properties, contributing to the generation of ROS in addition to its measurement (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013; Dikalov and Harrison, 2014). <br/><br/>HyPer, in contrast, is considered very specific to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It consists of a cpYFP (circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein) inserted into the regulatory domain of OxyR-RD and placed under the control of a<em>C. elegans</em> promoter. Both tissue-specific promoters and non-specific promoters have been utilized in the worm depending on the application (Back <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Knoefler <em>et al.</em>, 2012). The sensor works based on the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond that occurs upon interaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The strength of the two fluorescent emission peaks released by HyPer changes upon formation of the disulfide bond; one decreases and the other increases in a proportionate manner (Belousov <em>et al.</em>, 2006). The advantage of such a ratiometric approach is that quantification can be done independently of the expression levels of the protein and therefore no normalization is required (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013). An additional advantage is the ability to monitor hydrogen peroxide levels over time and observe both increases and decreases. Disadvantages include the fact that HyPer is sensitive to pH changes and overexpression of these probes can significantly affect H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> redox signaling of the cell potentially confounding results. Furthermore, measuring the emission peaks requires sophisticated microscopy of individual animals or large numbers of animals (1,000/sample) to obtain accurate results from a plate reader (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013; Dikalov and Harrison, 2014; Ewald <em>et al.</em>, 2017).<br/><br/>The Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> Red assay is based on the oxidation of 10-acetyl-3,7- dihydroxypenoxazine, which is catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to produce a red fluorescent oxidation product, resorufin, at a 1:1 ratio (Figure 1). Resorufin can be measured both fluorometrically and spectrophotometrically, though the fluorescent measurements are more sensitive and can detect lower levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Mohanty <em>et al.</em>, 1997). The Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit was first adapted to <em>C. elegans</em> by our group to measure the output of ROS following exposure to microbial pathogens (Chavez <em>et al.</em>, 2007; Chavez <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Tiller and Garsin, 2014; van der Hoeven, <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The assay measures the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> excreted by the worm into the surrounding medium. The major source of ROS during this response appears to be an NADPH oxidase called BLI-3, which is found in the hypodermis (skin), intestine and pharynx (Edens <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Chavez<em>et al.</em>, 2007 and 2019; van der Hoeven <em>et al.</em>, 2015). BLI-3 is a member of the dual oxidase (DUOX) family of proteins, which all feature a peroxidase domain in addition to an NADPH oxidase domain that generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> rather than superoxide (Aguirre and Lambeth, 2010). Bioinformatic predictions and experimental evidence indicate that BLI-3 is located in the cytoplasmic membranes of the tissue in which it is produced and oriented in a manner such that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> will be excreted into extracellular environments (Edens <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Chavez <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Aguirre and Lambeth, 2010; Moribe <em>et al.</em>, 2012; van der Hoeven <em>et al.</em>, 2015). Based on the localization of BLI-3, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is released from the hypodermal surface and into the lumen of the GI tract whereupon it is excreted due to the defecation cycle that the animals continuously undergo. When measuring H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from animals exposed to pathogen, the levels can be significantly, but not completely, suppressed by the addition of an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (Chavez <em>et al.</em>, 2007 and 2009). These results suggest that there are additional sources of ROS during infection that are contributing the pool of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that is being measured. A likely source is the mitochondria, which are known to become dysfunctional during pathogen assault (Pellegrino <em>et al.</em>, 2014), and ROS generated from this source in the form of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> would be able to cross membranes and contribute to the extracellular pools. Advantages to using the Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> Red assay for measuring ROS in the worm include the fact that it is specific to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, it can be done on samples containing as few as 30 worms in a plate reader, and it does not require sophisticated genetics or microscopy (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013; Tiller and Garsin, 2014). Disadvantages include the fact that there is no tissue specificity and one must be careful to maintain samples in the dark, as resorurfin is light sensitive (Labuschagne and Brenkman, 2013). Herein, we present a detailed protocol of our adaption of the Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit to measuring H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> output from the worm following pathogen exposure. </p>

Cut the end of a pipette tip to make the opening larger and, looking under the stereomicroscope, suck up about 15 worms in 25 Î¼l of reaction buffer and transfer to a well of a 96-well plate. Do this twice to obtain 30 +/- 2 worms per 50 Î¼l of reaction buffer/well. Count animals and adjust if necessary.

Desired final concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> standards will be achieved after adding the same volume of Amplex<sup>Â®</sup> red reagent mix.
