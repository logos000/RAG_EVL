            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Our understanding of the regulation and functions of cell-surface proteins has progressed rapidly with the advent of advanced optical imaging techniques. In particular, single-molecule tracking (SMT) using bright fluorophores conjugated to antibodies and wide-field microscopy methods such as total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy have become valuable tools to discern how endogenous proteins control cell biology. Yet, some technical challenges remain; in SMT, these revolve around the characteristics of the labeling reagent. A good reagent should have neutrality (in terms of not affecting the target proteinâs functions), tagging specificity, and a bright fluorescence signal. In addition, a long shelf-life is desirable due to the time and monetary costs associated with reagent preparation. Semiconductor-based quantum dots (Qdots) or Janelia Fluor (JF) dyes are bright and photostable, and are thus excellent candidates for SMT tagging. Neutral, high-affinity antibodies can selectively bind to target proteins. However, the bivalency of antibodies can cause simultaneous binding to two proteins, and this bridging effect can alter protein functions and behaviors. Bivalency can be avoided using monovalent Fab fragments generated by enzymatic digestion of neutral antibodies. However, conjugation of a Fab with a dye using the chemical cross-linking agent SMCC (succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) requires reduction of the interchain disulfide bond within the Fab fragment, which can decrease the structural stability of the Fab and weaken its antigen-binding capability. To overcome this problem, we perform limited reduction of F(abâ)2 to generate Fabâ fragments using a weak reducer, cysteamine, which yields free sulfhydryl groups in the hinge region, while the interchain disulfide bond in Fabâ is intact. Here, we describe a method that generates Fabâ with high yield from two isoforms of IgG and conjugates the Fabâ fragments with Qdots. This conjugation scheme can be applied easily to other types of dyes with similar chemical characteristics.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Cell-surface protein functions are tightly regulated in their native environment. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of their functions necessitates monitoring their interactions with various cell membrane components, such as other proteins and lipids, and cytoskeletal machinery and cellular organelles below the membranes. Optical tools enabling live-cell based imaging at a molecular level (Joo <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Lord <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Chung, 2017) include conventional methods such as confocal microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) combined with specific modalities such as FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Sekar and Periasamy, 2003), single-molecule tracking (SMT) (Moerner, 2012), and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (Kim <em>et al.</em>, 2007), and cutting-edge super-resolution microscopy, such as photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) (Betzig <em>et al.</em>, 2006), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) (Rust <em>et al.</em>, 2006), stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy (Hein <em>et al.</em>, 2008), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (Gustafsson, 2000 and Gustafsson <em>et al.</em>, 2009), and lattice light sheet (LLS) microscopy (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Using these tools for live-cell imaging to monitor endogenous proteins requires bright fluorophore-coupled reagents that specifically bind to target proteins. To this end, bright dyes such as semiconductor quantum dots (Qdots) (Dahan <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Chung and Bawendi, 2004; Lidke <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Chung <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Bien-Ly <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Chung and Mellman, 2015; Chung <em>et al.</em>, 2016) and Janelia Fluor (JF) dyes (Grimm <em>et al.</em>, 2015 and 2017) conjugated to high-affinity and non-perturbing antibody-based reagents are widely used. However, an antibody can bind to two target proteins simultaneously. This problem is typically circumvented by digesting antibodies to Fab fragments using proteolytic enzymes such as papain, which cleaves at the hinge region of immunoglobulins (Chung <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Bien-Ly <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Chung and Mellman, 2015; Chung <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Conjugation of Fab with fluorescent dyes relies on a thiol-maleimide reaction. This reaction, however, can destabilize Fab when the interchain disulfide bond within a Fab is reduced, which elicits loss of binding capability to target proteins within a relatively short period of time (a few weeks at best). Consequently, laboratories must frequently regenerate the conjugates, imposing higher cost and hours lost. Thus, we use Fabâ fragments containing free sulfhydryl groups in the hinge region (Selis <em>et al.</em>, 2016), which can be used for a succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC)-based conjugation reaction without reducing the interchain disulfide bond within Fabâ. To this end, we perform two-step reactions, in which IgG is digested into F(abâ)2 by pepsin and Fabâ is generated by limited reduction of F(abâ)2 using cysteamine. In this protocol, we showcase a method that generates Fabâ fragments from two different types of antibodies and subsequently conjugates one type of Fabâ with quantum dots (Qdots) to monitor EGFR on live cells using SMT. We believe this conjugation scheme will most likely improve the overall yield and stability of the tagging reagents for various types of live-cell imaging of endogenous proteins.</p>

SDS-PAGE analyses of the pepsin digestion (A) and cysteamine reduction (B) of Î±EGFR rat IgG2a.

Zeba Spin Desalting Columns, PBS, and NAb Protein A Plus Spin Columns used in this protocol can be found in this kit.</li><li>Pepsin solution should be prepared freshly for each reaction.</li><li>Pepsin will be irreversibly denatured in higher pH buffer. Never prepare the pepsin solution in neutral buffer.</li><li>When using concentrated IgG samples, simply dilute the samples to desired concentration in acetate digestion buffer and skip Procedure B.</li><li>Pepsin digestion varies for different IgG molecules. A time course (1-5 and 16 h) test using small aliquots of desired IgG before the preparation of F(abâ)2 is recommended. If the digestion time is set to be 16 h as proposed in Procedure C, start this reaction at the end of a day and stop the reaction the next morning.</li><li>The purpose of changing the acetate buffer to PBS after the pepsin digestion is to terminate the reaction and to prepare the sample for Protein A purification (for removal of undigested IgG) since the Protein A column is ineffective at acidic pH.</li><li>Protein A column can be regenerated by following the manufacturerâs instructions using IgG elution buffer (pH 2.8).</li><li>The digestion/reduction products can be verified using non-reducing SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as shown in Figures 2, 5, and 9, as necessary.</li><li>This conjugation scheme can be applied directly to a maleimide linked dye, where active maleimide can react with sulfhydryl groups within the Fabâ. </li><li>Cysteamine is sensitive to air and moisture. Store the original bottle in a vacuum desiccator. Prepare cysteamine solution right before use.</li><li>The reduction yield by cysteamine may vary depending on different F(abâ)2 samples. A pilot test on a range of pH (5, 6, and 7), temperature (4 Â°C, 10 Â°C, 22 Â°C, and 37 Â°C), and cysteamine concentration (0.5-20 mM) is highly recommended.</li><li>HPLC or FPLC can be used to further purify the reduced sample for Fabâ. </li><li>The incubation time and concentration of the conjugates can vary depending on experiments, affinity of the Fabâ, <em>etc.</em>, We typically vary these in the ranges of 2-10 min (incubation time) and 0.5 to 10 nM (conjugate concentration).<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29377">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Acetate digestion buffer, pH 4.0<br/>0.1 M acetate buffer<br/>0.01 M EDTA</li><li>Exchange buffer, pH 7.2<br/>50 mM HEPES<br/>150 mM NaCl<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti29378">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">We thank the members of the Chung Laboratory for useful discussion and Jore Kotryna Vismante for photographing the procedure.
