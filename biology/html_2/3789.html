            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>SARS-CoV-2 has quickly spread all around the globe causing illness and wide damages. Most countries were unprepared for such a rapid spread and crisis. This led to various strategies for effective control of the new pandemic. A key aspect in all countries was to effectively test the population for the virus. Most countries chose a lockdown strategy in which many workplaces and activities are completely closed, leading to substantial economy costs. Here, we present a protocol we recently developed that allows rapid and simple detection of SARS-CoV-2 for the large population, eliminating costs and involvement of professional teams and laboratories. This protocol is based on Reverse Transcribed Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP). We tested this protocol directly on patient samples, both nasal and throat clinical swabs as well as saliva. Notably, this protocol is simple, cheap and can be easily applied to other pathogens as well.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is affecting large populations, and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).<br/><br/>Mass surveillance of the population and quarantine proved to be effective strategies in dealing with this crisis. The main key for detection is the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test. While this test is effective, it requires professional experience both in sampling and in performing the test. Furthermore, the reagents and lab equipment are expensive (Bruce <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Altogether, these created a bottleneck for mass scale testing.<br/><br/>Fortunately, to date, alternative molecular biology methods can overcome such limitations. One of these methods is colorimetric Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) (Notomi<em> et al.</em>, 2000). LAMP is performed at a single and constant temperature (<em>i.e.,</em> isothermal), and allows a one-step reverse transcription. Its results can be visualized by color change with the naked eye. This method is cheap and requires little to no lab equipment (Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Yu <em>et al.</em>, 2020; Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2020). It can be widely used in points of care such as the workplace and schools, which can increase the number of tested subjects tremendously. We see this method as a surveillance tool to markedly increase the total number of tests per day and identify patients for further tests in hospital settings.<br/><br/>Here we present a protocol for applying one step reverse transcribed LAMP (RT-LAMP) detection method on clinical samples from nasal, throat swabs and from saliva. The primers we used were previously designed by Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2020 on synthetic and purified RNA (Table 1). The protocol we present (Ben-Assa<sup>*</sup>, Naddaf<sup>*</sup> <em>et al.</em>, 2020), while with these same primers, does not require RNA purification steps and can be conducted directly on clinical samples. This protocol requires no professional experience and results can be obtained within an hour. The results of this protocol were compared to the approved RNA purification and quantification RT-qPCR method at the Rambam Health Care Campus (RHCC) hospital. The downside of this method is its detection sensitivity, which is considerably lower than the standard RT-qPCR method (Ben-Assa<sup>*</sup>, Naddaf<sup>*</sup> <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Therefore, it is applicable for a large-scale surveillance tool rather than a replacement of the current gold-standard detection method. While this protocol was validated on SARS-CoV-2, it can be adjusted to other pathogens too (bacteria or viruses).</p>
