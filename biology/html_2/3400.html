            <h1>Immunohistochemical Identification of Muscle Fiber Types in Mice <em>Tibialis Anterior</em> Sections</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Vanitha V. Rao, Abhishek Mohanty</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Mammalian skeletal muscle is a metabolically active tissue that is made up of different types of muscle fibers. These myofibers are made up of important contractile proteins that provide force during contraction of the muscle like actin and myosin. Murine myofibers have been classified into 4 types: Type I, Type IIa, Type IIb and Type IIX. Each muscle fiber has been identified with specific type of MyHC expressed, which in turn gives differential contractility to the muscle.<br/><br/>There have been well-known methodologies to identify different myofibers: histochemical myosin ATPase staining which uses the differential ATPase activity between slow and fast fibers, quantification of metabolic enzymes like malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase on specific fragments of muscle fibers. The drawback of these techniques is that they cannot differentiate the subtypes of myofibers, for example, Type IIa and Type IIb. They should be used in conjunction with other known histochemical staining techniques. Here, we devise a direct and robust immunohistochemical staining methodology that utilizes the differential expression of MyHC isoforms in different myofibers types, thus efficiently distinguishing the heterogeneity of the muscle fibers. We use antibodies that specifically recognize Type I, Type IIa and Type IIb fibers on serially cut frozen mouse <em>tibialis anterior</em> sections that can be quantified by ImageJ software.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Skeletal muscle is a highly organized tissue composed of several distinct compartments of muscle fibers. Each muscle fiber is a multinucleated single cell, enclosed by sarcolemma, and is predominantly made up of myofibrils (Seeley <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Muscle fibers that have low contraction speed are called slow twitch or type I fibers. Slow twitch fibers have high mitochondrial density and express myosin isoform Myh7 (Lompre <em>et al.</em>, 1984; Talmadge and Roy, 1993). Type II fibers are divided into type IIa and type IIb fibers. Both of these fibers have high contraction speed, thus generating greater force compared to type I fibers. Type IIa fibers have moderately high contraction speed and are anaerobic in nature. Type IIa fibers also have high density of mitochondria with increased oxidative potential. Type IIa fibers predominantly contain myosin isoform Myh2 in mammals. Type IIb fibers have very high contraction speed and are anaerobic in nature. Type IIb fibers have low mitochondrial density and predominantly contain myosin isoform Myh4. Muscle fibers that are neither Type IIa nor Type IIb fibers are called Type IIx or Type IId, and have high expression in the diaphragm and hence is omitted from this study (Schiaffino and Reggiani, 1994; Westerblad <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Mouse <em>tibialis anterior</em>, a hind limb skeletal muscle made of Type I, Type IIa and Type IIb myofibers serves as a suitable muscle to study the robustness of the immunohistochemical staining procedure.<br/><br/>Other methodologies to distinguish the different muscle fiber types are myosin ATPase histochemical staining of frozen muscle sections pre-incubated in alkaline pH showing light staining for Type I fibers and dark staining for Type II fibers. Muscle sections pre-incubated in acidic pH showed dark ATPase staining for Type I fibers, light staining for Type IIa muscle fibers and intermediate staining for Type IIb fibers (Brooke and Kaiser, 1970, Guth and Samaha 1970). Quantitative estimation of mitochondrial enzymes like glycerophosphate oxidase (GP-OX) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) have been used to distinguish Type IIa and Type IIb fibers in mouse and rabbit <em>tibialis anterior</em> muscle but gave variable ratios of enzyme activities in mice and rabbit muscles (Reichmann and Pette, 1984). There have been quantification methodologies of specific metabolic enzymes like lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase on frozen serial sections of muscles (Hintz <em>et al.</em>, 1984). However, these protocols are extensive and may give non-specific signals. The protocol detailed here uses specific antibodies that recognize different Myosin Heavy chain isoforms on serially cut frozen <em>tibialis anterior</em> mid-belly region sections that is readily detected with a suitable secondary antibody. After image acquisition, the number of each fiber type is quantified using ImageJ software. </p>
