            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Lipid membranes are involved in regulating biochemical and biological processes and in modulating the selective permeability of cells, organelles, and vesicles. Membrane composition, charge, curvature, and fluidity all have concerted effects on cellular signaling and homeostasis. The ability to prepare artificial lipid assemblies that mimic biological membranes has enabled investigators to obtain considerable insight into biomolecule-membrane interactions. Lipid nanoscale assemblies can vary greatly in size and composition and can consist of a single lipid monolayer, a bilayer, or other more complex assemblies. This structural diversity makes liposomes suitable for a wide variety of biochemical and clinical applications. Here, we describe a calcein dye leakage assay that we have developed to monitor phospholipid vesicle disruption by alpha-synuclein (Î±Syn), a presynaptic protein that plays a central role in Parkinsonâs disease (PD). We present data showing the effect of adenylylation of Î±Syn on Î±Syn-mediated vesicle disruption as an example. This assay can be used to study the effect of mutations or post-translational modifications on Î±Syn-membrane interactions, to identify protein binding partners or chemical entities that perturb these interactions, and to study the effects of different lipids on the permeabilization activity of Î±Syn or any other protein.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Liposomes are nanoscale lipid assemblies formed as a result of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions among lipid head groups and fatty acid side chains, respectively. These biological membrane-mimicking lipid bilayer assemblies are a useful tool for studying membrane interactions of protein biomolecules due to (i) the flexibility of modulating the diameter of the liposomes, and thus the membrane curvature; and (ii) control over the lipid composition (Ahmed <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Siontorou <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Due to their bilamellar structure, liposomes contain an intralumenal aqueous cavity within which water-soluble reagents can be encapsulated (Duzgunes <em>et al.</em>, 2010). This property has been exploited in drug delivery approaches (Alavi <em>et al.</em>, 2017) and in studies of membrane permeabilization (Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2013) and vesicle fusion (Duzgunes <em>et al.</em>, 2010) involving the encapsulation of fluorescent, hydrophilic (membrane-impermeable) markers.<br/> <br/>Alpha-Synuclein (Î±Syn) is a presynaptic protein that interacts with negatively charged cellular membranes as part of its biological function (Pineda and Burre, 2017). Î±Syn interactions with membranes are also known to induce aggregation of the protein on the membrane surface (Ysselstein <em>et al.</em>, 2015).This process is hypothesized to lead to a disruption of membrane integrity as a result of lipid extraction during the growth of Î±Syn aggregates on the bilayer (Ysselstein <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Reynolds <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Evidence suggests that membrane-induced Î±Syn aggregation coupled with vesicle disruption contributes to Î±Syn neurotoxicity in PD (Ysselstein <em>et al.</em>, 2017).<br/> <br/>Î±Syn-mediated vesicle permeabilization has been modeled using different biophysical methods, including assays designed to monitor the leakage of dyes from synthetic liposomes (Reynolds <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Iyer <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The water-soluble fluorophore calcein is well suited for dye leakage assays because it undergoes self-quenching at high concentrations in the lumenal space of synthetic vesicles, but shows a dramatic increase in fluorescence emission upon dilution in the extra-liposomal buffer following membrane disruption (Figure 1). We and other labs have used a calcein leakage assay to characterize the vesicle permeabilization activity of wild-type (WT) Î±Syn and mutant or post-translationally modified forms of the protein (Sanyal <em>et al.</em>, 2019), as well as to assess the effect of an Î±Syn-interacting protein on vesicle disruption (Ysselstein <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Here, we describe the calcein leakage assay and present data obtained using this method showing the effect of adenylylation on Î±Syn-mediated vesicle disruption.</p>

Consult the chloroform safety data sheet for information about proper PPE, keeping in mind that chloroform is an eye, skin, and respiratory irritant and has been classified as a potential/probable human carcinogen.</em><br/><br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Rinse one 25/50 ml round-bottom flask (for each liposome preparation) sequentially with the following: soap water, deionized H<sub>2</sub>O, acetone, and chloroform. Discard chloroform waste in a proper container. Oven dry the flask for 1-2 h or dry at 25 Â°C overnight.<br/><em>Note: Use a strong glass cleaning solution if the flask looks dirty.</em><br/></li><li>Mix phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids in a 1:1 molar ratio so that the final (total) concentration of lipid is 5-10 mg/ml (or in a different molar ratio as needed). Lipids are obtained as a chloroform solution or a powder and should be stored as aliquots in a -20 Â°C freezer (200 Âµl of a 25 mg/ml stock solution of egg PG or egg PC in each vial). ALWAYS store chloroform-lipid solutions in chloroform-compatible glass vials).</li><li>Remove any residual lipids from the glass vial by rinsing with chloroform; transfer the rinse to the round-bottom flask.<br/><em>Note: The exact amount of chloroform used to rinse is not important, as the chloroform will be removed by evaporation in subsequent steps.</em> </li><li>Use a stream of nitrogen or argon gas to evaporate the chloroform in the flask while swirling continuously to make a thin lipid film.<br/><em>Note: Failure to continuously swirl the flask will result in an uneven distribution of lipids on the interior wall of the flask.</em> </li><li>After the chloroform is evaporated, transfer the flask to a desiccator for 1 h minimum.</li><li>To prepare calcein-encapsulated vesicles (dye concentration, 103 mM), add 70 mg of calcein to 865 Âµl deionized H<sub>2</sub>O + 135 Âµl 2 N NaOH in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Vortex the solution until all of the calcein is dissolved. Add the resulting ~1 ml calcein solution to the round-bottom flask with the dried lipids.<br/><em>Note: If calcein is not dissolved, then 2 N NaOH can be added dropwise (vortexing in between drops) until complete dissolution is achieved. The solution volume can be scaled down as needed to increase the liposome concentration. The osmolality must be kept identical (i.e., ~280 mOsm/kg) for both the intra- and extra-liposomal solutions at all stages and can be monitored using a standard micro-osmometer.</em> </li><li>Swirl the flask for 30 s every 5 min over a period of 1 h to ensure that all lipids from the interior wall of the flask fall into the solution.<br/><em>Note: The lipid suspension should be kept above the phase transition temperature of the lipid mixture (determined based on the guidelines of the supplier, in this case Avanti) during liposome preparation. A temperature of 25 Â°C is acceptable for 1:1 (mol/mol) PG:PC. During this step, the chromatography column can be prepared (see Step D1).</em><br/><div style="white-space:nowrap;"><br/></div></li></ol></li><li>Extruder assembly<ol class="npwtwo"><li>Submerge 4 filter supports and 1 polycarbonate membrane into a small beaker of deionized H<sub>2</sub>O.</li><li>Place the 2 internal membrane supports (Figure 2) on a flat surface with the O-rings facing up.</li><li>Place 2 soaked filter supports over the teflon orifice.

Allow the resin to settle, and continue adding beads until the bed reaches a height of 7 cm. Proper column height is crucial for optimal separation and flow rate. Tap the column to remove any bubbles and to allow the beads to settle. Place a filter on top of the beads. Store at 4 Â°C until ready for use. Columns may be stored in 20% (v/v) ethanol (or 0.02% (w/v) NaN<sub>3</sub> for short periods) and reused.<br/><em>Note: Before use, rinse the column with several column volumes (CV) of deionized H</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em>O prior to exchanging to the desired mobile phase.

Calcein within liposomes should be a lighter shade of orange/yellow, whereas free calcein should be red.<br/><em>Note: The loading volume will depend on the columnâs loading and separation capacity. After first applying the sample to the column, wait for the solution to enter the bed completely. Then, add the same volume of mobile phase, and let it fully enter as well. Next, apply a larger volume of mobile phase, and proceed with the separation until all visible bands have eluted from the column.</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200715/20200715005904_6277.jpg" width="113"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.
