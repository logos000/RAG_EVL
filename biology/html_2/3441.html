            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Given the endemic seroprevalence of herpes simplex viruses (HSV), its associated human diseases, and the emergence of acyclovir-resistant strains, there is a continuous need for better antiviral therapies. Towards this aim, identifying mechanistic details of how HSV-1 manipulates infected cells, how it modulates the immune responses, and how it causes diseases are essential. Measuring titers and growth kinetics of clinical isolates and viral mutants are important for a thorough characterization of viral phenotypes <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>. We provide protocols for the preparation as well as titration of HSV-1 stocks, and explain how to perform single-step growth curves to characterize the functions of viral proteins or host factors during infection. In particular, we describe methods to prepare and characterize high-titer HSV-1 stocks with low genome to titer ratios that are required for infection studies in cell culture and animal experiments.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the prototypic genus of the human pathogenic subfamily <em>Alphaherpesvirinae</em>. Worldwide, it has a seroprevalence of approximately 67% that varies from 30% to more than 90% in different human groups, depending on the age, the socio-economic status, and the geographical region (Nahmias <em>et al.</em>, 1990; reviewed in Smith and Robinson, 2002; Looker <em>et al.</em>, 2015). HSV-1 shares several features with all herpesviruses: (i) a conserved virion architecture, (ii) productive and lytic infection of cells and (iii) establishment of life-long-latent infection in the host (Whitley and Griffiths, 2002; Schleiss, 2009).<br/><br/>During acute infection, HSV-1 causes cutaneous and mucosal herpetic lesions, and in very young or immune-compromised individuals more severe sequelae, such as potentially blinding keratitis and life-threatening disseminated disease or encephalitis (Thompson and Whitley, 2011; Kennedy and Steiner, 2013). Despite a potent antiviral immune response inside the host, the immune system fails to clear the virus. This is achieved by HSV-1-mediated immune evasion mechanisms (Theodoridis <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Su <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Zheng, 2018; Tognarelli <em>et al.</em>, 2019), and the establishment of life-long latent infection in neurons of peripheral ganglia which are reached via retrograde axonal transport (Smith, 2012; Roizman and Whitley, 2013; Koyuncu <em>et al.</em>, 2018). During latency, viral antigen expression in the neurons is restricted, but the virus sporadically reactivates upon lowered immune surveillance and systemic stress (Padgett <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Huang <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Recurrent productive infections after reactivation comprise anterograde axonal spread, virus release from the neurons back to mucocutaneous sites, and reinfection of epithelial cells (Enquist <em>et al.</em>, 1998; Whitley and Roizman, 2001; Diefenbach <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Smith, 2012; Koyuncu <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>Here, we describe protocols to prepare HSV-1 stocks. We generate virus stocks by harvesting post-nuclear supernatants from repeatedly freeze-thawed infected cells, or by pelleting cell-free virions released from infected cells into the conditioned medium. For cell entry and animal experiments, we recommend purifying such preparations further on sedimentation density gradients (Sathananthan <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Sodeik <em>et al.</em>, 1997; DÃ¶hner <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Dai and Zhou, 2014).<br/><br/>Viral stocks will maintain and acquire genomic mutations, if they provide an evolutionary advantage and are not deleterious during virus amplification. To achieve a high genomic homogeneity, a passage 1 preparation from a single viral plaque or a single clone generated by mutagenesis should be generated. Subsequent passage numbers should be kept to a minimum (Harland and Brown, 1998). We characterize virus stocks by measuring the number of plaque-forming units (pfu) by plaque-titration (see Procedure B) and the number of viral genomes by real-time detection PCR (DÃ¶hner <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Engelmann <em>et al.</em>, 2008). In addition, the particle to pfu ratio can be determined by electron microscopy (Harland and Brown, 1998; DÃ¶hner <em>et al.</em>, 2006). To this end, virus stocks are mixed with latex beads of known concentration and appropriate heavy metal salts for negative contrast, and analyzed by electron microscopy. Viral particles and latex beads are counted, and using the known concentration of the latex beads as a reference, the number of viral particles can be determined. Low ratios of genome to pfu, total protein to pfu, or particle to pfu are indicative of a high-quality virus stock.<br/><br/>Since HSV-1 causes strong cytopathic effects, we use plaque assays to determine the number of infectious units within a given sample. Due to the high HSV-1 prevalence, it suffices to add a pooled fraction of human IgGs to the cell culture medium to prevent virus spread via the culture medium. Alternatively, an overlay with agarose or methylcellulose could also neutralize extracellular HSV-1 virions; however, such assays require a bit advanced experimental skills. The direct cell-to-cell spread of HSV-1 leads to the formation of macroscopic plaques, which indicates the occurrence of an infectious particle present in this sample. <br/><br/>Titration of virus stocks is not only crucial for subsequent <em>in vitro</em> or <em>in vivo</em> infection experiments, <em>i.e.</em>, to use a defined amount of plaque forming units (pfu), but also during the analysis of viral loads in different tissues of infected animals, when comparing phenotypes of different viral mutants, or during the characterization of clinical isolates. Moreover, the impact of perturbing a host function by pharmacological inhibitors, gene silencing, genetic knock-out, or overexpression is determined by performing a time course of virus production. <br/><br/>The growth kinetics of viral mutants lacking essential protein functions are compared in non-complementing versus complementing cells, the latter expressing the ablated protein in <em>trans</em> (Schipke <em>et al.</em>, 2012; SandbaumhÃ¼ter <em>et al.</em>, 2013). When analyzing the impact of particular host factors on virus propagation, viral yields on deficient cells obtained by RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9 technology or from knock-out animals are compared to yields on the corresponding wildtype cells (DÃ¶hner <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>Single-step or multi-step growth curves in susceptible cell lines provide a standardized method to compare different clinical isolates or viral mutants with the respective wildtype strain, or to determine the impact of a particular host factor during infection. In single-step growth curves, a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 to 20 pfu/cell ensures complete and simultaneous infection. We recommend monitoring virus propagation up to 24 hpi during one replication cycle (Harland and Brown, 1998). In contrast, multi-step growth curves amplify the effect of more subtle phenotypes during several cycles of replication (Harland and Brown, 1998). Thus, cells are infected using a low MOI of 0.01 to 0.1 pfu/cell for 3 days. While both methods involve the same procedures, we focus here on the experimental setup for a synchronous single-step infection.</p>

For virus propagation, we recommend using BHK-21 cells, although several other permissive cell lines such as Vero or HeLa cells can be used as well. HSV-1 mutants lacking the expression of essential proteins are propagated on appropriate complementing cell lines.<br/>  Use a passage 1 virus isolate, clone or mutant to generate a medium-scale passage 2 virus stock that provides the inoculum for a large-scale preparation of passage 3 to 4 for infection experiments. To produce virus stocks, cells should be infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). This fosters amplification and packaging of complete viral genomes, and prevents an enrichment of viral particles harboring defective genomes (Harland and Brown, 1998).<br/><ol class="npwtwo"><li>Three days prior to inoculation, seed BHK-21 cells into five cell culture flasks (T<sub>175</sub>) in 30 ml cell culture medium (10% FCS; Recipe 1) for confluency two days after (= one day prior to infection).</li><li>One day prior to inoculation, split BHK-21 cells approximately 1:3 into 16 cell culture flasks (T<sub>175</sub>) in 30 ml of fresh cell culture medium (10% FCS) to achieve approximately 90 to 95% confluence on the next day. Alternatively, seed cells at lower cell density (1:10 to 1:20) three days prior to inoculation to achieve approximately 90 to 95% confluence on the day of inoculation. However, to facilitate achieving an appropriate cell density, we recommend seeding cells at higher density one day prior to inoculation.<br/><em>Note: Use 15 cell culture flasks for virus inoculation and one cell culture flask for determining the cell density to calculate the amount of the HSV-1 inoculum. The latter flask can be used for further cell culture.</em><br/><ol class="npwthree" style="font-size:13.3333px;color:#666666;white-space:normal;"><li>One day prior to inoculation, aspirate the cell culture medium and wash cells with 10 ml PBS/cell culture flask.</li><li>Aspirate PBS, immediately add 3 ml of trypsin/EDTA, ensure complete distribution on the cell layer and incubate at 37 Â°C for 3-4 min.</li><li>Meanwhile, prepare 16 T<sub>175</sub> cell culture flasks each containing 27 ml pre-warmed cell culture medium.</li><li>Microscopically verify trypsinization of the cells.

If seeded at low density, some cell lines tend to grow to small confluent cell islets. Cells in the periphery of such islets are more susceptible to HSV-1 infection than confluent cells in a monolayer, since the major HSV-1 receptor nectin-1 is sequestered into cell-cell adhesion contacts and not accessible for virus binding (Schelhaas </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2003; Marozin </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2004; Snijder </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2012).</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191204/20191204042549_2145.jpg" width="133"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

Both media warrant a stable pH during subsequent inoculation of the cells outside a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.<br/><em>Note: As CO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em> is a gas, it evaporates quickly from the medium outside a CO</em><sub><em>2</em></sub><em> incubator, which will therefore turn more basic.

In our hands, the time point of harvesting is crucial and can vary from three to four dpi. For good yields of high-quality HSV-1 extracellular virions, harvest the cell culture supernatants when 80 to 90% of the cells display cytopathic effects, i.e., cells are rounded up and detach from the bottom of the flask. When harvesting HSV-1 too early, the yields for extracellular virus will be lower. When harvesting HSV-1 too late, the virus stocks will be of lower quality due to cell debris. In particular, released DNA/RNA will crosslink many viral particles and thus hampers sufficient resuspension of aggregated virions (see Step A4d).</em><br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191204/20191204042649_1618.jpg" width="195"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.

HSV-1 virions can be purified using sucrose, Ficoll, nycodenz or iodixanol (Opti-prep) gradients (Sathananthan <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Sodeik <em>et al.</em>, 1997; DÃ¶hner <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Marconi and Manservigi, 2014). At the same density, Ficoll, nycodenz and iodixanol solutions have a lower osmotic pressure than sucrose solutions. When HSV-1 virions enter a sucrose sedimentation gradient, they lose water due to an increasing osmotic pressure at higher sucrose concentration, and more importantly swell abruptly upon dilution from their sucrose fraction into MNT or PBS buffers. Such changes in osmotic pressure impair the physical integrity of enveloped virions. Therefore, we developed protocols using nycodenz for gradient purification of HSV-1 stocks (DÃ¶hner <em>et al.</em>, 2006).<ol class="npwthree"><li>Prepare a linear nycodenz gradient.

Handling of virus preparations needs to be performed in a biosafety L2/S2 cabinet, while wearing gloves and goggles. We avoid the use of needles, syringes, or any other sharp devices to prepare high-titer virus stock solutions. All waste that contains or has encountered infectious virus needs to be inactivated either chemically (bleach or aldehyde-containing disinfections), or by autoclaving for at least 20 min at 121Â°C, according to the biosafety L2/S2 regulation in the respective country and the L2/S2 guidelines of the respective institution.
