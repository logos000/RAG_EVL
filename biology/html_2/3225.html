            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Heterogeneous prostatic carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) contribute to tumor progression. This was established using transgenic mouse models. Paracrine interactions between fibroblasts and epithelial cells were further interrogated using isolated 2D cell culture systems, but 3D culture systems currently being developed can better mimic reciprocal interactions potentially found in the native tissue. To understand paracrine and juxtacrine signaling among fibroblasts and epithelia, 3D co-cultures with species differences allows for further subsequent analysis of the cultures. The use of mouse and human cells, for example, in one system allows for species-specific FACS or quantitative PCR analysis. This protocol describes the use of a 3D Co-culture System of Mouse Prostatic Wild-type Fibroblasts with Human Prostate Cancer Epithelial Cells.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Prostate cancer (PCa) is a heterogeneous disease that results in the second highest cancer mortality in men. From the early steps of PCa initiation, the associated stromal fibroblastic cells begin to co-evolve with cancer progression and are predictive of recurrent disease and survival (Ayala <em>et al.</em>, 2003). Studying paracrine signaling from the epithelial cancer cells to the associated fibroblasts and vice versa is imperative to understand the complex interactions during all stages of cancer progression (Bhowmick <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Placencio <em>et al.</em>, 2008). 2D culture systems where conditioned media from one cell type is incubated with the target cell type as well as those utilizing Boyden chamber cultures enable the exchange of paracrine factors. However, the characteristics of the cells in collagen matrix have documented differences in their responses to hormones and growth factors (Ziaee and Chung, 2014; Naba <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Utilizing a 3D co-culture system allows a more representative readout of paracrine interactions between the stroma and epithelia. This system can be adapted for multiple combinations of stromal fibroblasts and cancer epithelial cells. Combinations of mouse and human cells can be used to better differentiate the cell type from which the signals were derived/received. Furthermore, incubation in a hypoxic chamber can more closely model physiologic environments. We have used localized prostate cancer as an example for our studies.</p>

Sub-confluence is recommended as actively proliferating cells are best. Cells will be trypsinized and resuspended in either 1x complete RPMI or DME/F12 media. <br/><em>Note: It is best to use cells that are actively proliferating and not confluent.</em> </li><li>Count cells<br/>Wash cell pellet twice in 1x PBS, keep on ice. Each gel plug has 6 x 10<sup>5</sup> stromal fibroblastic cells + 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> epithelial cells.

Then center collagen coated nylon on top.</li><li>Pop out cell-matrix gel plugs prepared on the previous day with the cell mixture (see Figure 1, bottom row) by pipetting 200 Âµl medium against the side of each well, using a 200 Âµl pipette. Catch gels in a sterile 10 cm dish containing medium as they slide out of the wells. </li><li><strong><u>Placing gel plugs on grid.</u></strong> Transfer 3 gels onto each collagen coated nylon with sterile forceps and around add 2-3 ml medium to just touch the bottom of the nylon to allow wicking to each of the individual gel plugs. Do not immerse the gels completely in the media, they must have the top surface exposed to the air. Treatments may be added to the media and changed as often as desired. </li><li>Replenish medium every other day or as needed if the medium level has dropped below nylon and culture up to 10 days in hypoxic conditions (2% O<sub>2</sub>). <br/><em>Notes:</em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em>The limit to keep gel plugs has been 10 days in our hands.
