            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>In many fields of biology, especially in the field of developmental biology, <em>LacZ</em> reporter staining is an approach used to monitor gene expression patterns. In the <em>LacZ</em> reporter system, the <em>LacZ</em> gene is inserted in the endogenous location of the target gene via gene knock-in or by constructing a transgenic cassette in which <em>LacZ</em> is placed downstream of the promoter of the target gene being examined. Currently, the most common <em>LacZ</em> staining methods used are X-gal/FeCN staining and S-gal/TNBT staining. A serious limitation of both of these methods is that they are not effective when the <em>LacZ</em> gene is expressed at a low level. In an attempt to remedy this problem, we have established a new staining protocol which combines both methods. When compared to them, the method described here is better for visualizing lowly expressed genes and it has low background with high sensitivity.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The <em>LacZ</em> gene has been widely used as a reporter gene for detecting gene expression patterns (Stevens <em>et al.</em>, 1989; Bonnerot and Nicolas, 1993). The protein encoded by the <em>LacZ</em> gene is Î²-galactosidase, which is able to produce visible color when incubated with specific substrates. Usually, <em>LacZ</em> is placed downstream of a target gene promoter in lieu of the coding sequence of the gene. Therefore, visualizing <em>LacZ</em> expression patterns models the endogenous expression pattern of the target gene (Figure 1A). The most popular <em>LacZ</em> staining approach is the X-gal/FeCN method, in which Î²-galactosidase catalyzes X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-Î²-D-galactopyranoside) hydrolysis into 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole and galactose. Then, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole is oxidized into an insoluble blue dimer with the help of potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide, which finally displays blue color (Figure 1B) (Pearson <em>et al.</em>, 1963; Lojda, 1970). While the X-gal/FeCN staining method is highly specific and has low background, it is unable to detect genes expressed at low levels due to the low sensitivity of this stain (Gugliotta <em>et al.</em>, 1992; Sundararajan <em>et al.</em>, 2012). The S-gal/TNBT staining method was developed to study genes with low expression. S-gal (6-Chloro-3-indolyl-Î²-D-galactopyranoside), a chromogenic substrate like X-gal, can be hydrolyzed by Î²-galactosidase and TNBT (Tetranitro Blue Tetrazolium) to produce dark-brown formazan compounds under reducing conditions (Figure 1C). The S-gal/TNBT method is more sensitive than the X-gal/FeCN one, but a drawback is that it can have strong non-specific background staining (Sundararajan <em>et al.</em>, 2012).<br/><br/>By combining both the methods described above, we developed an improved <em>LacZ</em> reporter staining protocol that is highly sensitive and highly specific. This method adds an additional staining step from the S-gal/TNBT method to the X-gal/FeCN method. In our staining technique, the first staining step, which is from the X-gal/FeCN method, creates an oxidative environment which consumes non-specific enzymatic activity; the second step, which is from the S-gal/TNBT method, is a reaction that is specific for Î²-galactosidase and results in a sensitive and specific signal. The improved method described here has been validated by detecting several genes in different embryo stages. Furthermore, this method has been used to study relatively highly expressed genes with good results: strong and specific staining, with slightly higher background than the X-gal/FeCN method (Shen <em>et al.</em>, 2017).<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190221/20190221235820_2382.jpg" width="180"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.
