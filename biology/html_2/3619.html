            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Ectopic expression of transcription factor combinations has been recently demonstrated to reprogram differentiated somatic cells towards the dendritic cell (DC) lineage without reversion to a multipotent state. DCs have the ability to induce potent and long-lasting adaptive immune responses. In particular, conventional type 1 DCs (cDC1s) excel on antigen cross-presentation, a critical step for inducing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxic responses. The rarity of naturally occurring cDC1s and lack of <em>in vitro</em> methodologies for the generation of pure cDC1 populations strongly hinders the study of cDC1 lineage specification and function. Here, we describe a protocol for the generation of induced DCs (iDCs) by lentiviral-mediated expression of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. iDCs acquire DC morphology, cDC1 phenotype and transcriptional signatures within 9 days. iDCs generated with this protocol acquire functional ability to respond to inflammatory stimuli, engulf dead cells, process and cross-present antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. DC reprogramming provides a simple and tractable system to generate high numbers of cDC1-like cells for high content screening, opening new avenues to better understand cDC1 specification and function. In the future, faithful induction of cDC1 fate in fibroblasts may lead to the generation of patient-specific DCs for vaccination.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells specialized in the recognition, processing and presentation of antigens to T cells, playing a pivotal role in the induction of adaptive immune responses and immunological memory (Merad <em>et al.</em>, 2013). DCs can be divided into 4 main subsets: plasmacytoid DCs (pDC), producers of large amounts of type 1 interferons, monocyte-derived DCs, derived from circulating monocytes, and conventional DCs (cDC), a functionally heterogeneous subset further subdivided in conventional DCs type 1 (cDC1) and type 2 (cDC2). While cDC1s excel on priming cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses by cross-presenting exogenous antigens on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, cDC2s are specialized in the presentation of extracellular antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells via MHC class II. This functional specialization results from stage-specific interplay between different transcription factors (TFs) that specify DC subsets. For instance, it has been shown that conditional deletion of E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family TF PU.1 in hematopoietic progenitors impacts the specification of the whole DC lineage (Carotta <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) knock-out mice lack pDC and cDC1 subsets, and basic leucine zipper ATF-Like transcription factor 3 (BATF3) deficient mice have impaired cDC1 specification (Schiavoni <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Hildner <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Carotta <em>et al.</em>, 2010).<br/> <br/>Growing evidence supports the crucial role of cDC1s in initiating immune responses in the context of cancer (Bottcher and Reis, 2018), and their <em>in vivo</em> rarity has propelled attempts to generate cDC1 <em>in vitro</em> (Perez and De Palma, 2019; Wculek <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Several strategies have been explored to generate <em>bona fide</em> DCs from blood monocytes or bone marrow (BM) precursors in the presence of different hematopoietic cytokines (Inaba <em>et al.</em>, 1992; Lu <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Lutz <em>et al.</em>, 1999; Son <em>et al.</em>, 2002; Naik <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Poulin <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Proietto <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Balan <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Mayer <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Lee <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Balan <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Kirkling <em>et al.</em>, 2018). However, limiting numbers of BM progenitors, together with the generation of mixed populations of DC subsets with conflicting functions, strongly limits the use of these approaches to elucidate DC development and harness cDC1s for therapy (Yona and Mildner, 2018).<br/> <br/>Cell reprogramming offers an exciting opportunity to overcome these challenges. Through enforced expression of TFs, it is possible to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Takahashi <em>et al.</em>, 2007). Protocols to differentiate DCs from iPSCs have been described (Choi <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Senju <em>et al.</em>, 2009 and 2011; Horton <em>et al.</em>, 2019). However, these rely on complex and long culture conditions that give rise to mixed populations of distinct DC subsets. Alternatively, somatic cells can be reprogrammed directly into other specialized cell types without transiting through pluripotency or multipotency. Mouse and human fibroblasts were directly reprogrammed into several cell types, such as neurons, cardiomyocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, using TFs specifying target-cell identity (Pereira <em>et al.</em>, 2012 and 2013, Xu <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/> <br/>Here, we describe a direct cell reprogramming approach to generate cDC1-like cells (induced DCs, or iDCs) by enforced expression of the TFs PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Rosa <em>et al.</em>, 2018). MEF-derived iDCs acquire DC morphology, cDC1 phenotype and transcriptional program characteristic of natural cDC1s. Functionally, iDCs acquire the ability to respond to toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR4 stimuli, engulf protein and dead cells and, importantly, cross-present antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thus, the protocol described here enables the fast generation (within 9 days) of cDC1-like cells <em>in vitro</em> using a controlled and adaptable direct reprogramming approach suitable for screening studies aiming to better understand cDC1 developmental specification and functional maturation. This approach, coupled with pharmacological inhibition, gene knock-out or knock-down, will enable the discovery of regulators of DC specification acting individually or in combination (Pires <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Employing high-content screening methodologies based on recent CRISPR-Cas9 technologies in MEFs paves the way for defining novel critical regulators of cDC1 fate and how cross-presentation ability is established <em>de novo</em> in multiple cell types. In the future, DC reprogramming will serve as a platform to develop immunotherapies for cancer and infectious disease.</p>

Schematic representation of the protocol for direct reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to dendritic cells.</strong> Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from C57BL/6 wild type 13.5 days-old embryos. Embryos were dissected to remove the head (grey), liver and heart (red) and dissociated to a single-cell suspension. MEFs were plated and allowed to grow to confluency (Passage 0, P0). Cells were dissociated and purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to remove contaminant hematopoietic cells (CD45<sup>+</sup> or MHC-II<sup>+</sup>) and expanded until passage 3 to 4. If a reporter was used such as the double homozygous Clec9a<sup>Cre/Cre</sup> Rosa<sup>tdTomato/tdTomato</sup>, tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells were removed as well. 250,000 MEFs were plated per 100 mm gelatin-coated Petri dish and transduced twice with lentiviral particles encoding PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3 (PIB) reprogramming factors (FUW-TetO-PIB), and M2rtTA (FUW-M2rtTA). Doxycycline (DOX) was added to the culture media (Day 0, d0) to induce expression of PU.1, IRF8 and BATF3 and reprogramming was followed by flow cytometry at reprogramming Day 5 (d5), 7 (d7), 8 (d8) and 9 (d9). Emergent induced dendritic cells (iDCs) may be purified by FACS and characterized by mRNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq), reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), immunofluorescence, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and functional assays at reprogramming day 9.</p><br/><ol class="npwone"><li>Isolation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts<br/><em>Note: MEFs can be purchased from vendors such as Sigma and ScienCell. In this case, thaw and expand fibroblasts, purify (Step A26), and use them in reprogramming experiments until passage 3 (P3) or P4.

If these are detected, isolate plugged females in individual cages and consider this time-point as Embryonic day (E) 0.5.<br/><em>Note: Plugs can be difficult to detect.

If needed, this tissue can be used for embryo genotyping.</li><li>Position the forceps underneath the red-colour visceral organs (fetal liver and heart) and remove them in order to avoid extensive contamination of MEF cultures with hematopoietic cells.</li><li>Transfer the dissected embryos to a new 100 mm dish without PBS. Using scissors cut the remaining embryonic tissue into small pieces. Add 1.5 ml of dissociation solution (see Recipes) per embryo, and transfer the tissue to a 50 ml conical tube.
