            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Studying social behavior in mouse models empowers the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms involved, which are affected in neuropsychiatric disorders, allowing the evaluation of therapeutic strategies. Behavioral methods available are time-consuming and reducing the length of behavioral sessions may render more manageable experiments and reduce animal stress. We validated a new reliable and sensitive method to study two features of social behavior (sociability and preference for social novelty) in two strains of male mice, the C57BL/6J inbreed strain and the CD1 (ICR) outbreed strain, using a modified version of the V-shaped maze (Vsoc-maze). The Vsoc-maze for sociability and preference for social novelty improves time performance by shortening the length of the sessions, and reduces variability compared to the classical approach performed in the three-chamber apparatus. Altogether, the Vsoc-maze allows evaluating the specific alterations of social behavior in mice in a time-efficient and reproducible manner.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Social behaviors are important in numerous species to establish the networks and relationships that define social communities (Berry and Bronson, 1992). Among those behaviors, sociability is defined as the tendency to seek out social interaction (Caldwell, 2012). Some neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) display a marked alteration in sociability combined with other features (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This characteristic highlights the need for experimental behavioral settings in animal models to address the research on such complex multi-facetted disorders (Caldwell, 2012). <em>Mus musculus</em> is a social specie showing reciprocal social interactions, sexual and parenting behaviors, territorial scent marking and aggressive behaviors (Ricceri <em>et al</em>., 2007; Silverman <em>et al</em>., 2010). The wide repertoire of mouse behaviors makes this specie suitable for modeling human disorders characterized by disruptions in social recognition and social behavior (Crawley, 2004; Yang <em>et al</em>., 2007). Such rodent models warrant the evaluation of potential therapeutic approaches for treatment (Moy <em>et al</em>., 2004). Commonly, mice conserve a characteristic pattern of social behavior, initiating social contact and approach when exposed to an unfamiliar conspecific (Moy <em>et al</em>., 2004).<br/><br/>Several paradigms have been described to measure social behavior in mouse models (Silverman <em>et al</em>., 2010). Among those, the most common is the Crawleyâs sociability test also called three-chamber apparatus (Chadman <em>et al</em>., 2008; McFarlane <em>et al</em>., 2008; Moy <em>et al</em>., 2008), which allows to study two different parameters: sociability and preference for social novelty. Sociability is defined as the tendency of the experimental mouse to spend more time exploring an unfamiliar mouse than exploring an object or an empty chamber. Instead, preference for social novelty is defined as the propensity to spend more time exploring a new unfamiliar mouse than the now-familiar mouse that was explored in the sociability phase (Moy <em>et al</em>., 2004; Yang <em>et al</em>., 2011). Due to the length of the different phases in the Crawleyâs sociability test, the procedure is time-consuming and experimental variability is sometimes troublesome.<br/><br/>We have adapted a V-maze, previously used successfully to evaluate novel object-recognition memory (Puighermanal <em>et al</em>., 2009; Busquets-Garcia <em>et al</em>., 2011 and 2013; Navarro-Romero <em>et al</em>., 2019), to assess social behavior. We found that the procedure using this new maze (Vsoc-maze) provides an advantageous approach in terms of time, while maintaining accuracy, to reveal particular social phenotypes in two mouse lines frequently used in biomedical research.</p>

It consists of two structures: the maze wall (150 mm high), made of black Plexiglas (6 mm width) and the maze lid, made of transparent Plexiglas. Corridors in the Vsoc-maze are 300 mm long and 45 mm wide (internal measures). Two small chambers (82 mm long) were created at the end of the corridors when the lid was inserted into the Vsoc-maze. These chambers were used to allocate the juvenile stranger mice.

The juvenile stranger mice were enclosed in a round wire cage in the side chambers. The wire cage was 110 mm high x 105 mm diameter and had vertical bars spaced 10 mm, which allow sniffing and exploration. There was a weighted cup on top of the wire cage to prevent the experimental animal from climbing. </li><li>Video Camera (<em>e.g.</em>, Sony Handycam camcorder, HDR-CX240)</li><li>Stopwatches (x2) (<em>e.g.</em>, Sper Scientific, 810029)<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191011/20191011010004_0140.jpg" width="250"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

A digital camera on top of the maze was used to record the sessions. On-line image in a contiguous room was available to the observer through a close-circuit camera situated on top of the maze. All three phases of the social test (habituation, sociability and preference for social novelty) were performed consecutively (Figure 2). Vsoc-maze phases lasted 5 min as it has been described that during the first five minutes of interaction the majority of the social behaviors take place (Nadler <em>et al</em>., 2004). The sessions in the three-chamber apparatus usually lasts 10 min (Kaidanovich-Beilin <em>et al</em>., 2011). For comparison purpose, exploratory behavior in the three-chamber apparatus was computed at 5 min (Figure 3) and 10 min (Figure 4).<br/>  All mice were housed four per cage and maintained in standard environment conditions of temperature (21 Â°C Â± 1 Â°C) and humidity (55% Â± 10%) with food and water <em>ad libitum</em>. All the experiments were performed during the light phase of the dark/light cycle (lights on at 8 a.m. and off at 8 p.m.). Before starting the experiment, mice were habituated in the experimental room and handled for 1 week.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191011/20191011010030_8424.jpg" width="250"/><br/><strong>Figure 2. Scheme of the sociability and preference for social novelty test</strong> (MartÃ­nez-Navarro <em>et al</em>., 2019). There are three different phases: Phase I (habituation), Phase II (sociability) and Phase III (preference for social novelty). Each phase lasts 5 min. During this time the exploration of the experimental mouse towards the chambers at the end of the corridors was recorded on the three phases: both chambers empty (Phase I), stranger-1 (STR 1) vs. empty chamber (Phase II) and stranger-1 (STR 1) vs. stranger-2 (STR 2) (Phase III).</p><br/><ol class="npwone"><li>Habituation session (Phase I)<br/>The habituation session allows mice to freely explore and familiarize with the Vsoc-maze.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>To record the whole experiment, turn on the video recording system.</li><li>Place the experimental mouse by lifting the Vsoc-maze, with the chambers empty, at the starting point (crossing-point between both arms). </li><li>Let the experimental mouse explore the maze for 5 min.</li><li>During this time, use two stopwatches and assign each stopwatch to count the exploration time of each chamber.

There is no need to move the experimental mouse from the Vsoc-maze.</em> </li><li><em>Although in our experience it would not be necessary, an inter-trial period could be included in which the experimental mouse is removed from the Vsoc-maze after habituation. During the inter-trial period the stranger 1 (STR 1) is placed in the chamber (see Sociability session, Phase II). Performing this inter-trial period may avoid experimenterâs manipulation of the maze while the experimental mouse is inside the Vsoc-maze. Moreover, it would allow cleaning any urine or defecation in the Vsoc-maze which may affect the exploratory behavior of the experimental mouse during the next Phases of the procedure.</em><br/></li></ol><br/></li><li>Sociability session (Phase II)<br/>The sociability session is performed just after the habituation session.<ol class="npwtwo"><li>A juvenile mouse assigned as (STR 1) is placed in one of the small chambers located at the end of one of the corridors (both corridors were alternated during the experiments).

Experimental mice may reduce the interest for exploring STR 1 as the Phase II progresses, as shown elsewhere (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014).

In order to compare time efficiency between mazes, both strains were analyzed for 5 min in the Vsoc-maze (Figure 3) and for 5 min (Figure 3) and 10 min (Figure 4) in the three-chamber maze. The Vsoc-maze setting provided quite similar results in the habituation session (Phase I) for both strains (Figures 3A and 3B). These results were variable for CD1 mice in the three-chamber maze (Figure 3B). In the sociability phase (Phase II), both mouse strains demonstrated a significant preference (P &lt; 0.001) for the chamber containing the juvenile STR 1 compared to the empty chamber. Such preference was evident in the 5 min period in both mazes (Figures 3C and 3D) and in the 10 min for the three-chamber apparatus (Figure 4). Finally, on the 5 min session to assess preference for social novelty (Phase III), only mice analyzed in the Vsoc-maze, independent of their strain, showed a significant predilection (P &lt; 0.001) for exploring the new-unfamiliar juvenile mouse (STR 2) compared to the now-familiar mouse (STR 1) (Figures 3E and 3F and Figure 4). C57BL/6J mice took longer to show a clear preference for social novelty in the three-chamber maze since such preference was only apparent after 10 min (Figure 3E and Figure 4A). Alternatively results can be represented using a social index (Figure 5).<br/></em> <br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191011/20191011010057_2374.jpg" width="250"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.
