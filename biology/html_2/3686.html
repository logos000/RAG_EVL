            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The skeletal muscle is key for body mobility and motor performance, but aging and diseases often lead to progressive loss of muscle mass due to wasting or degeneration of muscle cells. Muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) represent a population of tissue stem cells residing in the skeletal muscles and are responsible for homeostatic maintenance and regeneration of skeletal muscles. Growth, injury, and degenerative signals activate MuSCs, which then proliferate (proliferating MuSCs are called myoblasts), differentiate and fuse with existing multinuclear muscle cells (myofibers) to mediate muscle growth and repair. Here, we describe a protocol for isolating MuSCs from skeletal muscles of mice for <em>in vitro</em> analysis. In addition, we provide a detailed protocol on how to culture and differentiate primary myoblasts into myotubes and an immunofluorescent staining procedure to characterize the cells. These methods are essential for modeling regenerative myogenesis <em>in vitro</em> to understand the dynamics, function and molecular regulation of MuSCs.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Muscle homeostasis, maintained by diverse cellular functions, is vital for preserving muscle integrity. Tissue specific adult stem cells are capable of regenerating local tissues continuously throughout life. In adult skeletal muscles, a population of stem cells called muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) possess a robust regenerative capacity that is key for muscle homeostasis (Yin <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Quiescent MuSCs reside in a niche beneath the basal lamina juxtaposed to the muscle fiber and are responsible for growth and regeneration of muscle (Yin <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Dumont <em>et al.</em>, 2016).<br/><br/>MuSCs are a heterogeneous population with diverse cellular and molecular profiles. Quiescent MuSCs, identified by the expression of Pax7, are activated and enter a proliferating stage in response to external stimuli such as growth factors, injury, or pathological conditions (Kuang <em>et al.</em>, 2008). The proliferating myoblasts undergo several rounds of cell division and terminally differentiate into mononuclear myocytes, which fuse into myotubes to mediate muscle repair (Rudnicki <em>et al.</em>, 2008). A dynamic balance between asymmetric and symmetric division is also important for determining the fate of myogenic cells in terms of self-renewal and expansion (Kuang <em>et al.</em>, 2007).<br/><br/>Primary myoblasts (referring to MuSCs that are isolated from muscle) and the derived myotubes are important for modeling MuSC function and muscle physiology <em>in vitro</em>. Several methods for the isolation of primary myoblasts have been reported to investigate their cell biology (<em>i.e.</em>, proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation) and molecular regulation. One method involves enzymatic digestion of muscle tissues to liberate single myofibers that carry MuSCs to model <em>in vivo</em> behavior of MuSCs while they are still in their native niche (Shefer <em>et al.</em>, 2005). Another method involves fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), an efficient and widely used technique for selecting rare cell populations from various tissues. FACS-mediated purification of MuSCs from other muscle resident cells such as fibroblasts and immune cells involves the use of positive selection markers (<em>e.g.</em>, CD34, Integrin Î±7 and Vcam1) and negative selection markers (<em>e.g.</em>, CD45, CD31, CD11b, and Sca1) (Liu <em>et al.</em>, 2015). FACS requires a flow cytometer machine that is not available to many labs, and a prolonged sorting process that often reduces the viability of cells. Alternatively, MuSCs and primary myoblasts can be enriched using other more affordable methods, such as magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) (Motohashi <em>et al.</em>, 2014). However, MACS also requires antibodies and beads to eliminate non-muscle cells, and the number of cells that can be isolated is limited by the column and the speed of MACS isolation is slow as the mixture of cells flow through MS column by gravity. Finally, primary myoblasts can be enriched simply through a procedure of serial pre-plating based on differential affinity of different cell types to culture substrate.<br/><br/>Here, we describe a protocol for convenient and efficient purification of primary myoblasts from hind limb muscles of mice (Yue <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Jia <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This method consists of mechanical mincing followed by enzymatic digestion to release mononuclear cells, and selection of MuSCs by FACS. The process of primary myoblast isolation includes muscle dissection and digestion by collagenase type II and dispase, followed by myoblast purification through multiple rounds of pre-plating. Pre-plating is essential to purify a population of MuSCs on the basis of adhesion characteristics. We will also describe how to culture, differentiate, and validate pre-differentiation myoblasts and differentiated multinucleated myotubes using immunofluorescent staining for the expression of myogenic regulatory markers.<br/></p>
