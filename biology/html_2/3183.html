            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Thiol-disulfide exchange is a key posttranslational modification, determining the folding process of intra- and inter-protein structures. Thiols can be detected by colorimetric reagents, which are stoichiometrically reduced by free thiols, and by fluorescent adducts, showing fluorescence only after thioester formation. We adapted a simple three-step method for detection of disulfide bonds in proteins. After irreversible blocking of protein thiols, disulfide bonds are reduced, followed by the detection of thiols. The approach presented here provides an economical procedure that can be used to obtain a global overview of the thiol-disulfide status of proteins in plants. This method allows the detection of modifications in samples on a gel and can be used for semi-quantitative analysis.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>The redox status of proteins plays a key role in a number of cellular processes. Thiol-disulfide exchange reactions support the redox control of plant responses to fluctuating light under natural environments via a photochemical electron transfer cascade for posttranslational modification of proteins. Whereas thiols (R-SH) have relatively higher reactivity than other cellular components and can be directly detected by a variety of reagents and separation techniques (Fahey <em>et al.</em>, 1980 and 1981; Newton <em>et al.</em>, 1981; Riddles <em>et al.</em>, 1983; Fenton and Fahey, 1986; Tyagarajan <em>et al.</em>, 2003), disulfide bonds (R-S-S-R) have no such chemical characteristics. Therefore, the most common methodology for the detection of disulfide bonds consists of a three-step procedure: blocking of thiols, reduction of disulfide bonds, and subsequent detection of additionally exposed thiols. Dithiothreitol (DTT) is a well-known and frequently used reducing agent for the protection and exposure of thiol groups of proteins. However, the use of DTT in the laboratory is undesirable because of its harmful odor. Moreover, it can subsequently interfere with thiol detection reagents unless it is appropriately removed (Getz <em>et al.</em>, 1999). Also, the reducing power of DTT is limited to pH &gt; 7. Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine-hydrochloride (TCEP) can be a promising alternative with advantages of being odorless and more effective in the reduction of disulfide bonds over a wide pH range from 1.5 to 8.5. Monobromobimane (mBB) has been used for fluorescent labeling of low molecular weight thiols by detecting fluorescent derivatives under a fluorescent microscope or with high-performance liquid chromatography (Fahey and Newton, 1987; Meyer <em>et al.</em>, 2001). This protocol describes a simple method for discriminate labeling with mBB of free thiols, disulfide bonds, and total thiols in plant protein extracts. Here, we show an example of the procedure using <em>Arabidopsis</em> leaves. Free thiols are labeled without any preprocessing (Figure 1A), whereas labeling of disulfide bonds requires blocking of free thiols by iodoacetamide (IAA) and reduction of disulfide bonds by TCEP before the mBB treatment (Figure 1B). Total labeling of thiols just after TCEP treatment is helpful to estimate the redox state of total thiols in protein extracts (Figure 1C). This simple method allows the detection of modifications in samples on a gel and can be used for semi-quantitative analysis and provides an overview of the redox state of thiol-containing proteins without any special equipment other than conventional protein electrophoresis and imaging systems.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190226/20190226213103_0750.jpg" width="180"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.

However, only on the basis of R-SH data, we cannot assess the redox state of thiol-containing proteins. Here, the R-S-S-R data show a slight increase in band intensity in the mutant and the âTotalâ data show a slight decrease in band intensity (Figure 2), suggesting that the mutant has an oxidizing atmosphere for thiol-containing proteins. The combined interpretation clearly raises the possibility that the mutant has an oxidizing atmosphere in thiol-containing proteins and the redox state may contribute to the decrease in the amount of thiol-containing proteins.</li><li>Figure 3 exemplifies several different cases to be assumed. Case A indicates comparable band intensities in R-SH staining between Col-0 and the mutant. Case B indicates the R-SH data, showing a decrease in band intensity in the mutant and Case C indicates the R-SH data, showing an increase in band intensity in the mutant.</li><li>In all these cases, interpretations about the redox state can be changed by the R-S-S-R data and the âTotalâ data (compare cases A1 to A2, B1 to B2, and C1 to C2).</li><li>For example, in Case B1, the R-S-S-R data demonstrating an increase in band intensity in the mutant support the interpretation based on the R-SH data, suggesting an oxidizing atmosphere in the mutant. On the other hand, in Case B2, the R-S-S-H data demonstrating a decrease in band intensity in the mutant is contrary to the hypothesis based on the R-SH data. The total (R-SH and R-S-S-R) data represent that the mutant has lesser variety of thiol-containing proteins. The combined interpretation raises the possibility that the mutant has a comparable redox state in thiol-containing proteins as Col-0 and, thereby, the free thiol might decrease in Case B2.</li><li>Many <em>Arabidopsis</em> mutants have a variety of proteome, resulting from comprehensive proteomic reorganization in response to mutations in various regulatory networks (Figure 3, Case B2 and C1). To minimize possible misinterpretations regarding the redox state of thiol-containing proteins, it is desirable to obtain not only the R-SH data, but also the R-S-S-R and total thiol data.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190226/20190226220407_8589.jpg" width="135"/><br/><strong>Figure 2.
