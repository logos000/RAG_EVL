            <h1>Measurement of Mitotic Spindle Angle and Mitotic Cell Distance in Fixed Tissue of <em>Drosophila</em> Larval Brains</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The positioning and the cleavage plane orientation of mitotic cells in pseudostratified epithelia (PSE) must be tightly regulated since failures in any of these processes might have fatal consequences during development. Here we present a simple method to determine the spindle orientation as well as the positioning of neuroepithelial mitotic cells within the Outer Proliferation Center (OPC) of <em>Drosophila</em> larval brains.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Pseudostratified epithelia (PSE) are epithelia in which the interphase nuclei of the epithelial cells dynamically position at different depths within the epithelial monolayer, while mitotic nuclei localize at the most apical side of the epithelium. PSE are usually highly proliferative tissues acting as organ precursors in many organisms, including the building blocks of the epiblast in the gastrulating mouse embryo, the pancreatic buds and different areas of the central nervous system in vertebrates, as well as the imaginal discs and the optic lobe anlage in <em>Drosophila</em> (Meyer <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Ichikawa <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Strzyz <em>et al.</em>, 2016).<br/><br/>Almost a century ago, Sauer observed that in PSE nuclei moved to the apical surface to divide (Sauer, 1935). The apical migration of nuclei is linked to the cell cycle progression, occurring at G2 phase, and it is known as Interkinetic Nuclear Migration (INM) or Pre-mitotic Rapid Apical Migration (PRAM). Thus, INM is responsible for the spatial organization of proliferating cells in PSE and the localization of mitotic nuclei at the PSE basal side is frequently linked to failures in INM (Tsuda <em>et al.</em>, 2009). The apical âmitotic zoneâ serves as a niche for signaling and spatial control of mitotic entry, and it has been recently shown that apical daughter cells reintegrate better into the PSE (reviewed in Norden, 2017). <br/><br/>Better known is the control of the mitotic spindle orientation, which will determine tissue architecture or cell fate specification in the context of symmetric or asymmetric cell divisions, respectively. As failures in both processes are implicated in tumorigenesis, spindle misorientation might promote or, at least, facilitate tumor development (Pease and Tirnauer 2011; Noatynska <em>et al.</em>, 2012, Bergstralh and St Johnston 2014). Epithelial cells tend to divide with their mitotic spindle parallel to the plane of the epithelial sheet. The significance of tightly regulating this process during early development, when epithelia are in a high proliferative phase, is manifest by the existence of several neurological diseases associated with mitotic spindle orientation failures, such as microcephaly, lissencephaly and Huntington disease (Noatynska <em>et al.</em>, 2012).<br/><br/>Several protocols for 3D automated measurements of mitotic spindles have been recently published (Juschke<em>et al.</em>, 2014; LÃ¡zaro-DiÃ©guez <em>et al.</em>, 2014). Although these protocols are very reliable as they eliminate any bias due to hand processing of the images, they are established to work <em>in vitro</em>, in cell culture. In Franco and Carmena (2019), we have developed a simple and reliable method to determine the angle of the mitotic spindle and the positioning of the mitotic nucleus of neuroepithelial cells in fixed whole brains of <em>Drosophila</em> third instar larvae, making possible to visualize <em>in vivo</em>, the morphogenetic consequences of failures in any of these processes. Since planar divisions and INM are considered hallmarks of some neural progenitors, these measurements can be an effective way of studying the architecture and organization of a developing neuroepithelium.</p>

For example, in Franco and Carmena (2019), we determined that 80% of the cells in the control divide in the most apical part (0-40%) of the NE. Even though we could not find a straight correlation between failures in positioning and spindle orientation, we could conclude that basal mitosis was more prone to show defects in mitotic spindle alignment.</p><p class="pptt" id="biaoti37451">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>PBS<br/>10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub><br/>2.68 mM KCl<br/>140 mM NaCl<br/>pH 7.4<br/>Sterilize by autoclaving<br/></li><li>PBT<br/>PBS with 0.3% Triton<br/></li><li>Blocking Reagent<br/>PBT with 0.1% BSA <br/></li><li>4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBT-0.1T<br/>Dilute 16% PFA in PBS with 0.1333 % Triton<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti37452">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">Our lab was supported by the Spanish grants from the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) BFU2012-33020 and BFU2015-64251, and by FEDER (European Regional Development Fund).
