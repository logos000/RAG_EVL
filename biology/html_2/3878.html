            <h1>A Transient Transfection-based Cell Adhesion Assay with 293T Cells</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Rohit Singh, Beom K. Choi</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>The <em>in vitro</em> cell adhesion assay is a quantitative method for measuring selective cell adhesion to specific proteins. Traditionally, cell adhesion assays employ purified protein immobilized on a solid glass or plastic surface. Here, we describe a transient 293T cell transfection-based cell adhesion assay to study selective cell adhesion of a specific cell type to a protein of interest. In this protocol, 293T cells are transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid containing mSiglec1 cDNA or an empty plasmid as a mock control and are then cultured to form a monolayer. Subsequently, these Siglec1-expressing and mock-transfected 293T cell monolayers are used for cell adhesion assays with GFP-expressing B16F10 cells. The number of GFP<sup>+</sup> cancer cells adhering to each 293T monolayer is a quantitative mean to compare the selective adhesiveness of cancer cells to Siglec1. This method eliminates the need to express and purify the protein of interest to perform <em>in vitro</em> cell adhesion assays and can easily be performed with difficult-to-purify proteins while maintaining their native <em>in situ</em> structure.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Cell-to-cell interactions are critical for biological processes such as tissue development, regeneration, and morphogenesis, as well as immune responses and cancer metastasis (Gumbiner, 1996). The cell adhesion molecules that meditate these cell-to-cell interactions can be lectins, integrins, cadherins, selectins, lymphocyte homing receptors, or immunoglobulin super family receptors (Janiszewska <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Interactions between a cell surface receptor and counter-receptor on cell pairs initiate the stable cell-to-cell interactions and activation of tissue-specific signal transduction. Studying these interactions by using methods such as adhesion assays, co-immunoprecipitations, or pull-down assays is of utmost importance to understand the consequences of an individual protein-protein interaction in complex cellular processes. In cancer biology, cell-to-cell interactions are of particular interest for evaluating the role of host organ stroma in providing initial anchorage and a growth-promoting environment to metastatic cells (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Singh and Choi, 2019).<br/><br/>The <em>in vitro</em> cell adhesion assay is a simple low-cost method for investigating interactions between specific cell types and a protein of interest (Kucik and Wu, 2005). Conventionally, adhesion assays employ purified protein immobilized on a solid surface, such as the wells of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or cell culture plate (Chen, 2012). However, the molecular interactions that mediate the cell-to-cell contacts are often weak and low in affinity (Jiang and Barclay, 2009). This renders conventional cell adhesion assays inefficient in such situations. Additionally, it is cumbersome to perform cell adhesion assays with difficult-to-purify proteins. Recently, our group developed a 293T cell transient transfection-based cell adhesion assay to demonstrate interactions between highly sialylated B16F10 murine melanoma cells and sialic acid binding protein Siglec1 by using fluorescence microscopy (Singh and Choi, 2019). Here, we systematically describe the experimental procedures of 293T cell transient transfection-based cell adhesion assay adapted from our previously published work (Singh and Choi, 2019). This cell adhesion assay can be broadly applied to evaluate interactions between other receptors and cell types in addition to those mentioned above. The key advantage of this protocol is that, unlike the conventional adhesion assays, this method does not require purified proteins. Additionally, this method can be useful for studying interactions where the weak binding affinity with the protein of interest is the major restriction of the cell adhesion assay. The high expression of the protein of interest on the 293T cell surface may provide more interaction sites to bind to cells in the adhesion assay. Consequently, this improves cell adhesion by increasing the avidity (accumulated strength of low affinity interactions) of the interaction by forming more ligation bonds. This protocol can also be adapted to visualize protein-specific complex signaling events such as focal adhesion by using antibody staining and immunofluorescence microscopy.</p><br/>
