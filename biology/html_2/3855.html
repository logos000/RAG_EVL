            <h1>Quantitative Irreversible Tethering (qIT) for Target-directed Covalent Fragment Screening</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p>Small molecules that react to form covalent bonds with proteins are widely used as biological tools and therapeutic agents. Screening cysteine-reactive fragments against a protein target is an efficient way to identify chemical starting points for covalent probe development. Mass spectrometry is often used to identify the site and degree of covalent fragment binding. However, robust hit identification requires characterization of the kinetics of covalent binding that can be readily achieved using quantitative irreversible tethering. This screening platform uses a non-specific cysteine-reactive fluorogenic probe to monitor the rate of reaction between covalent fragments and cysteine containing biomolecules. Fragment libraries are simultaneously screened against the target protein and glutathione, which functions as a control, to identify hit fragments with kinetic selectivity for covalent modification of the target. Screening by quantitative irreversible tethering accounts for variations in the intrinsic reactivity of individual fragments enabling robust hit identification and ranking.</p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><p>Site-directed ligand discovery was first reported in 2000 and utilizes surface-exposed cysteine residues to covalently trap disulfide-linked fragments that bind at an adjacent pocket (Erlanson <em>et al.</em>, 2000). Since then, irreversible cysteine-targeting inhibitors have grown immensely in popularity and now represent front-line therapies in multiple oncology indications, with notable examples targeting BTK and EGFR as well as previously undruggable targets such as KRAS(G12C). Following these developments, covalent fragment-based ligand discovery has emerged as an efficient route towards the design of target-specific covalent inhibitors (Resnick <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Libraries of cysteine-reactive fragments are now commercially available from a range of compound vendors and utilize a variety of reaction types for covalent bond formation such as conjugate addition and nucleophilic substitution. Protein mass spectrometry was adopted early on as a useful assay for conducting covalent fragment screening, providing a direct readout on the extent and the site of fragment binding. However, even the earliest reports of covalent fragment-based ligand discovery emphasized the challenge that fragment-dependent electrophilicity presents (Nonoo <em>et al.</em>, 2012): the intrinsic reactivity of covalent fragments can vary by several orders of magnitude within a library. Fragments with high intrinsic reactivity will covalently bind to proteins regardless of their structure and this reactivity-driven binding does not constitute a useful starting point for fragment optimization. In pioneering work by Statsyuk, it was demonstrated that, through careful design of the reactive warhead architecture, it is possible to limit the variations in intrinsic reactivity, resulting in more robust screening outcomes (Kathman <em>et al.</em>, 2014). However, in many cases it is desirable to screen a wide variety of warhead structures, maximizing the exploration of chemical space and enlarging the pool of accessible targets (Keserű <em>et al.</em>, 2016).<br/> </p><p><br/>Quantitative irreversible tethering (qIT) is a plaform for screening cysteine-reactive fragments that has been designed to overcome the intrinsic reactivity problem (Craven <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The fluoregenic probe CPM (7-diethylamino-3-(4'-Maleimidylphenyl)-4-Methylcoumarin) is used to quantify the rate of reaction between covalent fragments and cysteine residues. Covalent fragments are simultaneously screened against glutathione (GSH) as well as the target protein and the rates of reactions (<em>k</em><sub>obs</sub>) determined in high-throughput. GSH functions as a control cysteine containing biomolecule that lacks significant secondary structure. The rate of reaction between a fragment and GSH represents a measure of the covalent fragment’s intrinsic reactivity. Hit fragments are those that react significantly faster with the target protein than with GSH, as quantified by the rate enhancement factor (REF = <em>k</em><sub>obs</sub>(target)/<em>k</em><sub>obs</sub>(GSH). Screening by REF analysis ensures that qIT can be carried out in high-throughput and does not suffer from high false-positive/negative hit rates because it accounts for intrinsic fragment reactivity. The key advantage of screening by quantitative irreversible tethering is that, in accounting for intrinsic fragment reactivity, true hits can be readily distinguished from non-selective reactive molecules which otherwise lead to high levels of false positives. The platform is compatible with a broad range of cysteine-reactive fragments and is applicable to most cysteine-containing soluble protein domains. Additionally, the high-throughput nature and low cost of using a plate-based fluorescence readout means that quantitative irreversible tethering projects can be performed rapidly and with high efficiency.<br/> </p><p><br/>Since the original publication of qIT (Craven <em>et al.</em>, 2018), we have updated the screening protocol to make it more applicable to a wider variety of proteins by changing the buffer system, more high-throughput by reformatting from 96-well to 384-well format and easier to implement by changing the environment of operation from 4 °C to room temperature. In our lab we have successfully applied this updated protocol to a range of protein classes including kinases, GTPases, oxidoreductase and proteases.</p><br/></p>

It may also be desirable to rescreen hits at multiple concentrations (<em>e.g.</em>, 500, 250, 100 and 50 ÂµM) to gain further insights into the concentration dependency of the modifications. Where possible, hits should then be orthogonally validated by mass spectrometry, biochemical assays and/or X-ray crystallography. For an example of how to conduct hit-follow up please see our recent publication on qIT (       Craven <em>et al.</em>, 2020      ).</p></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti39252">### Notes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>Where possible, the structure of the target protein should be analyzed to identify any cysteine residues that are likely to be exposed to solvent. In cases where the target has more than one solvent-exposed cysteine residue, site-directed mutagenesis should be applied to generate a construct containing only the target cysteine residue on the surface. Point-mutations can affect the structure or biochemical activity of the target protein and new constructs should be compared against the wild-type to check this has not taken place. Purification tags should also be free from cysteine residues or cleaved off. We generally recommend including reducing agents (such as DTT) in protein purification and storage buffers; however, these reducing agents must be fully removed prior to assay initiation, which can be readily achieved by buffer exchange using a PD-10 column.</p></li><li><p>Commercial vendors of cysteine-targeted covalent fragments include Enamine, LifeChemicals and Cominnex. A review of considerations for covalent fragment library design can also be found (Keeley <em>et al.</em>, 2020). Covalent fragment libraries should be subject to ongoing quality control. Storage in D<sub>6</sub>-DMSO enables periodic assessment of purity and degradation by NMR. If possible, freeze thaw cycles of DMSO stocks should be avoided to minimize the introduction of atmospheric water.</p></li><li><p>Edge effects typically arise from evaporation or temperature differences across the plate. We do not observe any edge effects in this protocol. But if they are observed, then care should be taken to minimize evaporation by sealing plates carefully when not in use and to ensure that all components are kept at room temperature. If edge effects are still observed then the plate layout can be redesigned to exclude the use of the outside wells of the plate.</p></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti39253">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>Reaction buffer</p><p>25 mM HEPES (pH 8.0)</p><p>150 mM NaCl</p></li><li><p>Quench buffer</p><p>25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)</p><p>150 mM NaCl</p></li></ol><p><em>Notes:</em> </p><ol class="npwthree"><li><p><em>Additional buffer components may be added to either the reaction buffer and/or quench buffer if required by the target protein for stability e.g., salts and glycerol.
