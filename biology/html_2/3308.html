            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Obesity is an important health problem with a strong environmental component that is acquiring pandemic proportion. The high availability of caloric dense foods promotes overeating potentially causing obesity. Animal models are key to validate novel therapeutic strategies, but researchers must carefully select the appropriate model to draw the right conclusions. Obesity is defined by an increased body mass index greater than 30 and characterized by an excess of adipose tissue. However, the regulation of food intake involves a close interrelationship between homeostatic and non-homeostatic factors. Studies in animal models have shown that intermittent access to sweetened or calorie-dense foods induces changes in feeding behavior. However, these studies are focused mainly on the final outcome (obesity) rather than on the primary dysfunction underlying the overeating of palatable foods. We describe a protocol to study overeating in mice using diet-induced obesity (DIO). This method can be applied to free choice between palatable food and a standard rodent chow or to forced intake of calorie-dense and/or palatable diets. Exposure to such diets is sufficient to promote changes in meal pattern that we register and analyze during the period of weight gain allowing the longitudinal characterization of feeding behavior in mice. Abnormal eating behaviors such as binge eating or snacking, behavioral alterations commonly observed in obese humans, can be detected using our protocol. In the free-choice procedure, mice develop a preference for the rewarding palatable food showing the reinforcing effect of this diet. Compulsive components of feeding are reflected by maintenance of feeding despite an adverse bitter taste caused by adulteration with quinine and by the negligence of standard chow when access to palatable food is ceased or temporally limited. Our strategy also enables to identify compulsive overeating in mice under a high-caloric regime by using limited food access and finally, we propose complementary behavioral tests to confirm the non-homeostatic food-taking triggered by these foods. Finally, we describe how to computationally explore large longitudinal behavioral datasets.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Research in rodents and humans has shown that exposure to food rich in sweets and fats increases the risk for obesity and compulsive eating behavior (Avena <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Exposure to such diets induces meal-pattern changes on patients defined by large meal size of dense caloric foods, rapid food consumption and loss of self-control during the eating episodes. Nevertheless, the development of such feeding behavior disturbances has not been studied, and intermediate states when changes in behavioral output occur remain obscure. These periods are particularly interesting because during weight gain, individuals may shift from non-pathological food consumption to compulsive overeating. In fact, short-term laboratory-based measures of eating in weight stable obese individuals may not be functionally relevant to understand long-term changes in body weight gain. <br/><br/>To address this, we used longitudinal meal pattern analysis for the study of obesity development (Espinosa-Carrasco <em>et al.</em>, 2018a). Here, we describe a diet-induced obesity protocol based on <em>ad libitum</em> access to high-fat and chocolate diets. The protocol combines continuous recording of mouse feeding behavior and the use of specific standalone behavioral tests. This longitudinal analysis allows researchers registering and analyzing the time-dependent appearance and evolution of behavioral and cognitive changes upon body weight increase. Water consumption is also measured since it is strongly linked to food intake and for example declines dramatically in fasted or food-restricted animals (Ellacott <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Goltstein <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Additional tests measure the preference for rewarding stimuli (<em>e.g</em>., voluntary sucrose intake: Towell <em>et al</em>., 1987) and help quantify the perception of reward (âlikingâ), whereas reward seeking (âwantingâ) is reflected by the intervals between feeding bouts. Inflexibility is a key indicator of compulsive feeding and can be assessed by temporally limiting the access to palatable food. A flexible response would result in a change to still available standard chow, whereas inflexibility would be revealed by neglect of the alternative (standard chow again). Other ways to search for compulsive components are to create a conflict by adulterating palatable food with bitter-tasting quinine (Heyne <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Di Segni <em>et al.</em>, 2014). The selected battery of tests, combined with the longitudinal food intake and motor activity recordings, enables i) a more comprehensive and in-depth characterization of the behavioral changes upon free access to palatable diets, ii) the examination of the etiological and susceptibility genetic factors and iii) the exploration of the basic mechanisms underlying compulsive overeating. </p>

<p class="pptt" id="biaoti28509">## Materials and Reagents</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>Mice <br/>Adult (12 weeks of age or older) male mice (C57BL/6J) (Charles River, LâArbresle, France, Strain Code 027), weighing 22-28 g at the beginning of the experiments. Mice are housed individually, each in their respective cages, in an environment with controlled temperature (around 23 Â°C) and humidity under a 12-12 h light-dark cycle with free access to food. Young adult mice (&gt; 12 weeks) are used to avoid a bias due to the increase of body weight of the developmental growth curve. <br/><em>Note: C57BL/6J mouse is chosen because it is widely used as a model for diet induced obesity since it is prone to develop severe obesity, elevated adiposity, glucose intolerance and moderate insulin resistance. However, other strains and ages of mice may also be used, but taking into account that strains such as SWR/J and A/J mice are more resistant to obesity development. The weight at the beginning of the experiments is just an indication (mean weight of C57BL/6J 12-weeks mouse). Of note, the initial weight of the animals could differ if a different strain is used.</em><br/></li><li>Diet<br/>In the diet-induced obesity protocol, animals can be allocated to receive free access of chocolate-mixture (CM) or exclusive access of high-fat diet (HF) for the study of obesity development as shown in Figure 1A. From now on, CM experiment is referred to as condition 1 and HF experiment as condition 2.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="147" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190711/20190711073411_2707.jpg" width="200"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Schematic representation of the main experimental procedures. </strong>A. Two different experiments were carried out each of them with a separate control group, namely condition 1 and condition 2. Control group in both conditions 1 and 2 received standard chow (SC) <em>ad libitum</em>. After the habituation period, in condition 1 case group was provided with a free-choice between a standard chow diet and a chocolate-mixture diet (CM), while in condition 2 case group was offered only a high-fat (HF) hypercaloric food. Sample size is shown in parentheses denoting the number of mice in each group. B. Timeline of the limited access to energy-dense foods test in condition 1 (above) and condition 2 (below). Overweight mice were offered CM (condition 1) or HF (condition 2) pellets a single hour during the light (resting) phase of the light-dark cycle for 3 consecutive days to measure feeding inflexibility. C. Representation of the setup used to evaluate compulsive-intake in diet-induced obese mice of condition 1 (above) and obese mice of condition 2 (below). Mice have restricted the access to food to 2 h per day at the beginning of the dark phase during 6 consecutive days. On Days 1, 3 and 5 control mice received standard chow, while case mice in condition 1 are given standard chow/chocolate mixture and case mice in condition 2 are presented with high-fat diet. On Days 2, 4 and 6 all animals received only standard chow.<br/><br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Standard chow (SDS, Witham, UK, catalog number: 801151)<br/>Standard chow contained 10.76 MJâkg<sup>-1</sup> digestible energy (17.5% coming from protein, 75% from carbohydrate and 7.4% from fat; Table 1).

Heat the mixture in a microwave oven at 350 W for 2 min to obtain a homogeneous mash. Extend the mixture while it is still melt on a smooth surface and as a result obtain a chocolate table of approximately two centimeters of thickness. Keep the resulting tablet in a refrigerator at least 24 h. Once solidified, cut the resulting tablet in small and equal pellets to obtain pellets that have a similar shape to the commercial standard chow pellet.</li></ol><em>Note: Because the organoleptic properties of the food have an impact on the hedonic value, the homogeneity of the mixture during the extension of the tablet is crucial. In the same line, we recommend storing the chocolate in the fridge until giving to animals.

Between these periods the system is paused during approximately one hour, for refilling the feeders and the cleaning of the cages.</li></ol><em>Notes: <br/></em> <ol class="npwthree"><li><em></em><em>All diets are offered ad libitum. At the end of the obesity development phase, the increase of body weight must be significant in case groups as compared with controls (approximately 40% higher weight for HF mice and 10% higher weight for CM mice, see Espinosa-Carrasco <em>et al.</em>, 2018a).

Twenty-four hours of food restriction is a powerful meal inducer having relatively little influence on its overall or long-term well-being (Toth and Gardiner, 2000). The increase in energy intake (KJ) after refeeding compared to free feeding conditions provides information on the influence of hunger on food seeking and food taking. </li><li>Restrict the access to food to 2 h per day at the beginning of the dark phase (20:30-22:30 h) for 6 consecutive days. On Days 1, 3 and 5 the available food is standard chow (for control), standard chow and chocolate mixture (case mice in <strong>Condition 1</strong>) or high-fat diet (case mice in <strong>Condition 2</strong>). Days 2, 4 and 6 only standard chow is available to all animals. Water is still provided <em>ad libitum.</em> No food is provided the rest of the day (22 h of starvation), see Figure 1B. This food-restriction schedule allows maintaining the motivation in mice that will be alternately exposed to their non-preferred and their preferred diets. It has been demonstrated to be safe before and mice do recover their body weight (Tucci <em>et al.</em>, 2006). <br/><em>Note: After the 6-day testing phase animals from both conditions are given ad libitum food access to allow the recovery of their normal weight and feeding behavior. For some mice it is common to find pieces of the HF pellets inside the cages. Over-taking is a signature of impulsivity and compulsion, and our main interest is modeling compulsive behavior. For this reason, we recommend using the Phecomp recordings with correction of the spillage (e.g., by subtracting the amount of non-eaten food inside the cage). Otherwise, we cannot assume the entire food intake registered corresponds to the real food eaten.<br/><br/></em> </li></ol><strong><em>Evaluation of the inflexible food taking</em><br/></strong> <ol class="npwtwo"><li>Limited access to energy-dense foods<br/>Restrict the access to CM or HF pellets to 1 h per day during the light (resting) phase of the light-dark cycle (from 14:00 to 15:00 h) for 3 consecutive days in overweight mice. Standard chow and water are still provided <em>ad libitum</em>, see Figure 1C.<br/><em>Note: The rest of the day all mice are fed with SC ad libitum. The test evaluates (i) inflexible behavior, flexible consumers are expected to restore standard chow intake whereas inflexible ones will reject standard chow and keep on waiting for its CM or HF; and (ii) compulsive intake binge-like eating episodes characterized by rapid consumption of high quantities of CM or HF during refeeding.</em> </li><li>Food adulteration with quinine hydrochloride<br/>Expose mice in condition 1 or condition 2 to adulterate (CM or HF) diet and standard diet during 24 h food <em>ad libitum</em> access. For food adulteration with Quinine hydrochloride, add 3 grams of quinine hydrochloride per kg of food during the chocolate mixture mash preparation. Stir the mixture to assure the concentration of quinine in the mixture is homogeneous.<br/><em>Note: Because of bitter taste may impair the hedonic characteristics of CM/HF, the rationale of this test is to identify inflexible consumers as an indicator of compulsive intake. Creating this conflict, flexible mice (self-controlled ones) change their consumption to unadulterated non-preferred food whilst inflexible consumers do not respond to this bitter taste and continue to take this food. The concentration of quinine chosen was determined experimentally to be aversive in C57BL/6J mice. Control mice are given choice between standard chow and adulterated standard chow to control for bitter taste detection. Weight, food consumption and water intake of all mice are measured before and after every test. </em> </li></ol><em>Note: Following the limited access 3-day test, animals are kept on their usual diet in ad libitum conditions to allow the recovery of their normal weight and feeding behavior. </em><br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28513">### Data analysis</p><p class="ppzz"><strong><em>Meal pattern analysis</em></strong><br/>Using the Phecomp cage system, we recorded single mouse solid and liquid intake for 9 weeks at 1-second resolution during the experiment. In this section, we summarize all the steps needed to visually explore the effect of the hypercaloric diet on circadian feeding rhythmicity.<br/><em>Note: The continuous signals from each weight transducer and the infrared frame are amplified, digitized and sent to the computer software for data acquisition and storage. </em><br/>    Along the acquisition process, meal pattern analysis was performed using the COMPULSE software (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). Meal pattern analysis included recording duration and recurrence intervals of eating or drinking acts, to calculate circadian and ultradian periodicities, and event-related frequency distributions. Feeding/drinking acts were considered as belonging to the <br/>same meal or drinking bout when separated by less than 120 seconds from the next feeding/drinking act and hence, were merged into single food/water bouts (see Heyne <em>et al.</em>, 2009).<br/>    The feeding parameters computed by the COMPULSE software and their biological significance are listed in Table 2.<br/>    For quantification of locomotor activity, we used the ActiTrack software (Panlab, Spain).<br/>    For the statistical analysis of meal pattern data, we used a linear mixed model and included the diet as a fixed effect. 'Mouse ID' was included as a random effect since we disposed of repeated measures in the case of the free choice mice. Differences are considered significant at <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05 upon subsequent <em>Bonferroni post-hoc</em> analyses. To quantify the circadian feeding rhythmicity loss, we used three-way repeated measures ANOVA (genotype, diet and phase). For analysis of energy intake during the testing phase we used two-way ANOVA with diet (SC, SC + CM, SC + HF) as factors between subjects. For each test, significance is considered when <em>P</em> &lt; 0.05.

The displayed period corresponds to the three first weeks of the experiment of condition 2 mice and its controls (barplot tracks in black and gray, respectively). The experimental design track can be found in the Zenodo archived data, see note under <em><strong>Longitudinal analysis </strong>step 2.</em><br/><br/></li><li>Alternatively, steps 3 to 5 can be performed using the Pergola web-server (Espinosa-Carrasco <em>et al.</em>, 2019).

Thus, tests were performed in a set order designed to minimize the effect of testing on following tests and with sufficient inter-test intervals to allow the mice to re-establish their previous feeding behavior.</li><li>Chocolate mixture and high fat must be removed from the cage and replaced with fresh food twice a week to assure the quality, texture and properties of the mixture are optimal.</li><li>PheCOMP cage must be carefully cleaned to avoid any rest of food or sawdust interferes with signal transduction. PheCOMP cages are cleaned every 2 weeks.<br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti28515">### Acknowledgments</p><p class="ppzz">We acknowledge the help of PRBB Animal facility and especially of Dr. Juan MartÃ­n Caballero.
