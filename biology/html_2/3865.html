            <h1>Antimicrobial Sensitivity Assay for <em>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</em></h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Emanuele Marine, Klaas M. Pos</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p><p><em>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</em>, an obligate predatory bacterium [<em>i.e.</em>, bacteria that kill and feed on other bacteria (prey)], has the potential to be used as a probiotic for the disinfection of surfaces or for the treatment of bacterial infections. One option is to use this organism in combination with antimicrobials to potentiate the effectiveness of treatments. In order to make this approach feasible more has to be known about the ability of <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> to resist antibiotics itself. Standard assays to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) are not suitable for <em>B. bacteriovorus</em>, since the small size of this bacterium (0.25-0.35 by 0.5-2 μm) prevents scattering at OD<sub>600</sub>. Since these predatory bacteria require larger prey bacteria for growth (<em>e.g., E. coli</em> dimensions are 1 by 1-2 μm), the basis for the antimicrobial sensitivity assay described here is the reduction of the OD<sub>600</sub> caused by prey lysis during growth. Previous studies on predatory bacteria resistance to antimicrobials employed methods that did not allow a direct comparison of antimicrobial resistance levels to those of other bacterial species. Here, we describe a procedure to determine <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> sensitivity to antimicrobials which can be compared to a reference organism tested as close as possible to the same experimental conditions. Briefly, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> are determined by measuring the reduction in absorbance at 600 nm of mixed predator/prey cultures in presence and absence of different antimicrobial concentrations. Of note, this method can be modified to obtain antimicrobial MIC values of other predatory bacteria, using different conditions, prey bacteria and/or antimicrobials.<br/> </p></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p><em>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</em> is a Gram-negative predatory bacterium that "predates" upon other Gram-negative bacteria species, growing at their expense and eventually killing them. <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> as well as other predatory bacteria have the potential to be used as probiotics for disinfection of surfaces or for the treatment of bacterial infections (Tyson and Elizabeth Sockett, 2017; Madhusoodanan <em>et al.</em>, 2019). The combined use of <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> with antimicrobials may enhance the effectiveness of these treatments. This necessarily entails <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> to resist the action of antimicrobials at their working concentration. Little is known on the antimicrobial susceptibility of <em>B. bacteriovorus</em>. However, the sequenced genomic DNA encodes membrane drug transporters (efflux pumps) and other antimicrobial resistance proteins (Rendulic <em>et al.</em>, 2004). The sensitivity of <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> to antimicrobials cannot be assessed by a standard broth dilution assay, as it requires the presence of prey bacteria to grow.<br/> <br/>In a 2014 study, Pasternak <em>et al.</em> made a first attempt to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity of predatory bacteria (<em>Micavibrio aeruginosavorus</em> EPB and <em>Bdellovibrio exovorus</em> JSS) by developing a modified antimicrobial disc diffusion method. However, this method provides a relative measure of antimicrobial resistance levels for the species analyzed, but does not allow to compare these values with those of non-predatory bacteria species as it does not use the same conditions of standardized assays (predatory bacteria require the presence of prey bacteria to grow).<br/> <br/>In a study by Im <em>et al.</em> (2017), <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> was used in combination with violacein (an antimicrobial active against Gram-positive bacteria) to treat mixed populations of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. The aim of the study was to demonstrate that this combined treatment was more effective than treatments with individual agents (<em>B. bacteriovorus</em> or violacein). The efficacy of the treatments was evaluated in terms of reduction in the titer of MDR bacterial cells and, therefore, did not provide an indication of the degree of general antimicrobial resistance in <em>B. bacteriovorus</em>.<br/> <br/>The method presented in this study allows to determine the MIC values of antimicrobials for <em>B. bacteriovorus</em>. Standard broth dilution assays (performed on non-predatory bacteria) are performed in liquid broth containing antimicrobial dilution series (typically two-fold dilutions) and are inoculated with a defined number of bacterial cells (5 x 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/ml). In order to test antimicrobials on <em>B. bacteriovorus</em>, the initial numbers of both <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> and prey bacterial cells have to be considered (initial predator to prey ratio, PPR). The numbers of <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> cells can be estimated reliably only after conducting the test (by plating in double layer agar plates), as their viability is strongly affected by culture conditions. Higher initial PPRs (comparable to a higher inoculum in standard broth dilution assays) can lead to an increased estimate of the antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC; <em>i.e.</em>, the lowest concentration (in mg/L) of the antimicrobial agent that prevents visible growth of a microorganism under defined conditions) (Wiegand <em>et al.</em>, 2007). The presented method requires the determination of different MIC values of a single antimicrobial at different initial PPR values. For this, serial two-fold dilutions of <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> cells and a fixed number of prey bacteria are added to a master plate with serial two-fold antimicrobial dilutions. In order to quantify the degree of resistance to a specific antimicrobial, the MICs determined at different initial PPRs must be reduced to a single value. This MIC value is obtained by curve fitting the MIC values at each PPR for each antimicrobial and definition of the MIC at the arbitrary initial PPR of 0.02 (which constitutes a low ratio that allows <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> to grow well and lyse almost all prey cells within 24 h under the experimental conditions). In order to compare the MIC values of <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> with that of other bacterial species, such as the prey bacteria, it is necessary to determine the MIC values under conditions resembling experimental conditions employed for <em>B. bacteriovorus</em>. In this way, the ratio between predatory and prey bacteria MIC values provides a comparative measure of the sensitivity to the antimicrobials tested on both species.<br/> <br/>This method may not allow the determination of absolute <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> MIC values for bactericidal antimicrobials at concentrations equal or higher than the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for the prey bacteria (Marine <em>et al.</em>, 2020). This is because <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> may not be able to grow on inactivated prey bacteria at concentrations equal or above their MBC, since this would result in a lower estimate of the MIC (this is true especially for lysed prey bacteria or those with a compromised structural integrity) (Marine <em>et al.</em>, 2020). To overcome this limitation, prey bacteria may be transformed with resistance genes for the specific antimicrobial tested and used in the <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> MIC assay. However, these resistance genes should not encode for a resistance mechanism that inactivates the antimicrobial. One possibility might be the use of resistance genes encoding multidrug resistance pumps (<em>e.g.</em>, AcrAB-TolC, MacAB-TolC, MdfA, <em>etc.</em>) that efflux antimicrobials out of the cell.<br/> <br/>The protocol presented below may be adapted to test other predatory bacteria, or use different experimental conditions (<em>i.e.</em>, culture broth, temperature, aeration, prey bacteria species), or can be used on different antimicrobials. The only limitation to our knowledge is the use of predatory bacteria that grow well within 24 h.</p>

To produce single colonies, sterilize the loop and gently drag the bacteria across the surface of the agar from the first section to another section of the plate by streaking through the first section. Repeat this step one or two more times to spread the bacteria from the second or third section to a new section of the plate* (         Slonczewski <em>et al.</em>, 2020        : Figure 4.11, p. 131).</p></li><li><p>Incubate plates upside down overnight in an incubator at 37 Â°C.

Inoculate the broth with 4 separately picked <em>E. coli</em> colonies using an inoculation loop* and incubate the culture at 37 Â°C with shaking at ~170 rpm overnight. This step has to be done late in the afternoon, so the <em>E. coli</em> cells do not overgrow.</p><p class="ppzz" style="margin-left:-30px;">Day 3:</p></li><li><p>Unscrew the lid of bottles containing bottom and top agar and melt the agar in a microwave (500 ml of bottom agar allow to cast around 20-25 plates; the amount of top agar required for 25 plates is 125 ml). Melting the agar may require several minutes, depending on the power setting and the amount of agar to be melted. Make sure that the cap of the bottle is partly unscrewed as to allow for boiling vapor to escape. We suggest to use a minimal power setting and to stop the microwave as soon as the liquified agar begins to boil. Take out the bottle and gently mix it by swirling (careful, when agitated the liquid agar can boil). Repeat heating in the microwave and mixing until all the agar is melted and there are no lumps visible. Then, briefly heat the agar one last time at a higher power setting to melt all remaining lumps not visible by eye.</p></li><li><p>Subsequently, place the bottles in a 55 Â°C water bath until they reach this temperature (Note 1).</p></li><li><p>Supplement both bottom and top agar with CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgSO<sub>4</sub> to a final concentration of 2 mM and 1 mM, respectively*.</p></li><li><p>Pour a layer (20-25 ml) of bottom agar in a Petri dish (diameter of 10 cm) and distribute it equally by gently swirling the Petri dish*.</p></li><li><p>Centrifuge 5 ml of an <em>E. coli</em> overnight culture and resuspend it in the exhausted broth of culture (which was used to grow cells) to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of ~10*.</p><p><em> Note: The relationship between OD<sub>600</sub> and cell biomass approximates linearity only at low absorbance values (usually up to 0.3-0.4, depending on the instrument and cuvettes). Therefore, serial dilutions (e.g., 1:2) of the E. coli overnight culture should be prepared for measuring the OD<sub>600</sub>. The construction of a graph of absorbance against dilution factors allows to determine the linear range of values. Linear regression can be used to calculate the OD<sub>600</sub> value of the undiluted overnight culture. </em> </p></li><li><p>Add 500 Î¼l of the concentrated overnight <em>E. coli</em> culture and 5 ml of the top agar in a 10 ml test tube*.</p></li><li><p>After capping the tube with a sterile lid, gently mix by inversion of the tube for 2 times (avoiding the formation of bubbles)*.</p></li><li><p>Quickly pour the agar onto the Petri dish containing the solidified bottom agar and distribute it evenly by gently swirling the Petri dish*. Leave the dish under the laminar flow hood for the agar to solidify with the lid semi-open.</p></li><li><p>Pipet 50 Î¼l of a thawed <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> glycerol stock (containing 20% (v/v) glycerol) in the center of the double layer agar plate (<em>i.e.</em>, a 2-layer plate consisting of bottom and top agar) with <em>E. coli</em> cells within the top agar*.</p></li><li><p>Leave this plate under the laminar flow hood with the lid semi-open to dry the <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> suspension*.</p></li><li><p>After the <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> suspension has dried (after approx. 30 min), seal the plate-lid and plate with parafilm to prevent it from drying out.</p></li><li><p>Incubate the plate for 2 to 3 days at 29 Â°C until a clear zone (plaque) on the agar is visible (due to <em>E. coli</em> lysis) at the center of the plate where the <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> suspension has been applied (Figure 1).</p><p><em> Note: Ca/Mg/HEPES double layer agar plates can be stored at room temperature for 2 weeks without significantly affecting B. bacteriovorus viability (Lambert et al., 2008). </em> </p><br/><p><img class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3865/bioprotoc-10-24-3865-g001.jpg"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> plaque on a double-layer agar plate. </strong> <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> revived from a glycerol stock form a large plaque on a double-layer plate (containing <em>E. coli</em> in the top agar) at the point of application.

Broth of cultures such as DNB (diluted nutrient broth), YT (yeast extract, trypton) and YPSC (yeast extract, peptone, sodium, calcium) have a low concentration of nutrients and result in slow bacterial growth rates and were originally used for the concomitant culturing of B. bacteriovorus and its preys (inoculation of fresh broth with both predatory and prey bacteria, at the same time). Although, most research groups grow B. bacteriovorus on stationary phase prey bacteria from overnight cultures, they still use DNB or YT broth (YPSC is used mostly for the concomitant growth in double layer agar plates). A critical point that affects predation efficiency (and therefore predatory bacteria growth) is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and pH of the buffer/broth of culture. Typically, B. bacteriovorus is cultivated at a pH of 7.2 to 7.6 and at a concentration of 2-3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and 1-3 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (either MgSO<sub>4</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Other broth components, such as peptone and yeast extract, seem to increase B. bacteriovorus viability and durability. </em> </p><p>Day 1:</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>Streak out <em>E. coli</em> prey cells on a LB 1% agar plate to get single colonies* and incubate overnight at 37 Â°C.</p><p class="ppzz" style="margin-left:-30px;">Day 2:</p></li><li><p>Pour 2 ml YT broth in a 15 ml tube.

Double layer plates are cast in two steps as a thick layer of agar at the bottom (i.e., bottom agar) and a thin layer on the top (i.e., top agar) containing prey and predatory bacteria. The bottom agar helps to maintain the top agar moist and soft, buffers against pH changes and provides nutrients to prey bacteria. The top agar has a low agar content (to increase the efficiency of plaque formation) and is poured as a thin layer so that plaques form on the surface of the agar (thus increasing visibility) and to prevent plaques from forming on top of each other.</em> </p><p>Day 7:</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>Unscrew the lid of a top agar bottle and melt the agar in a microwave.</p></li><li><p>Incubate the bottle in a water bath at 55 Â°C until it reaches this temperature (Note 1).</p></li><li><p>Supplement the top agar with CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgSO<sub>4</sub> to a final concentration of 2 mM and 1 mM, respectively*.</p></li><li><p>Centrifuge 5 ml of an <em>E. coli</em> overnight culture at 5,000 <em>x g</em> for 6 min and resuspend it in the exhausted broth of culture (which was used to grow cells) to a final OD<sub>600</sub> of ~10*.</p></li><li><p>Prepare ten-fold serial dilutions in Ca/Mg/HEPES buffer of the 25x diluted <em>B. bacteriovorus</em> culture (from Step C3)*.</p><p><em> Note: Place eight 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes in a rack and label them from -1 to -8.

Keeping the bottles in the water bath ensures, after a reasonable period of time, that they reach the set temperature of 55 Â°C (which can be determined by a thermometer placed in the water bath). The use of a higher temperature is not recommended as it kills bacteria. On the other hand, too low a temperature will cause the agar to solidify and result in an uneven surface of the cast agar.</p></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti39334">### Recipes</p><p><em>Note: Sterilize all buffers and broths by autoclaving.</em> </p><ol class="npwtwok"><li><p>CaCl<sub>2</sub> stock solution</p><p>200 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> </p></li><li><p>MgSO<sub>4</sub> stock solution</p><p>100 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> </p></li><li><p>YT broth</p><p>5 g/L yeast extract</p><p>10 g/L tryptone</p><p>5 g/L NaCl</p><p>2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> </p><p>1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> </p><p>Dissolve ingredients except CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgSO<sub>4</sub> and adjust pH of the medium to 7.6 with NaOH.
