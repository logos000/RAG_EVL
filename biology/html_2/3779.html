            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Growing evidences suggest that peritubular capillaries pericytes are the main source of scar-forming myofibroblasts during chronic kidney disease (CKD), as well as early phases of acute kidney injury (AKI). In a swine model of sepsis and I/R (Ischemia Reperfusion) injury-induced AKI we demonstrated that renal pericytes are able to transdifferentiate toward Î±-SMA<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts leading to interstitial fibrosis. Even if precise pericytes identification requires transmission electron microscopy and the co-immunostaining of several markers (<em>i.e.</em>, Gli, NG2 chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan, CD146, desmin or CD73) and emerging new markers (CD248 or TEM1, endosialin), previous studies suggested that PDGFR-Î² could be used as marker for renal pericytes characterization. Recently, double immunofluorescence staining of PDGFR-Î² and Î±-SMA was performed to identify the damage activated pericytes (PDGFR-Î²<sup>+</sup>/Î±-SMA<sup>+</sup> cells) in the early phase of fibrosis development. Our data highlighted the crucial role of renal pericytes in the physiopathology of sepsis and I/R associated AKI. In this protocol, we describe the procedure for double immunofluorescence staining of PDGFR-Î² and Î±-SMA in swine Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) kidney biopsies and the method for image analysis and quantification.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Renal fibrosis is considered the principal responsible for progression of renal disease and it is associated with a limited capacity of kidney to regenerate after injury. The principal source of interstitial fibrosis in progressive renal diseases (Simone<em> et al.</em>, 2014; Fiorentino <em>et al</em>., 2018) is represented by activated fibroblasts, named myofibroblasts, that are recognized by their ability to synthesize de novo Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) (Meran and Steadman, 2011; Hewitson, 2012). These cells derived from multiple sources, including not only resident fibroblasts, but also endothelial cells, tubular cells, circulating bone marrowâderived cells and pericytes (Di Carlo and Peduto, 2018). Several studies evaluated the critical role of capillary pericytes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Lin <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Grgic <em>et al</em>., 2012; Kramann <em>et al</em>., 2015) as well as early phases of acute kidney injury (AKI) (Leaf <em>et al</em>., 2016; Castellano<em> et al</em>., 2018 and 2019).<br/><br/>Recent studies revealed that dysfunctional pericytes are principally involved in sepsis-induced microvascular dysfunction and vascular leakage which are the key hallmarks of end-organ dysfunction and septic shock (Goldenberg<em> et al.</em>, 2011; Page and Liles, 2013; Castellano<em> et al.</em>, 2014; Stasi <em>et al</em>., 2017; Fani <em>et al</em>., 2018). Consistent with these findings, we found that pigs challenged with LPS led to a dysfunctional response of pericytes in the microvasculature of renal parenchyma (Castellano <em>et al</em>., 2019) <strong>(Figure 1)</strong>.<br/><br/>In recent years, the fate-tracing mapping and the ultrastructural analysis have shed more lights on the pericytes behavior in several mouse model of renal diseases (Lin <em>et al</em>., 2008; Humphreys <em>et al.</em>, 2010). In fairness, the identification of pericytes by criteria that requires elaborate techniques as fate-tracing analysis is not practical in large animal model. Since PDGFR-Î² is defined as the constitutive marker for isolation and characterization of renal pericytes (Chen <em>et al</em>., 2011; Wang <em>et al.</em>, 2017) and a-SMA is a marker associated with myofibroblasts (Hewitson, 2012), the double-labeling for PDGFR-Î² and Î±-SMA provide a âpictureâ of pericyte distribution and dysfunctional activation in renal parenchyma during AKI (Guzzi <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In accordance with other phenomena of cellular transdifferentation as EndMT, the loss of PDGFR-Î² and the increased level of Î±-SMA, Collagen I and MMP proteins is defined as Pericytes to Myofibroblast transition (PMT) (Chang <em>et al</em>., 2012).<br/><br/>We, firstly, performed double immunofluorescent staining of PDGFR-Î² and Î±âSMA to study the PMT in swine and mice models of renal I/R injury <strong>(Figure 2)</strong> (Castellano <em>et al</em>., 2018). Interestingly, in normal swine kidney biopsies we found the colocalization of the PDGFR-Î² and NG2 in peritubular capillaries, indicating the overall accuracy of PDGFR-Î² as capillary pericytes markers in pig models whereas glomerular mesangial cells were PDGFRÎ²<sup>+</sup> but NG2<sup>â.</sup> After 24h of renal I/R we observed the downregulation of the constitute markers PDGFR-Î² and NG2 and the dramatic upregulation of Î±-SMA.<br/><br/>These data were also confirmed in our sepsis model of AKI and taken together we demonstrated that PDGFR-Î²<sup>+</sup>pericytes are able to synthesize pro-fibrotic markers acquiring the typical features of myofibroblasts, leading to extracellular matrix deposition and interstitial fibrosis (Castellano <em>et al</em>., 2019). In accordance, we confirmed our data<em> in vitro</em> and we found that exposition of human placental derived pericytes to I/R injury (C5a) and sepsis stimuli (LPS) led to acquisition of Î±-SMA contractile stress fibers (Castellano <em>et al.</em>, 2018 and 2019).<br/><br/>Therefore, the protocol described here could be useful to characterize pericytes and their dysfunctional activation and will facilitate the research in the early acute kidney injury as well as other fields relating inflammation and fibrosis (Castellano <em>et al.</em>, 2018 and 2019).</p>

The values were then averaged. For each field, positive cells were counted only in the cortical area (peritubular and glomerular capillaries). Subcapsular fibrotic areas, arterial adventitia and medullary areas were excluded from the region of interest. Cell count was determined according to nuclear staining. The final reported count was the mean of the two observer measures. In no case was the interobserver variability greater than 20%.<br/>   Results are expressed as median Â± interquartile range (IQR) Statistically significant differences were assessed by the Mann-Whitney test. A <em>P</em> value &lt; 0.05 was significant. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Software 5 as indicated in Figure 3.</p><br/><p class="ppzz" style="margin-left:40px;"><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="350" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200923/20200923010108_1742.jpg" width="564"/><br/><strong>Figure 3.
