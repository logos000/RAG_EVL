            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The plant cell wall is a complex network of polysaccharides and proteins that provides strength and structural integrity to plant cells, as well as playing a vital role in growth, development, and defense response. Cell wall polysaccharides can be broadly grouped into three categories: cellulose, pectins, and hemicelluloses. Dynamic interactions between polysaccharides and cell wall-associated proteins contribute to regions of flexibility and rigidity within the cell wall, allowing for remodeling when necessary during growth, environmental adaptation, or stress response activation. These polysaccharide interactions are vital to plant growth, however they also contribute to the level of difficulty encountered when attempting to analyze cell wall structure and composition. In the past, lengthy protocols to quantify cell wall monosaccharides contributing to cellulose as well as neutral and acidic cell wall polysaccharides have been used. Recently, a streamlined approach for monosaccharide quantification was described. This protocol combines a simplified hydrolysis method followed by several runs of high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). Here, we present an updated version of this protocol in which we can analyze all nine cell wall monosaccharides in a single high-performance liquid chromatography HPAEC-PAD gradient profile. The inclusion of an enzymatic starch degradation, as well as alternate internal standards for added quantification accuracy, and a ready-to-use Python script facilitating data analysis adds a broadened scope of utility to this protocol. This protocol was used to analyze <em>Arabidopsis</em> light-grown seedlings and dark-grown hypocotyls, but is suitable for any plant tissues.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Understanding plant cell wall structure and composition have been at the forefront of both academic and industrial plant research for many years. Polysaccharide and cell wall protein interactions provide structure to plant cells, while also actively playing important biological roles during growth and adaptation to diverse external conditions (Cosgrove, 2005 and 2016; Kesten <em>et al.</em>, 2017). The plant cell wall acts as an important physical barrier during biotic or abiotic interactions, but can also provide an endogenous source of signaling molecules released during stress response (Cosgrove, 2005 and 2016; Kesten <em>et al.</em>, 2017 and 2019). These cell wall-derived molecules can activate signaling cascades to alert the plant host of an invading pathogen or a need to redirect growth resources. Cell wall polysaccharides are also important for industrial usesâpectins are widely used in the food and cosmetics industries, while cellulose is important for the food, paper, and textile industries (Pettolino <em>et al.</em>, 2012). As such, efficient and informative methods for characterizing plant cell wall polysaccharides are vital in both academia and industry to further understand the biological role of the plant cell wall and improve ease of polymer extraction while reducing waste during industrial applications.<br/> <br/>Experiments from the 1940s conducted in wood established the use of dilute acid hydrolysis at high temperature to study sugar decomposition into monomers (Saeman, 1945). Such studies have provided a foundation for many current protocols, including the one presented here. Streamlining this analysis has allowed us to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of our measurements. Other recently described protocols have established the combination of the widely-used trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) hydrolysis approach with a single HPLC run, or a dual sulfuric acid-based h ydrolysis method, referred to as a âone-step two-step sulfuric acid hydrolysisâ approach, with multiple HPAEC-PAD runs (Zhang <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Voiniciuc <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Yeats <em>et al.</em>, 2016a and 2016b). This âone-step two-stepâ approach makes use of a Saeman hydrolysis procedure followed by what has been previously referred to as a âmatrix hydrolysisâ (Yeats <em>et al.</em>, 2016a). Saeman hydrolysis, the âtwo-stepâ portion of this approach, is essentially the addition of concentrated sulfuric acid hydrolysis (72% sulfuric acid) directly to plant material in order to swell the sample. After one hour at room temperature, water is added to the sample to dilute the sulfuric acid concentration to 4%. This portion of the hydrolysis is then performed at 121 Â°C for one hour. The use of a dilute acid hydrolysis immediately following a strong acid swelling hydrolysis allows the release of glucose from all possible sources, including heavily cross-linked and rigidly packed cell wall components, such as crystalline cellulose. The âone-stepâ portion of the hydrolysis, also called the âmatrix hydrolysisâ, refers to the hydrolysis of samples only at 121 Â°C with 4% sulfuric acid. By simply treating samples with a âmatrix hydrolysisâ, only monosaccharides from easily hydrolysable sources will be released. Therefore, the difference between these two hydrolyses allows the quantification of crystalline cellulose in what is referred to as a âone-step two-stepâ hydrolysis approach. In our protocol, we combine the efficient âone-step two-stepâ sulfuric acid hydrolysis described by Yeats <em>et al.</em> (2016a) with the inclusion of an optional enzymatic starch degradation and the use of alternate internal standards to elute all cell wall sugars and quantify glucose derived from crystalline cellulose in a single HPAEC-PAD run. Our additions to the previously mentioned protocols contribute significant improvements in both ease and accuracy of monosaccharide measurement that will greatly benefit the field of plant cell wall research.</p>

This quantification will allow the reliable characterization of monosaccharide composition, and allows for the determination of proportions of glucose that come from both the crystalline and non-crystalline portions of the plant cell wall. For example, using wildtype (Col-0), and the well-characterized cellulose-deficient mutant and <em>prc1-1</em>, we demonstrate that this method is sufficient for resolving differences between cell wall mutants (Figure 5). Additionally, this analysis has already been used in a recent study to quantify differences in glucose derived from crystalline cellulose (Kesten <em>et al.</em>, 2019). This method is simple, reliable, and consistent, and can be used to better understand cell wall monosaccharide compositional changes in a biological context. Past methods rely on multiple hydrolyses approaches or HPLC gradients to quantify neutral cell wall monosaccharaides, uronic acids, and cellulose separately. Therefore, this analysis represents a streamlined alternative to total cell wall monosaccharide analysis.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200303/20200303001742_7095.jpg" width="122"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.
