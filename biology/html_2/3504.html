            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging aims at investigating the dynamic changes in live cells of its concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) in different pathophysiological conditions. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an ubiquitous and versatile intracellular signal that modulates a large variety of cellular functions thanks to a cell type-specific toolkit and a complex subcellular compartmentalization.<br/><br/>Many Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors are presently available (chemical and genetically encoded) that can be specifically targeted to different cellular compartments. Using these probes, it is now possible to monitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics of living cells not only in the cytosol but also within specific organelles. The choice of a specific sensor depends on the experimental design and the spatial and temporal resolution required.<br/><br/>Here we describe the use of novel FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes to dynamically and quantitatively monitor the changes in cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in a variety of cell types and experimental conditions. FRET-based sensors have the enormous advantage of being ratiometric, a feature that makes them particularly suitable for quantitative and <em>in vivo</em> applications.<br/></p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Changes in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]) regulate many intra- and inter-cellular responses (reviewed in Lu and Means, 1993; Berridge <em>et al.</em>, 2000; Orrenius <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Zampese and Pizzo, 2012). In resting conditions, cells are able to maintain a large [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] gradient between the cytosol ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>~100 nM) and the extracellular medium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]e~1.5-2 mM) thanks to the activity of a complex toolkit of antiporters and pumps (reviewed in Zampese and Pizzo, 2012). Upon different stimuli that trigger the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the intracellular stores and/or the entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular space, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> can rapidly increase up to 1-3 ÂµM. This [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> increase initiates and modulates a variety of cellular processes that operate over a wide time range, from the microsecond scale of neurotransmitter release, to the min and hours time scale of gene transcription (reviewed in Berridge <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Clapham, 2007). This signal versatility is achieved by a sophisticated cellular machinery, composed by a variety of channels, pumps, exchangers and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins localized in all cell subcompartments, that allow a precise regulation of the amplitude, duration and localization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (reviewed in Berridge <em>et al.</em>,2000; Giorgi <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>A balance between the â<em>on</em>â reactions that allow Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cytosol (from internal stores or from the extracellular milieu) and the â<em>off</em>â reactions that remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol (reviewed in Berridge <em>et al.</em>, 2003), determines the dynamics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and the specificity of the cellular response. In this contribution, we focus on changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> or in the mitochondrial matrix ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>) caused by either the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR), or by the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> across the plasma membrane (PM) through the so called âstore-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entryâ (SOCE) pathway (for a recent review, see Putney, 2017). The ER/SR is the main intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> store, where the luminal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) can reach values as high as 0.2-2 mM. The molecular actors that allow the maintenance of such a high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> are: (i) the Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases (SERCAs), responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation within the lumen (for a recent review, see Primeau <em>et al.</em>, 2018); (ii) the low-affinity high-capacity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering proteins, responsible for luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage (reviewed in Zhou <em>et al.</em>, 2013). Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER/SR depends on the presence in the organelle membranes of the ubiquitously expressed inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptors (IP3Rs; for a recent review, see Prole and Taylor, 2019) and the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) (mainly expressed in excitable cells; for a recent review, see Santulli <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Noteworthy, this Ca<sup>2+</sup> toolkit is shared by another important organelle, the Golgi Apparatus (GA) (Pinton <em>et al.</em>,1998; reviewed in Pizzo <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Subcompartments of the GA (medial- and trans-Golgi) also express another Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump, the Secretory pathway Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase pump type 1 (SPCA1, Pizzo <em>et al.</em>, 2011). Evidence has been provided in the last years suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be released also from other cell compartments (secretory granules and lysosomes) possibly though cADPR sensitive channels (for a recent review, see Morgan, 2016), although the details of this process are still debated. There is no doubt, however, that the majority of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> released during cell activation derives from the ER/SR compartment.<br/><br/>Once Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from these stores, the cation diffuses in part from the cytosol into the nucleoplasm through the nuclear pores (Brini <em>et al.</em>, 1993; Miyawaki <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Bootman <em>et al.</em>, 2000; ManjarrÃ©s <em>et al.</em>, 2008), and in part it can be transiently sequestered into the mitochondrial matrix (Rizzuto <em>et al.</em>, 1993; reviewed in Rizzuto and Pozzan, 2006; Filadi and Pozzan, 2015; Pendin <em>et al.</em>, 2015; De Stefani <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Mitochondria can take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> thanks to their large membrane potential, negative inside, and the presence in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) of the so-called Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU) Complex (MCUC). MCU is the channel forming subunit that mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, while MCUC also contains a number of recently identified regulatory proteins, such as MCUb (an inhibitory subunit), MICU1, MICU2, MICU3 and EMRE (that modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity and assembly of the complex) (for a recent review, see De Stefani <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Pallafacchina <em>et al.</em>, 2018). The efflux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the matrix back to the cytosol, depends on the H<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Jiang <em>et al.</em>, 2009) and the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (mNCX) (Palty <em>et al.</em>, 2010). Once Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases in the mitochondrial matrix, it modulates the activity of a series of enzymes involved in ATP production and, under conditions of massive accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (the so-called âCa<sup>2+</sup> overloadâ), the release of caspase cofactors and thus the initiation of the apoptosis process, and in part it can be transiently sequestered into the mitochondrial matrix (for recent reviews, see De Stefani <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Rossi <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> increases are terminated by plasma membrane (PM) extrusion mechanisms, <em>i.e.</em>, the PM Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (PMCA, reviewed in Stafford <em>et al.</em>, 2017), the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX, DiPolo and BeaugÃ©, 2006), and by Ca<sup>2+</sup> re-accumulation in the lumen of intracellular stores.<br/><br/>A unique and intensely studied process of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is the SOCE that is activated by the decrease of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]ER. The molecular mechanism of SOCE activation was clarified in the last decade and depends on: i) an ER protein called STIM1 that âsensesâ the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> and ii) a PM protein, called ORAI1, that forms Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Upon store depletion, STIM1 changes its distribution in the ER membrane, from diffused to clustered âpunctaâ that interact with the PM-located ORAI1. The formation of STIM1-ORAI1 complexes activate the channels and thus the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol (reviewed in Putney, 2018). No threshold of ER depletion are known to be necessary for SOCE activation (Hofer <em>et al.</em>, 1998). Furthermore, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx induced by SOCE is not selectively taken up by the ER, since it induces a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in both the cytosol and the mitochondria (Giacomello <em>et al.</em>, 2010). However, in the point of close proximity between ER and PM, the so-called ER and PM contact sites (reviewed in Saheki and De Camilli, 2017), the uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by the SERCA is favored.<br/><br/>Given the importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the modulation of a variety of many different cellular functions (from muscle contraction to exocytosis, from enzyme activity activation to fertilization, from gene transcription to cell death), the development of methodologies to monitor the dynamics in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in living cells has been a major topic of interest for physiologists and pathologists. A milestone in the field has been the invention by Roger Y. Tsien and co-workers of a series of intracellularly trappable indicators (reviewed in Tsien, 1981; Tsien <em>et al.</em>,1982) that are still extensively used today by hundreds of laboratories. Today, the available probes have different spectral properties and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-affinity (K<sub>d</sub>), but they were designed to stay in the cytosol and are difficult to selectively target to subcellular compartments. The development of Genetically Encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> Indicators (GECIs) revolutionized the field of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling investigation, as they allowed the targeting (using specific targeting sequences) of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors to most cell compartments with very high selectivity. The first targeted GECIs were based on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive photoprotein aequorin (Knight <em>et al.</em>, 1991) that allowed to monitor the dynamics of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in mitochondria, the ER/SR lumen, the GA, the nucleus, under the plasma membrane or within secretory granules (reviewed in Rizzuto and Pozzan 2006, Pendin <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Alonso <em>et al.</em>, 2017). Chemiluminescence by aequorin requires a prosthetic group, coelenterazine, to function. Once Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to aequorin, coelenterazine is irreversibly oxidized to coelenteramide, emitting a photon. The rate of photon emission by aequorin is proportional to the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. The major limitations of aequorin are the low amount of photon emission and the consumption of the probe during the experiment, making this tool better suited for relatively short (<em>e.g.</em>, <em>tens of</em> min) experiments in cell populations (for review see Pendin <em>et al.</em>, 2015).<br/><br/>A further improvement in the methodology for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] measurements in living cells was introduced in the late 90âs, when GECIs based on green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated (Miyawaki <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Romoser <em>et al.</em>, 1997). A further advantage of GECIs is that their expression can be placed under the control of tissue-specific or inducible promoters, controlling their expression both spatially and temporally (for review see Pendin <em>et al.</em>, 2017).<br/><br/>Mainly two types of GFP based GECIs are presently available: (i) single fluorophore-based GECIs, in which the binding domain is inserted in the sequence of the fluorescent protein (FP); (ii) FÃ¶rster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based GECIs, in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding changes the FRET efficiency between two FPs. Over time, the development of different FPs (reviewed in Rodriguez <em>et al.</em>, 2017) allowed the generation of GECIs with different colors, offering the opportunity of monitoring different subcellular compartments at the same time or of combining Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements with optogenetics (for review see Wietek and Prigge, 2016). The GECIs have been also extensively engineered to obtain sensors with different K<sub>d</sub>, dynamic range (DR, the maximum change in the fluorescence emission or ratio due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding), and kinetic properties.<br/><br/>In this contribution, we will focus on GECIs of the so-called âCameleonâ family (Figure2A) that belong to FRET-based GECIs (Palmer <em>et al.</em>, 2006). They are composed by two FPs, a cyan FP (CFP), as donor, and a yellow FP (YFP or its variants citrine and cpV), as acceptor. The two FPs are connected by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing peptide, calmodulin (CaM) that can bind four Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, and the CaM-binding peptide of the myosin light chain kinase M13 (M13) (Miyawaki <em>et al.</em>, 1997) that are in turn separated by a short glycine-glycine linker. When Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to CaM, a reversible conformational change occurs in CaM that wraps around M13; modifying the distance between the two FPs and thus FRET efficiency between the FPs (Figure 2A). In practical terms: i) the cells expressing the probe are illuminated with a light wavelength that excites the donor FP only; ii) the light emitted by the donor and acceptor FPs is monitored and the ratio between the donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities (emission ratio, R) is calculated; iii) an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] augments the energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor FP (the donor fluorescence decreases whereas that of the acceptor increases). Thus, changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] can be conveniently monitored as changes in R. Cameleons are the first GFP- and FRET-based GECIs developed and are still among the most commonly used.<br/><br/>Over the last two decades, Cameleons have been widely used and their cDNA sequence has been extensively modified to target it to different organelles, to reduce interference with endogenous CaM, to ameliorate the DR, to tune the K<sub>d</sub>, and to improve signal/noise ratio (SNR) (Truong <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Nagai <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Evanko and Haydon, 2005; Palmer <em>et al.</em>, 2006; Horikawa <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Greotti <em>et al.</em>, 2019). A red-shifted mitochondrial targeted Cameleon has been also generated (Waldeck-Weiermair <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Among the different types of Cameleons, the D1, D2, D3 and D4 variants are the more extensively used. They have a circularly permuted Venus (cpV) as acceptor that improves the ratiometric sensitivity (Nagai <em>et al.</em>, 2004), CaM and M13 have been mutated to lower interference with the endogenous protein (Palmer <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Recently, also the donor has been changed improving the SNR and lowering the pH sensitivity of these sensors (Greotti <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/>Generally, this ratiometric measurement has the enormous advantages of making FRET-based GECIs independent from changes in the focal plane, of heterogeneity in probe loading/expression, or leakage and of artifacts introduced by sample movements. Thus, the affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> of Cameleons, as other FRET-based probes, can be more easily estimated not only <em>in vitro</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, employing the purified protein, but also <em>in situ</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, in living cells. Indeed, the <em>in situ</em>-K<sub>d</sub> of Cameleons targeted to different subcellular compartments are available (Palmer and Tsien, 2006; Drago <em>et al.</em>, 2008; Giacomello <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Lissandron <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Wong <em>et al.</em>, 2013; Greotti <em>et al.</em>, 2016 and 2019), allowing the conversion of R into [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Other variants of Cameleons are TN-L15, TN-humTnC (Heim and Griesbeck, 2004; Mank <em>et al.</em>, 2006) and Twitch (Thestrup <em>et al.</em>, 2014), in which the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responsive element (CaM) has been replaced with chicken skeletal muscle Troponin C (TnC), human cardiac TnC or Opsanus TnC, respectively. Generally, FRET-based sensors are recommended for <em>in vivo</em> experiments or for experimental models that undergo substantial movement during measurements (<em>e.g.</em>, cardiomyocytes).<br/><br/>As mentioned, there is another class of GECIs based on a single FP. These sensors are best suited for multiple-organelle imaging and they generally have a larger DR, compared to FRET-based GECIs. Different types of single fluorophore GECIs have been created in the last years. The first generated single FP probes are Camgaroos (Griesbeck <em>et al.</em>, 2001) and the Pericam family (flash Pericam, inverse Pericam, and ratiometric Pericam, mitochondria-targeted Pericam; Nagai <em>et al.</em>, 2001: Filippin <em>et al.</em>, 2005). Nowadays, the most popular among single FP-based sensors are the GCaMPs family and organelle-entrapped protein indicators (CEPIA). These sensors are obtained fusing M13 and CaM to the N- and C-terminus respectively of a circularly permuted EGFP (Nakai <em>et al.</em>, 2001). Also for these sensors, many variants with different K<sub>d</sub>s and DR are available and some of them have been targeted to ER (Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2014; de Juan-Sanz <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Henderson <em>et al.</em>, 2015) and mitochondria (Patron <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Wu <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Mammucari <em>et al.</em>, 2015). A large DR characterizes CEPIA and GCaMPs, though they are strongly pH sensitive and GCaMPs have low fluorescence at resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels <em>in vivo</em>. CEPIA sensors are especially useful for simultaneous measurement of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in mitochondria, ER and cytosolic compartments, since sensors with very different emission wavelengths (and targeted to different organelles) have been generated. Recently, also the CaMP family have been engineered to obtain multicolored XCaMPs (Inoue <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Of note, GCaMP6 (Chen <em>et al.</em>, 2013) and ratiometric pericams can be used in the ratiometric mode exploiting the isosbestic point of their excitation spectra (Nagai <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Filippin <em>et al.</em>, 2005; Hill <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Patron <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Unfortunately, this characteristic is not practically usable in confocal microscopes (single or multiphoton). A FRET-based variant of CEPIA, called GEM-CEPIA, has been also recently generated (Suzuki <em>et al.</em>, 2014).<br/><br/>A recent interesting innovation in GECIs is the generation of probes with photoactivable (PAFPs) or photoswitchable FPs (PSFPs). These FPs change their spectral properties in response to a specific wavelength irradiation (reviewed in Rodriguez <em>et al.</em>, 2017). PSFPs and PAFPs allow the activation/conversion of a small subset of molecules, providing a tool to perform super-resolved Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Examples of these sensors are a FRET-based GECIs, named PA-TNXL (Matsuda <em>et al.</em>, 2013) and a âCa<sup>2+</sup> integratorâ named âCaMPARIâ. The latter is a non-conventional GECI, since it undergoes an irreversible green to red conversion when UV light is irradiated in the presence of an elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>, allowing the identification of cells that experienced increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> <em>in vivo</em> (Fosque <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Moeyaert <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>Last but not least, recently, two new sensors based on Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) have been developed. BRET-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors consist of a bioluminescent molecule that transfer its excited state due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to the acceptor (typically a YFP) when the two moieties are sufficiently close to allow the resonant transfer of energy. Compared to FRET, BRET sensors do not require donor excitation by an external light source. These probes contain a chimeric GFP-aequorin protein (GAP) (Rodriguez-Garcia <em>et al.</em>, 2014) linked to an optimized luciferase reporter, namely Nano-lantern (Suzuki <em>et al.</em>, 2016). Although both photoswitchable/photoactivable FP probes and the BRET-based GECI have quite interesting characteristics, their use is still rather limited.<br/><br/>In this contribution, we focus on new Cameleons targeted to mitochondria and the cytosol with improved characteristics (<em>i.e.</em>, increased SNR and decreased pH sensitivity, thanks to the donor substitution), and we describe a few typical protocols in which these probes are used to monitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx due to SOCE or the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from ER through IP<sub>3</sub>R/RyR stimulation.<br/></p>

The speed and the resistance exerted on the tubes should be adjusted to guarantee a 2-3 ml/min of flow and to prevent the cells from drying. To maintain the temperature and avoid focal drift, a thermal stage, connected to the dual channel temperature controller, is used to adapt the open-top chamber. Finally, an objective heater can be used to avoid focal drift, if necessary.

Thus, treat cells with SERCA pump inhibitors at least for 7 min in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free, EGTA (600 Î¼M)-containing extracellular medium. This step will deplete the store, allowing STIM1 puncta formation and their translocation to the PM, where ORAI1 is located.

For the experiments described in this protocol, the acquisition rate is 0.5-1 Hz; however, to avoid unnecessary photobleaching, the recording rate of this step can be slowed down to one image every 20-30 s.</li><li>Since the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is strongly affected by differences in PM potential, altering the rate and the extent of SOCE (Penner <em>et al.</em>, 1993), the evaluation of PM-potential-independent SOCE, requires the substitution the extracellular medium with a K<sup>+</sup>-based medium (where NaCl is iso-osmotically substituted by KCl; see Recipes for details). In these conditions, the PM potential collapses, nullifying differences of PM potential among cells. Clearly this latter protocol can be used in cells devoid of Voltage Gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> Channels because, if they were expressed, they cause a major, SOCE independent, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.<br/>  To trigger influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from PM independent from PM potential (<em>i.e.</em>, SOCE activation), the intracellular stores must be emptied using CPA or TG, as explained before. Thus, treat cells with SERCA pump inhibitors at least for 7 min in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free, EGTA (600 Î¼M)-containing K<sup>+</sup>-based medium saline.

Indeed, since also the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> decreased when a K<sup>+</sup>-based medium is used, the extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] used to visualize SOCE must be doubled in respect to the classical SOCE activation protocol (from 1.5 to 3 mM).

The IP<sub>3</sub> generated mediates the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, decreasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the ER and thus causing transient [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increase in cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. Different drugs can be used to elicit IP<sub>3</sub>Rs activation depending on cell type. For HeLa cells, we use histamine at a final concentration of 10-100 ÂµM (Figures 3A-3F) that is perfused in the extracellular medium containing EGTA, 1 minute after the perfusion of the same medium without the agonist. The usage of 100 ÂµM of histamine ensures the maximal stimulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R.

This protocol is also useful when a comparison between GECIs with different biophysical properties (<em>i.e.</em>, different K<sub>d</sub> and DR) is performed. For this part of the protocol, two different approaches can be used.<br/><br/></li></ol><p class="ppzzs"><strong><em>Digitonin-based protocol:</em></strong> </p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>The best one consists of cell permeabilization with digitonin in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free intracellular-like medium (Figures 3A-3F).

Of note, for mitochondrial probe calibration, FCCP should be added in each solution of the calibration step. This drug is a mitochondrial uncoupler that, collapsing mitochondrial membrane potential, allows the equilibration of extra-mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] with that in the matrix.

Thus, load cells with a cytosolic chemical probe, </em><em>e.g.</em><em>, Fluo-4 (see Figure 4), and transfect cells with the desired Cameleon.

To correct for photobleaching, multiply the intensity of the channel by a correction factor, calculated dividing the intensity of the FP at the beginning of the experiment by the FP intensity at a given time point (Zal </em><em>et al.</em><em>, 2004).</em> </li><li>Using Origin Software, it is possible to calculate (Figure 5):<br/><ol class="npwfour"><li>The area under the curve (AUC) by exploiting the plugin âintegrateâ (for integral measurement) taking into consideration only the part of the curve that defines the rise of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], to estimate Ca<sup>2+</sup> content (Figures 5A-5B);</li><li>The uptake rate by applying the plugin âdifferentiateâ for derivative calculation (Figure 5C);</li><li>The efflux rate by applying the plugin âfit exponentialâ (Figure 5D).<br/></li></ol><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200119/20200119002232_4977.jpg" width="149"/><br/><strong>Figure 5.
