            <h1>Steady-state and Flux-based Trehalose Estimation as an Indicator of Carbon  Flow from Gluconeogenesis or Glycolysis</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Ritu  Gupta, Sunil   Laxman</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Trehalose (and glycogen) is a major storage carbohydrate in many cells, including <em>S. cerevisiae</em>. Typically, trehalose (a disaccharide of glucose) is synthesized and stored through gluconeogenesis. However, trehalose can also be made directly from glucose, if glucose-6-phosphate is channeled away from glycolysis or pentose phosphate pathway. Therefore, analyzing trehalose synthesis, utilization or its accumulation, can be used as a sentinel read-out for either gluconeogenesis or rewired glucose utilization. However, the steady-state measurements alone of trehalose cannot unambiguously distinguish the nature of carbon flux in a system. Here, we first summarize simple steady-state enzymatic assays to measure trehalose (and glycogen), that will have very wide uses. Subsequently, we describe methods of highly sensitive, quantitative LC-MS/MS based to measure trehalose. We include methods of <sup>13</sup>C stable-isotope based pulse-labeling experiments (using different carbon sources) with which to measure rates of trehalose synthesis, from different carbon metabolism pathways. This approach can be used to unambiguously determine the extent of carbon flux into trehalose coming from gluconeogenesis, or directly from glucose/glycolysis. These protocols collectively enable comprehensive steady-state as well as carbon flux based measurements of trehalose. This permits a dissection of carbon flux to distinguish between cells in a gluconeogenic state (conventionally leading to trehalose synthesis), or cells with rewired glucose metabolism (also leading to trehalose synthesis). While the methods presented are optimized for yeast, these methods can be easily adapted to several types of cells, including many microbes.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Carbon flux estimates are excellent indicators of overall cellular metabolic states (Metallo and Vander Heiden, 2013; Antoniewicz, 2018; Jang <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Typically, glucose consumption towards high glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway reflect a âgrowthâ metabolic state, and will lead to high nucleotide synthesis and energy production. Alternately, high rates of gluconeogenesis from alternate carbon sources, which lead to the formation of the storage carbohydrates trehalose and glycogen, indicate a âstarvation-likeâ metabolic state. To easily identify cell states, estimates of carbon flux into trehalose, when properly used, can distinguish between high gluconeogenic states or simply rewired glucose metabolism due to other causes, as described below.<br/><br/>Trehalose has been best studied as a major storage sugar in a range of organisms, ranging from yeast, nematodes, flies, plants and more (Elbein <em>et al.</em>, 2003; Iturriaga <em>et al.</em>, 2009). Functionally, trehalose has multiple roles in survival and desiccation tolerance (Lillie and Pringle, 1980; Behm, 1997; Erkut <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Iordachescu and Imai, 2011; Tapia and Koshland, 2014). Also trehalose consumption enables cells to exit from quiescence (Shi <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Dhawan and Laxman, 2015; Laporte <em>et al.</em>, 2017). High amounts of trehalose accumulation in cells is a metabolic signature for cells in a âquiescence-likeâ state (Gray <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Erkut <em>et al.</em>, 2011; De Virgilio, 2012). Conventionally, trehalose is primarily made in cells during glucose limitation, when there is very high gluconeogenic flux from alternate carbon sources. This is illustrated in Figure 1. However, trehalose is also produced during glycolysis when glucose is consumed in a constant âfutileâ cycle in order to balance glycolysis (Van Heerden <em>et al.</em>, 2014) (Figure 1). In this case, trehalose does not accumulate, and glucose-6-phosphate is largely channeled into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and glycolysis. However, if a rewiring of either the PPP and/or the lower arm of glycolysis occurs, this can result in greater flux into trehalose synthesis and accumulation (Figure 1). This second mode of trehalose synthesis, which can occur due to different (and sometimes distant) causes, all of which will reflect a âstarvation-stateâ, is far less appreciated. In recent studies, we observed such a rewiring of carbon metabolism in specific tRNA modification mutants, resulting in such a âstarvation-stateâ (Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Notably, carbon flux from glucose into trehalose was a key read-out used to establish and characterize these metabolic states (Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2019). In this context, a limitation in free (inorganic) phosphate controlled this metabolic rewiring. Here, glucose-6-phosphate (from glucose) was routed towards trehalose synthesis, since trehalose synthesis also releases phosphates (Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2019).<br/><br/><p class="ppzz" style="margin-left:30px;"><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191229/20191229230136_8426.jpg" width="350"/><br/><strong>Figure 1. Trehalose synthesis is made either from glucose during glycolysis (in a futile cycle), or as an end product of gluconeogenesis.</strong> The green arrows indicate gluconeogenic flux (which can come from oxaloacetate (OAA), aspartate or other gluconeogenic carbon sources), while the red arrows indicate carbon flux during glycolysis (coming from glucose).<br/><p class="ppzz"><br/>Using the protocols described in this manuscript to measure steady-state trehalose concentrations, we had noted that such an approach was insufficient to establish a gluconeogenic state (Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2019). However, by using different <sup>13</sup>C stable-isotope based approaches (described below), we could measure flux into trehalose, and determine whether trehalose is being made via to gluconeogenesis, or from altered glycolysis (Figure 1). Here, by using labeled glucose, we can determine carbon flux into trehalose directly from glucose (Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2019). Using alternate <sup>13</sup>C-labeled carbon sources (primarily aspartate), we can unambiguously estimate trehalose synthesized due to gluconeogenesis (or alternately distinguish this from trehalose made directly from glucose). This combined use of steady-state and <sup>13</sup>C-labeled carbon-flux measurements of trehalose is therefore extremely powerful as an analytical approach. This can quantitatively and qualitatively distinguish metabolic states of cells, and indicate the nature of the carbon flux outputs. While the protocols described here were optimized in yeast, they are easily adaptable to almost any cellular system (of suspension or adherent cells), and so have broad uses, particularly in microbial systems. We also note that this approach towards estimating only flux towards trehalose is complementary to, and also simpler and more comprehensive than other methods for analysis of carbon flux, described in other studies (Walvekar <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Gupta <em>et al.</em>, 2019). We collectively present a range of methods to unambiguously, quantitatively estimate trehalose amounts, as well as carbon flux into trehalose, all of which can be used to establish overall carbon metabolism and metabolic states in cells.<br/></p></p></p>
