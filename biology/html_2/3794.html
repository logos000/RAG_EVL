            <h1>Real-time Three-dimensional Tracking of Endocytic Vesicles</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Stephanie Duhamel, Kossay Zaoui</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Endocytic trafficking and recycling are fundamental cellular processes that control essential functions such as signaling protein complexes transport and membrane identity. The small GTPase Rabs are indispensable component of the endosomal recycling machinery. The Rabs bind to effectors to mediate their functions, such as protein sorting and degradation, membrane tethering or lipid modification, and organelle motility. Due to the complex and dynamic nature of endosomal compartments and tracking route, detailed multiparametric analyses of three-dimensional data by quantitative methods are challenging. Here, we describe a detailed time-lapse imaging protocol designed for the quantitative tracking of single endosomal vesicles, using GFP-Rab4-positive recycling endosomes. This method permits automated tracking of single endocytic vesicles in three-dimensional live cell imaging, allowing the study of multiple parameters such as abundance, speed, directionality, and subcellular localization, as well as protein colocalization. This protocol can be broadly used in any kind of cellular models, under various contexts, including growth factors stimulation, gene knockdowns, drug treatments, and is suitable for high throughput screens.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Accumulating evidence emphasizes the importance of coordinated endosomal recycling in such diverse processes as cell migration, adhesion, morphogenesis, proliferation, cytokinesis, as well as learning and memory (Grant and Donaldson, 2009; Parachoniak and Park, 2012; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014; Zaoui <em>et al.</em>, 2019a and 2019b). There are over 70 Rab GTPases in mammals that have distinct localizations and functions in membrane trafficking. Further compounding complexity, while most Rab GTPases are ubiquitous, some display tissue specificity expression (van der Sluijs <em>et al.</em>, 1992; McCaffrey <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Grant and Donaldson, 2009; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014). Among them, the small GTPase Rab4, localized in the early endosome, regulates the trafficking along the endocytic route, from early and recycling endosomes, toward the plasma membrane. Rab4 has been involved in the recycling of receptors such as Tfn and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), integrins, ubiquitin ligases, as well as other machinery regulators associated with vesicle formation, budding, transport, and fusion (McCaffrey <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Grant and Donaldson, 2009; Stenmark, 2009; Parachoniak <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014; Zaoui <em>et al.</em>, 2019a). We recently reported strict requirement of the MT plus-end tracking proteins CLIP-170 for Rab4-mediated Met RTK recycling at the plasma membrane in response to its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The increased localization of Met/Rab4 vesicles towards the MT plus-ends in response to HGF results in enhanced cell protrusion dynamic and cell migration (Zaoui <em>et al.</em>, 2019a).<br/> <br/>Therefore, by mediating the compartmentalization of the endocytic pathway into early, recycling, late, and lysosomal tracking routes and by regulating the trafficking from vesicle budding to fusion, Rabs stand as essential integrators of cell signaling. Rabs control the localization, the intensity, and the duration of signaling outputs, to allow spatiotemporal regulation of signal transduction (McCaffrey <em>et al.</em>, 2001; Stenmark, 2009; Grant and Donaldson, 2009; Parachoniak and Park, 2012; Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014; Zaoui <em>et al.</em>, 2019a). Altered endocytosis is observed in many malignancies and can lead to sustained proliferation, survival, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance (Parachoniak and Park, 2012; Mellman and Yarden, 2013; Zaoui <em>et al.</em>, 2019a and 2019b). Our studies aim at understanding endocytic recycling alterations on cell signaling regulating cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell migration, and invasion in oncogenic contexts.<br/> <br/>The protocol described herein permits automated tracking of the endocytic vesicle in three-dimensional live-cell imaging, allowing the study and the quantification of multiple parameters under physiological and tumorigenic conditions. Moreover, this methodology can be easily extended to assess the mobility of other Rab family members or any other cell vesicles.</p>
