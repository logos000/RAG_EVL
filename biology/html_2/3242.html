            <h1>Simultaneous Fluorescent Recordings of Extracellular ATP and Intracellular Calcium in Mammalian Cells</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Nicholas Mikolajewicz, Svetlana V. Komarova</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Extracellular ATP is a potent signaling molecule that stimulates intracellular calcium responses through purinergic (P2) receptors in mammalian cells. While extracellular ATP and intracellular calcium can be measured separately, simultaneous monitoring can offer additional insights into P2 receptor physiology. This protocol takes advantage of the overlapping fluorescence spectra between the ATP-detection substrate luciferin and calcium indicator dye Fura2. Mammalian cells are loaded with Fura2-AM and live-cell recordings are acquired in the presence of a luciferin-luciferase imaging solution. This protocol allows to study stimulus-induced ATP release and directly relate changes in extracellular ATP concentration to observed calcium responses.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>ATP is a potent extracellular signaling molecule that is released in response to a variety of stress-related stimuli, including mechanical stimulation or injury (Mikolajewicz <em>et al.</em>, 2018a). Extracellular ATP is an autocrine and paracrine signal that acts through a number of purinergic (P2) receptors, which consist of two sub-families, P2X and P2Y receptors, and are omnipresent in virtually all mammalian cells (Burnstock and Verkhratsky, 2009). P2X receptors consist of 7 subtypes (P2X<sub>1-7</sub>) of ligand-gated cation channels that permit calcium influx upon stimulation. P2Y receptors include 8 subtypes of G-protein coupled receptors (P2Y<sub>1-2, 4, 6, 11-14</sub>), several which can induce release of calcium from intracellular calcium stores through inositol triphosphate.<br/><br/>The luciferin-luciferase bioluminescence assay is the gold standard for measuring ATP concentrations (Seminario-Vidal <em>et al.</em>, 2009). In the presence of ATP, luciferase oxidizes luciferin and produces bioluminescent light proportionally to the amount of ATP present (Table1). While sensitive and robust, bioluminescence method is difficult to employ in microscopy applications and requires specialized equipment due to the low signal intensity. Luciferin is also a cell-impermeable fluorescent molecule, a property that was originally explored by Sorensen and Novak (2001) to develop a fluorescence method to measure extracellular ATP. This method is compatible with standard fluorescence microscopy and relies on the detection of a decrease in luciferin fluorescence emission intensity when it is depleted in the presence of ATP (Table 1).<br/><br/><strong>Table 1. Bioluminescence and fluorescence properties of luciferin-luciferase reaction.</strong> In the presence of ATP, luciferin is oxidized by luciferase to generate oxyluciferin thereby resulting in production of bioluminescence and loss of fluorescence proportional to the concentration of ATP.<br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190515/20190515005251_5559.png" width="650"/><br/><br/>Calcium indicator dyes are used to monitor changes in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in live cells (Paredes <em>et al.</em>, 2008). While there is a wide selection of indicator dyes with varying properties (<em>e.g.,</em> affinity, brightness, spectral range), Fura2-acetoxymethyl ester (Fura2-AM) is among the most commonly used (Grynkiewicz <em>et al.</em>, 1985). When added to a cell culture, Fura2-AM accumulates intracellularly, where the acetoxymethyl ester group is removed by cellular esterases, producing an active dye entrapped within the cell. Fura2 is a ratiometric dye that changes its excitation spectrum upon binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. When Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound Fura2 is excited at 340 nm, emission at ~510 nm is proportional to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Conversely, when Ca<sup>2+</sup>-unbound Fura2 is excited at 380 nm, emission at ~510 nm is inversely proportional to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Thus, measuring fluorescence at a single emission of 510 nm, with alternating excitation with 340 and 380 nm, provides a ratiometric measure of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that is independent of dye loading and environmental artifacts.<br/><br/>Since the excitation and emission spectra of luciferin overlap with Fura2 (Figure 1), and the dyes are compartmentalized in the extracellular (luciferin) and intracellular (Fura2) spaces, this overlap in fluorescence spectra can be used to simultaneously measure extracellular ATP concentrations and changes in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, as reported in our prior work (Mikolajewicz <em>et al.</em>, 2018b) and presented in detail below.<br/><br/><img alt="" class="layerphoto" height="100" loading="lazy" src="https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190515/20190515005433_3737.jpg" width="196"/><br/><strong>Figure 1.
