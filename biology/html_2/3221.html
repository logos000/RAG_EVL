            <h1>Optimized Oxidative Stress Protocols for Low-microliter Volumes of Mammalian Plasma</h1>
            <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Evan A. Langille</p>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Small blood volumes commonly obtained from small mammals during field studies are only sufficient for a single biochemical assay. In this study, we used blood collected from a population of wild eastern chipmunks (<em>Tamias striatus</em>) and developed modified methods to improve analytical selectivity and sensitivity required for measuring markers of oxidative stress using small blood volumes. Specifically, we proposed a modified malondialdehyde (MDA) analysis protocol by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and also optimized both the uric acid independent ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and hypochlorous acid shock capacity (HASC) assays. We present methods in which a total volume of less than 60 Î¼l of plasma is required to obtain a comprehensive portrait of an individualâs oxidative profile.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2><p>Measuring markers of oxidative stress has become increasingly popular and useful for the evaluation of individualâs physiological status. Measuring multiple oxidative stress markers and estimating methodological precision usually requires large blood sample volumes, making it difficult for researchers to perform comprehensive analyses of oxidative stress profile of small wild animals. We present in-house assays optimized to yield the most selective analysis for each marker using the smallest blood volumes possible (Langille <em>et al.</em>, 2018).<br/><br/>MDA is a product of lipid peroxidation that in recent years has been measured by HPLC (Nussey <em>et al.</em>, 2009). We present an HPLC method employing UV detection that uses a low volume of plasma to obtain a sensitivity and detection range appropriate for oxidative stress studies.<br/><br/>The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay has been extensively used in various disciplines ranging from agronomy and nutrition (Carlsen <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Di Silvestro <em>et al.</em>, 2017) to ecological studies (Griffin and Bhagooli, 2004; Ruykys <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Eikenaar <em>et al.</em>, 2018). Antioxidants in the samples reduce the ferric-tripyridyltriazine (Fe<sup>3+</sup>-TPTZ) complex to ferrous tripyridyltriazine (Fe<sup>2+</sup>-TPTZ), producing a blue color. The coloration intensity is proportional to the reducing capacity of the mostly non-enzymatic antioxidants in the plasma, hence providing the overall antioxidant capacity. Uric acid has been shown to interfere with the result of this assay however, Duplancic <em>et al.</em> (2011) proposed removing the uric acid using uricase with larger volume sample. We optimized the amount of uricase and sample needed to successfully remove all uric acid from a smaller sample, therefore improving the efficiency and accuracy of the test.<br/><br/>The HASC assay is commonly referred to by its kit named OXY-Adsorbent Test<sup>TM</sup> from Diacron International (Grosseto, Italy). In this test, an excess of hypochlorous acid, a strong oxidant, is added and incubated with a plasma sample. The hypochlorous acid oxidizes any reduced components in the plasma, then a chromogenic dye is added to quantify the remaining hypochlorous acid. Although the test was already optimized for 10 Âµl, the relatively high cost of each plate made it difficult for researchers to utilize this kit in large studies. We reduced the required volume to 1 Âµl and provide an in-house protocol to prepare the reagents and execute the test.</p>

An application had to be filed through Health Canada to obtain authorization to procure 2-thiobarbituric acid. In the USA, 2-thiobarbituric acid is not controlled and can be purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.</li><li>It is important to note that micropipettes are used throughout this experiment and therefore investigators should be trained in good pipetting technique and be comfortable with the pipettes. It is crucial to practice good technique as very small volumes of solution are handled and therefore any error can be magnified if the pipette is not delivering an accurate volume. </li><li>All solutions should be prepared using good analytical techniques. If you plan to process a large number of samples for a single study, it is advisable to prepare the stocks once for that study to minimize variability between several preparations of the same solution. </li><li>The linear range of each UV detector or microplate reader can change depending on the model, age <em>etc</em>. It is important to check that the system provides a linear calibration before processing plasma samples. </li><li>The figures of merit to assess the performance of the method were calculated in the following ways: relative standard deviation (%RSD) is the standard deviation divided by the mean of three separate preparations (and three injections per preparation) of the same sample. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were calculated by measuring the noise of a blank injection. The LOD and LOQ are defined as 3 and 10 times the noise level of the blank, respectively. </li><li>The linearity of the MDA calibration curve from 1.25-20 Î¼M was high using this method (%RSD = 0.32, n = 7). The LOD and LOQ were 0.06 and 0.125 Î¼M respectively. The inter-assay variation (%RSD = 9.31, n = 48) was representative of the laboratory measurement error. We obtained no significant increase for QC samples over time (Î² = 0.0195 Î¼M per hour, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.017, n = 8). The QC quantifications compared to the mean of all the individuals assessed in each day revealed that there is little effect on the results from different days of analysis (slope = 0.99, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.98, n = 9). Example chromatograms are shown in Langille <em>et al.</em>, 2018. </li><li>For the developed uric acid independent FRAP assay, the linearity of the calibration curve, from 0.5-3 mM FeSO<sub>4</sub>, was high (%RSD = 2.50, n = 7). The inter-assay variation (%RSD) was 5.82 (n = 57). </li><li>The linearity of the calibration curve for the adapted HASC assay, ranging from 0.03-0.5 mM HClO, was high (%RSD = 3.64, n = 4). The inter-assay variation (%RSD) was 2.03 (n = 32). </li><li>If you are using a monochromator-based spectrophotometer or microplate reader, you can simply use the wavelengths suggested in this paper for measurement. <br/></li></ol><p class="pptt" id="biaoti27558">### Recipes</p><ol class="npwtwok"><li>0.1 M butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) solution<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 2.20 g butylated hydroxytoluene in 100 ml anhydrous ethanol</li><li>The solution may require brief sonication to aid in rapid dissolution</li><li>Storage: RT, Shelf life: 3 months</li></ol></li><li>15% trichloroacetic acid solution<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>In a fume hood, add 15 ml 6.1 N (100% w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution slowly to 85 ml ultrapure water</li><li>Briefly vortex to mix</li><li>Storage: RT, Shelf life: 3 months<br/></li></ol></li><li>2 N NaOH solution<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 8 g NaOH pellets in 100 ml ultrapure water</li><li>Stir with a magnetic stir plate until the pellets completely dissolve</li><li>Storage: RT, Shelf life: 3 months</li></ol></li><li>2-thiobarbituric acid solution<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>Dissolve 0.375 g 2-thiobarbituric acid in 100 ml 0.25 M HCl</li><li>Heat in a water bath at 50 Â°C for 10 min, then sonicate for 5 min to aid in rapid dissolution</li><li>Storage: 4 Â°C, Shelf life: 3 months<br/></li></ol></li><li>0.25 M HCl solution<br/><ol class="npwthree"><li>In a fume hood, slowly add 10.4 ml 12 M (conc.)
