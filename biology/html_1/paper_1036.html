These specimens can be used for proteomic analysis to analyze proteome composition. A critical step in these proteomic analyses is the extraction of proteins from fresh frozen samples, which can affect the sampling of the proteomes. Here, we compare three different methods for protein extraction from fresh frozen mouse heart tissue: 1) extraction using SDS buffer followed by FASP purification, 2) extraction using SDS buffer followed by S-Trap purification, and 3) extraction using a guanidine hydrochloride buffer followed by in-solution digestion. Based on bicinchoninic acid assay, all three methods display similar recovery of total protein content. However, proteomics-based analysis identified far fewer proteins from the extraction guanidine hydrochloride. SDS-FASP identifies as many proteins as the SDS-STrap method with good coverage of proteins from different cellular compartments.</p><br>Keywords: Proteomics, Tissue, Mass Spectrometry, Protein Extraction, Fresh Frozen<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>	Human and patient tissue banks routinely keep fresh frozen tissue samples which can be further examined and investigated. Different extraction buffers and different purification methods have been proposed to maximize protein recovery and identification from fresh frozen tissue. Here, we present three different methods for protein extraction from fresh frozen mouse tissue, evaluating both the protein recovery and the protein identification by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomics. The three methods are: 1) SDS-FASP (filter-aided sample preparation). Extraction with a 2% SDS buffer and purification by FASP.<sup>1</sup> 2) SDS-STrap. Extraction with a 5% SDS buffer and purification by S-Trap. 3) GH-IS. Extraction with a 6M guanidine hydrochloride extraction buffer with in-solution digestion.&nbsp;</p><p>	We chose to study mouse heart tissue because it is composed both of cells and connective tissue and can serve as a model for multiple tissues, in which connective proteins may impede protein extraction from cells. We compared a detergent based buffer (SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate) and a chaotropic agent containing buffer (GH, guanidine hydrochloride) for protein extraction. Detergents lyse cells by forming micelles and disrupting membranes, thus releasing contents within cellular organelles. Chaotropic agents, such as guanidine hydrochloride, tend to lyse cells by disrupting hydrogen bonding of water molecules and ionic interactions. We also compared different purification methods, by S-Trap (Protifi), FASP and by in-solution digestion. Presence of detergents used in the extraction process and of polymers will greatly reduce the sensitivity and accuracy of mass spectrometry proteomics. Here, the comparison of two different spin column-based methods of purification against an in-solution digestion method will allow determination the effect of sample purification on mass spectrometry protein identification. In addition, strong cation exchange (SCX) pre-fractionation of peptides before LC-MS proteomics further enhances the number of identified proteins in both the SDS-FASP and SDS-STrap methods.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>Vivacon 500 30,000 MWCO.

Based on tissue wet weight and the amount of protein extracted as measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, we observed similar recovery efficiencies between protein extraction using SDS- GH-containing buffers, with 9.8%, 8.1% and 9.3% recovery efficiencies for 5%SDS, 2%SDS and GH buffers, respectively (Table 1). This suggests that both detergent and chaotropic agents can extract proteins from heart tissue at a relatively high efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the extracted proteins are subject to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, we however see a marked decrease in protein identifications from the GH-IS method, with 1091 unique proteins identified from single dimension separation (Fig 1A). The SDS-FASP and SDS-STrap methods identified 1858 and 1596 unique proteins (Fig 1A). A majority of proteins, 926 of 2067 unique proteins, were identified from all 3 methods, while SDS-FASP method identified 342 proteins not identified in other methods while SDS-STrap identified 148 proteins not identified in other methods.</p><p>	The composition of these proteins based on gene ontology are mainly intracellular proteins comprising more than 90% of identified proteins (Fig 1B), while extracellular matrix proteins comprised between 4-6% of identified proteins. Notably, cell junction proteins were highly enriched from the protein extracts at 19-21% of identified proteins. Proteins from many cellular compartments were well represented and recovered, including the cytoplasm (86-89%), nucleus (37-40%), mitochondrion (33-39%), ribosome (6-9%), endoplasmic reticulum (11-13%) and plasma membrane proteins (7-8%).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peptides extracted by SDS-FASP and SDS-STrap methods were subjected to offline strong cation exchange fractionation followed by LC-MS analysis. The use of 2<sup>nd</sup> dimension fractionation over 6 fractions increased the number of unique proteins identified to 3224 and 3026 for SDS-FASP and SDS-Strap methods, respectively (Fig 1C). We observed comparable representation of proteins from different cellular compartments (Fig 1D) between the SDS-FASP and SDS-Strap method including the cytoplasm (73-74%), nucleus (32%), mitochondrion (26%), ribosome (5%), endoplasmic reticulum (12%) and plasma membrane proteins (6%). </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comparisons between the three different methods suggest that SDS-containing extraction buffers have a recovery efficiency comparable to GH containing extraction buffers. The use of FASP or S-Trap purification has minimal effect on the number of identified proteins and the use of 2-dimensional separation greatly increases protein coverage. The comparison of the different protein extraction methods will help us better understand how to approach analysis of fresh frozen tissues for clinical proteomics.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium<sup>11</sup> via the PRIDE<sup>12</sup> partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD020256.</p><h2>References</h2><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wisniewski, J.
