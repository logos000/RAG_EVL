All patients over the age of 15 from 5 types of cancer, acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast and colon cancer will enter the study. Patients are randomly assigned to two groups. During two months of treatment, the two groups are treated with either hydroxychloroquine or placebo. Patients will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms. The primary end point of the study is to investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in patients.</p><p>Randomisation will be performed using randomly permuted blocks. The allocation ratio in two groups is 1:1. Participants, caregivers, outcome assessor and the data analyst are blinded to group assignment.</p><p>The calculated total sample size is 60 patients, with 30 patients in each group. The trial began on April 14, 2020 and recruitment is ongoing. Recruitment is anticipated to be completed by June 14, 2020. This trial has been registered on<em> the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials</em> (<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__en.irct.ir_trial_46946&amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;c=vh6FgFnduejNhPPD0fl_yRaSfZy8CWbWnIf4XJhSqx8&amp;r=yGsNwwIyJd3xKHVU9_4LLKlAbZ6SJFHHvIYe8xGuag8&amp;m=LkPkblZZAhERdCCp0fqvPwJl3mjRvresLBpTA0OyqTg&amp;s=FJWt_FoAbwKzCprPDlqioBKLkbZwI-NLNF6-CrwKuhg&amp;e=" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRCT</a>) with the registration number of IRCT20200405046958N1.</p><br>Keywords: COVID-19, Randomised controlled trial, protocol, Hydroxychloroquine, Acute Lymphoid Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Breast cancer, Colon cancer, Prophylaxis<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The new COVID-19 disease and its rapid spread have caused much concern in the community.</p><p>The unknown nature of the virus and the limited capabilities of the medical staff on the one hand and the higher susceptibility of cancer patients to this viral disease and higher mortality rate on the other hand have caused fear among physicians and cancer patients about continuing cancer treatment in the current situation.</p><p>Delayed treatment can in many cases lead to the progression of cancer and make the treatable disease incurable, or increase the side effects, and in some cases lead to death.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>Hydroxychloroquine tablet (AminÂ® Pharmaceutical Company, Isfahan, Iran) and placebo (identical in terms of shape, color, smell and taste)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Not applicable.</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p>Patients are randomly assigned to two groups; one being given hydroxychloroquine and the other is given placebo. During two months of treatment, the two groups are treated with either hydroxychloroquine or placebo as a single 200 mg tablet every other day. Patients will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms during the follow-up period. If signs or symptoms occur (fever, cough, shortness of breath), they will be examined and investigated with a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs, COVID-19 specific IgM, IgG antibody assay and a nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&nbsp;</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p> <strong>Problem</strong></p><p><strong>1-</strong> Failure to take regular medication.</p><p>2- Failure to follow other health instructions by participants to prevent the virus.</p><p>3- Inconclusive diagnosis</p><p><br></p><p> <strong>Possible reason</strong></p><p><strong>1- </strong> Chemotherapy induced Nausea &amp; Vomiting.</p><p>2-  Social, cultural, economic reasons.</p><p>3- Symptomatic patients that are negative for repeated their serological and nucleic acid tests.
