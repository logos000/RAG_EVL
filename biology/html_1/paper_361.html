Better availability, shorter processing time, and descending costs have resulted in the increased use of RP. Concomitantly the development of medical applications is expanding. (Zaharia et al., 2017)</p><p><br></p><p>Many different printing technologies exist, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Unfortunately, a common feature of the more functional and productive equipment is the high cost of the equipment, the materials, maintenance, and repair, often accompanied by a need for messy cleaning, difficult post-processing, and sometimes onerous health and safety concerns (Dawood et al., 2015)</p><p><br></p><p>Low-cost 3D printers represent a great opportunity in the dental and medical field, as they could allow surgeons to use 3D models at a very low cost and, therefore, democratize the use of these 3D models in various indications. However, efforts should be made to establish a unified validation protocol for low-cost RP 3D printed models, including accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability tests. Asaumi et al., suggested that dimensional changes may not affect the success of surgical applications if such changes are within a 2% variation .However, the proposed cut-off of 2% should be furthermore discussed, as the same accuracy may be not required for all types of indications. (Silva et al., 2008; Maschio et al., 2016)</p><p><br></p><p>This aim of the present study is to evaluate the dimensional accuracy of the 3D printed mandibular models fabricated by two different additive manufacturing techniques, using highly precise one as selective laser sintering (SLS) and a low-cost one as fused filament fabrication and whether they are both comparable in terms of precision.

Scanning of the model by CBCT will be next , 3D printing of the scanned image using SLS and FFF printers will be done. Recording of same linear measurment will be done on printed models. Comparison of the recorded values vs reference standard is the last step</p><br>Keywords: Conebeam Computed Tomography, 3D printing<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Advances in digital technology and manufacturing have rapidly changed dentistry. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is the most advanced technology in the manufacturing industry because it shortens manufacturing lead time, reduces required costs, and allows printing of items with complex structures. Thus, it has been implemented in dentistry to manufacture clear orthodontic aligners, implant surgical templates, orthognathic surgical wafers, and provisional crowns. Three-dimensional printers produce 3D structures, based on a 3D design file. (Baik et al., 2017)</p><p>Rapid prototyping (RP) is considered as a new technology for the aim of helping dental practitioners, for instance the oral surgeons in the visual and tactile aspects of surgery, providing diagnostic accuracy and increasing the success of surgical planning, and thus, improving outcomes and reducing complications, risks, operative time and the overall cost of treatment. (Walaa Abd et al., 2018)</p><p>RP model fabrication consists of a series of steps starting by, (1) Data acquisition, moving to the (2) Data processing, and ending up with the (3) Model fabrication. Depending on its machining process, producing a working model using the CAD/CAM system may be classified into the following two categories: (1) Subtractive, known as milling or (2) Additive manufacturing technique, also a synonym to 3D printing or Rapid prototyping, using patient oral data acquired with an intraoral scanner. The disadvantages of the milling method include unnecessary loss during milling, high maintenance cost of the equipment, and substantial time loss during the production process. Conversely, the advantages of 3D printing include the production of desired prostheses and models with a minimum amount of material, and the ability to create multiple products at a time. The convenience of such repetitive manufacture considerably enhances clinical efficiency. (Liu et al., 2006; Jeong et al., 2018)</p><p>Additive manufacturing technique includes a number of established technologies either in development or used by small groups of individuals Established rapid prototyping techniques are summarized as follow: Stereolithography (SLA), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM), Inkjet printing techniques. Some fabrication techniques use two materials in the course of constructing parts. . Each technique has its own limitations and applications in producing prototype models. (Rengier et al., 2010)</p><p>The technology has a particular resonance with dentistry, and with advances in 3D imaging and modelling technologies such as cone beam computed tomography, it will become of increasing importance. Uses of 3D printing include the production of drill guides for dental implants, the production of physical models for prosthodontics, orthodontics and surgery, the manufacture of dental, craniomaxillofacial and orthopedic implants, and the fabrication of copings and frameworks for implant and dental restorations. (Dawood et al., 2015)</p><p>CT was by far the most used imaging modality for RP, but also MRI, 3D ultrasonography and nuclear isotope imaging have been used for this indication. Nowadays cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging offers an alternative imaging method for modeling. (Suomalainen et al., 2015)</p><p>In this era of advanced technology, cone‑beam computed tomography (CBCT) has gained popularity in the field of oral radiology due to its advantages over conventional radiography and other three dimensional imaging modalities. The use of CBCT is profoundly increasing for diagnosis and treatment planning in different specialties of dentistry as well as its incorporation in 3D printing process and its diverse applications into the clinical practice.
