We have developed DNA-PAINT-ERS, where E=ethylene carbonate, R=repeating sequence, and S=spacer, for fast and multiplexed superresolution imaging with DNA-PAINT. Here we describe detailed procedures for DNA-PAINT-ERS including reagent preparation, sample labeling, as well as image acqusition and analysis.</p><br>Keywords: superresolution microscopy, single-molecule localization microscopy, DNA-PAINT, multiplexed imaging, antibody oligonucleotide conjugation, immunofluorescence, DNA hybridization<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>DNA-PAINT is a recent technique for superresolution imaging based on subdiffractive localization of single fluorescent events<sup>1</sup>. In DNA-PAINT, the single-molecule events are due to transient binding and unbinding between a pair of DNA oligos, one attached to the affinity agent bound to a specific target and designated the docking strand (DS), and the other conjugated to a fluorophore and designated the imaging strand (IS). The fluorescent IS typically diffuses in the imaging buffer and is not visible until it hybridizes with the DS, upon which a distinct, fluorescent spot is detected on the camera. As such, each fluorescent spot arises from a single IS molecule binding to the DS, and the precise location of the DS (and the underlying target molecule) can be determined through subpixel localization of the single-molecule image. Compared with other superresolution microscopy strategies<sup>2,3</sup>, DNA-PAINT has the advantage of convenient multiplexing: multiple targets can each be labeled with a DNA-barcoded affinity agent (e.g. antibody) and imaged sequentially using corresponding IS oligos in multiple cycles. Since the binding between each pair of IS and DS is transient, the IS used for the current target can be easily and cleanly removed via buffer exchange, and the sample is ready for the next round of imaging using an IS for another target. In practice, however, the use of DNA-PAINT had been hampered by the slow imaging speed, with each imaging session typically taking tens of minutes to hours.</p><p><br></p><p>To overcome this limitation, we have introduced a set of strategies for accelerating multiplexed DNA-PAINT imaging. These strategies comprise the addition of ethylene carbonate, a small molecule that increases DS-IS dissociation (off-) rate with little impact on the association (on-) rate, the usage of repetitive docking sequences in the DS to increase IS binding, and the insertion of a short spacer between the DS and the affinity agent to reduce steric hindrance and increase IS binding<sup>4</sup>. These strategies, collectively termed DNA-PAINT-ERS (E=ethylene carbonate, R=repeating sequence, S=spacer), allows completion of superresolution imaging in 2-5 minutes. DNA-PAINT-ERS uses existing DS-IS pairs and workflows with minor modifications that can be easily implemented. Below we provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for performing single- or dual-color DNA-PAINT-ERS imaging of cellular structures including microtubules, clathrin, and caveolae. The procedures can be readily adapted for imaging other targets and in more colors.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Reagents and supplies for antibody oligo conjugation</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;Docking strand (DS) oligo with a 5’ amino modifier C6 and either a 3’ 6-FAM or Cy3 fluorophore; HPLC purified (Integrated DNA Technologies)</p><p>·&nbsp;Imaging strand (IS) oligo with a 3’ amino modifier; HPLC purified (Integrated DNA Technologies)</p><p>·&nbsp;CF®660R Succinimidyl Ester (Biotium, 92134) or the NHS-ester of another dye of choice</p><p>·&nbsp;DBCO-PEG12-NHS ester (BroadPharm, BP-24149)</p><p>·&nbsp;DBCO-PEG4-NHS ester (Click Chemistry Tools, A134</p><p>·&nbsp;DBCO-Sulfo-NHS ester (Click Chemistry Tools, A124)</p><p>·&nbsp;Azido-PEG4-NHS ester (Click Chemistry Tools, AZ103)</p><p>·&nbsp;Invitrogen™ ultraPure™ DNase/RNase-Free Distilled water (Fisher Scientific, 10977023)</p><p>·&nbsp;Sodium bicarbonate (Fisher Scientific, M-14636)</p><p>·&nbsp;Sodium acetate (Sigma, 55636)</p><p>·&nbsp;Ethanol 200 proof (Fisher Scientific, 04355223)</p><p>·&nbsp;AffiniPure Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immuno Research, 711-005-152)</p><p>·&nbsp;AffiniPure Donkey anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immuno Research, 715-005-150</p><p>·&nbsp;Gibco™ Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) (Fisher Scientific, 14190-144)</p><p>·&nbsp;50 kDa Millipore Sigma™ Amicon™ ultra Centrifugal Filter Units (Fisher Scientific, UFC505096)</p><p>·&nbsp;100 kDa Millipore Sigma™ Amicon™ ultra Centrifugal Filter Units (Fisher Scientific, UFC510024)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reagents and supplies for sample preparation and imaging</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;Beta tubulin monoclonal antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific, 32-2600)</p><p>·&nbsp;Anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody (abcam, ab21679)</p><p>·&nbsp;Anti-caveolin-1 antibody (abcam, ab2910)</p><p>·&nbsp;Paraformaldehyde (Sigma, P6148)</p><p>·&nbsp;Triton X-100 (Sigma, X100)</p><p>·&nbsp;25% glutaraldehyde (Millipore Sigma, G6257)</p><p>·&nbsp;Bovine serum albumin (Fisher Scientific, BP1600)</p><p>·&nbsp;Sodium hydroxide (Fisher Scientific, S318-100)</p><p>·&nbsp;Sodium borohydride (Sigma, 452882)</p><p>·&nbsp;Invitrogen™ Salmon Sperm DNA (Fisher Scientific, AM9680)</p><p>·&nbsp;Sodium azide (Fisher Scientific, AC190381000)</p><p>·&nbsp;Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline with calcium and magnesium (PBS+) (Fisher Scientific, 14-040-182)</p><p>·&nbsp;50 nm gold particles (BBI Solutions, EM.GC50/4)</p><p>·&nbsp;PIPES (Sigma, P6757)</p><p>·&nbsp;HEPES (Fisher Scientific, BP310-500)</p><p>·&nbsp;EGTA (Fisher Scientific, O2783-100)</p><p>·&nbsp;MgSO4 (Acros, 4138-5000)</p><p>·&nbsp;10 M potassium hydroxide (Sigma, 221473)</p><p>·&nbsp;Ethylene carbonate (Fisher Scientific, AC118412500)</p><p>·&nbsp;U2OS cells (ATCC, HTB-96)</p><p>·&nbsp;Gibco DMEM (ThermoFisher, 11995073)</p><p>·&nbsp;Phenol red-free DMEM (Fisher Scientific, 21-063-045)</p><p>·&nbsp;Fetal bovine serum (Fisher Scientific, 26-140-079)</p><p>·&nbsp;0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher, 25200056)</p><p>·&nbsp;Corning tissue culture dishes (Fisher Scientific, 08-772-22)</p><p>·&nbsp;Lab-Tek® II eight-well chambered coverglasses (ThermoFisher Scientific, 155360)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>1.

Commercial or custom single-molecule superresolution microscopy setup. As an example, the custom superresolution microsocope setup used in the demonstrations in this protcol comprises the following: </p><p>Three lasers emitting at 488 nm (Coherent Sapphire 488, 200 mW), 561 nm (Opto Engine LLC, 150 mW), and 647 nm (Coherent OBIS 647, 140 mW) were combined and introduced into the back of a Nikon Ti-U microscope equipped with a 60× TIRF objective (Nikon, Oil immersion, NA 1.49). An f=400 mm lens was placed at the back port of the microscope to focus the collimated laser light to the back aperture of the objective to achieve through-objective total internal reflection (TIR) illumination. The excitation light can be continuously tuned between epi-fluorescence and strict TIR modes by shifting the incident laser horizontally with a translational stage before entering the back port of the microscope. A custom focus stabilizing system based on detection of the reflected excitation laser was used to stabilize the focus during data acquisition. A multi-edge polychroic mirror (Semrock, Di01-R405/488/561/635) was used to reflect the lasers into the objective and clean up fluorescence signals from the sample. Emission filters used for the 488 nm (for imaging FAM on the DS), 561 nm (for imaging Cy3 on the DS), and 647 nm (for imaging CF660R conjugated imager strands) were FF01-525/45, FF01-605/64, FF01-708/75, respectively (all from Semrock). Fluorescence signals were collected through the objective by an electron-multiplied charge-coupled device (EM-CCD, Andor, iXon Ultra 897) using a typical EM gain setting at 200-300 in frame transfer mode.</p><p><br></p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong><u>Antibody oligo (DS) conjugation </u></strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>I.
