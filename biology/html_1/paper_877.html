However, CBEs or ABEs only generate single type of nucleotide conversions, which limits the sequence diversity of edited site and therapeutic applications at certain circumstances. A dual base editor(A&amp;C-BEmax) has been developed to achieve both C•G to T•A and A•T to G•C mutations through fusion of cytidine and adenosine deaminases to Cas9n. In this protocol, we demonstrate the generation of diverse point mutations, including a simultaneous -113A-to-G and -114C-to-T conversions, in the hemoglobin gamma (HBG) gene promoter region in HUDEP-2 cells through A&amp;C-BEmax with a single sgRNA, leading to reactivation of γ-globin for the potential treatment of β-hemoglobinopathy. A&amp;C-BEmax is a valuable tool not only for dissecting the function of genomic sequence at a single base resolution but also for the therapeutics of genetic disorders. This step-by-step protocol is related to the publication “Dual base editor catalyzes both cytidine and adenine base conversions in human cells” in Nature Biotechnology.</p><br>Keywords: Base editing, A&C-BEmax,Gene therapy, Human cells<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Base editors, including cytidine(CBE) and adenosine(ABE) editors, have been developed through fusion of nucleotide deaminases to nuclease impaired Cas9 variants <sup>1-4</sup>. The commonly used base editors BE3 and ABE7.10 typically generate C•G to T•A or A•T to G•C conversions within a ~5-nucleotide editing window on the target DNA respectively, without inducing DNA double strand breaks<sup>1, 2</sup>. These advantegies make them promising gene-editing tools in disease modeling<sup>3, 4</sup>, genetic breeding<sup>5</sup>, gene therapy<sup>6</sup> and other areas.Many efforts have been made to improve the performance of the base editors. Through recruitment of multiple cytidine deaminase domains to mutant Cas9 protein (CRISPR-X<sup>7</sup> or BE-Plus<sup>8</sup>), using activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) instead of APOBEC1<sup>9</sup>, or fusing deaminase with circularly permuted Cas9<sup>10</sup>, CBEs with wider editing window were created to increase the genomic diversification which has multiple use, such as directed protein evolution. However, CBE or ABE could only catalyze single type of nucleotide, either C•G to T•A or A•T to G•C, which limits the diversity of the products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Through fusion of cytidine and adenosine deaminases to Cas9n (SpCas9 D10A), a dual base editor, A&amp;C-BEmax has been developed. A&amp;C-BEmax can generate simultaneous A-to-G and C-to-T base conversions in the same allele with increased CBE editing window and activity. As A&amp;C-BEmax generates more mutant allele types suggesting increased mutation spectra of the products, it exhibits a broad potential for investigation and modification of both coding and non-coding sequences at a single base resolution. As an example, we have demonstrated that A&amp;C-BEmax could generate various point mutations, including simultaneous C-to-T and A-to-G conversions, in the promoter of HBG1/2 in HUDEP-2 cells with a single sgRNA for the potential treatment of β-hemoglobinopathy.
