Here we present the protocol for the preparation of various biological samples for the recording of extracellular signals using HD-MEA, including primary cortical neurons, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neurons, rodent brain slices, retina, and iPSC-derived neuronal spheroids.</p><br>Keywords: Electrophysiology, high-density microelectrode arrays, extracellular recording<br><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Biological Samples</strong></p><p>Embryonic-day-18 Wistar rat</p><p>C57 Black/6 mice</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Chemicals</strong></p><p>Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%, Life Technologies, Cat#25200056)</p><p>Polyethylenimine&nbsp;(PEI, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#181978)</p><p>Laminin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#L2020)</p><p>Poly-D-lysine (Thermo Fisher, Cat#A3890401)</p><p>Geltrex (Thermo Fisher, Cat#A1569601)</p><p>AMES’ medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#A1420)</p><p>Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)</p><p>4-aminopyrindine (4-AP, Sigma Aldrich, 275875)</p><p>Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)&nbsp;</p><p>Neurobasal Medium (ThermoFisher, 21103049)</p><p>DMEM/F12 (ThermoFisher, 21331-020)</p><p>Glutamax (ThermoFisher, 35050061)</p><p>Penicillin-Streptomycin (FUJIFILM Wako, 168-23191)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Experimental Models: Cell Lines&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Human iPSC-derived glutamatergic neurons (Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics International, Cat#01279)&nbsp;</p><p>Human iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons ( Elixirgen Scientific, Cat#DA-SeV-CW50065)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>High-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA)</p><p>Stage-top incubator (Tokai Hit)</p><p>SCAD device (Stem Cell &amp; Device Laboratory, Inc.)</p><p>Tissue holder (MaxWell Biosystems AG)</p><p>Vibrotome (Leica VT1200S)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>Protocol for culturing primary neurons on MEAs</strong></p><p>1. Sterilize the MEA with 70% ethanol for 20 min.</p><p>2.

Obtain the brain from C57 Black/6 mice (16–21 days old for cerebellar slices, 6-8 weeks old for hippocampal slices), then place in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) cutting solution (in [mM]: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>; the osmolarity of the solution was ~310&nbsp;mOsmol/L, and bubbled with carboxygen: 95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>2. Obtain coronal hippocampal slices and parasagittal cerebellum slices (300 μm thickness)&nbsp;with a vibratome (Leica VT1200S).</p><p>3. The slices are then stabilized at room temperature for at least 1 h in the oxygenated ACSF before transferring to the MEA recording chamber for experiments.</p><p>4. Place the acute slices on top of the array and hold in place with a membrane (Tissue Holder, MaxWell Biosystems AG, Zurich, Switzerland).</p><p>5. During the experiments, perfuse the slices with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in [mM]: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.9 MgSO<sub>4</sub>) with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) at 32-35°C with a heater (TC01, Multi-channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany).</p><p>5. For drug application on hippocampal slices, 4-aminopyrindine (4-AP) stock solution is prepared by dissolving it in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −20 ̊C. 4-AP is diluted into ACSF to 100 µM just before the experiments.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Protocol for extracellular recording from retina using MEAs</strong></p><p>1. Isolate retinae from adult Wistar rats. The eyes are dissected at room temperature under dim&nbsp;red light conditions in Ames solution (Sigma, A1420) continuously&nbsp;equilibrated with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-95% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>2. Remove the vitreous, and&nbsp;place a retina patch with ganglion-cell-side down on the electrode array and perfuse with Ames solution&nbsp;(pH 7.4, 35°C) equilibrated with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-95% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>3. Pressed the retina path onto the array with a polyester membrane (Tissue Holder, MaxWell Biosystems AG, Zurich, Switzerland).</p><p>4. Retinal ganglion&nbsp;cell extracellular activity could be recorded for 1– 2 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>5. For light stimulation, a LED flashlight with light pulses with a frequency of 0.5 Hz is used.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Protocol for extracellular recording from iPSC-derived neuronal spheroids using MEAs</strong></p><p>1. The dopaminergic neuronal spheroids were prepared using a published protocol (DOI:</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.pex-954/v1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10.21203/rs.3.pex-954/v1</a>) . The human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were induced to form dopaminergic progenitor cells (DAPs). The steps included to start with a high-density culture, to use cell sorting whiel applying a cell surface marker for floor plate, and to establish a maturation culture to form floating aggregates.</p><p>2. Coat the surface of the array with PEI and laminin to promote tissue adhesion.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Conduct the experiments inside an incubator for a control of environmental conditions (36 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Protocol&nbsp;for SCAD devices</strong></p><p>1. The surface of the SCAD Cell Scaffold&nbsp;(SCAD, SCAD-CS™, CD023) is coated with 0.002% PLO (Poly-L-Ornithine, Sigma Aldrich, P4957-50ML) and 10 μg/mL laminin (Sigma Aldrich, L2020).</p><p>2. The human iPSC-derived neurons (Quick-Neuron™ Dopaminergic-Human iPSC-derived Neurons&nbsp;, Elixirgen Scientific, DA-SeV-CW50065) are plated onto the SCAD Cell Scaffold inside well plates at a density of 70,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>3. The culture is plated and maintained following the protocol from the supplier (<a href="https://elixirgenscientific.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/protocol/qndsvf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://elixirgenscientific.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/protocol/qndsvf.pdf</a>). Briefly, a Medium N [Neurobasal Medium (ThermoFisher, 21103049) with DMEM/F12 (ThermoFisher, 21331-020), Glutamax (ThermoFisher, 35050061), Penicillin-Streptomycin (FUJIFILM Wako, 168-23191), and Component N] containing 10 µM Y27632 (Nacalai, 08945) is used to seed cells, and the medium is changed to Medium N with Component D2, Component D3 on the next day and again change half volume on Day 3. Half of the medium is replaced with fresh Medium N with Component D4 and Component D5 on Day 4. Then, total amount of the medium is replaced with fresh Medium N with Component D4 and Component D6 on Day 5 and half volume on Day 7. Neurobasal Plus medium containing B-27 Plus supplement (ThermoFisher, A3653401) is used after Day 10 and thereafter. Half of the Neurobasal Plus medium is replaced every 3 or 4 day.</p><p>4. SCAD device cultured for 112 days could be mounted on HD-MEA chip and neural activities could be recorded. The SCAD device is placed and pressed onto the array with a membrane (Tissue Holder, MaxWell Biosystems AG, Zurich, Switzerland).</p></body></html>
