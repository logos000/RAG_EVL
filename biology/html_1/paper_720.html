However, no instrument/technique can predictably eliminate all the microorganisms from the root canal system. The cleaning efficacy of endodontic instruments significantly decreases at the apical third of root canals. Many root canals have curvatures, and endodontic instruments tend to return to their original straight position during instrumentation of curved canals. Dentinal wall thickness in root canals has a direct relationship with root resistance to lateral forces.</p><p>Instruments and instrumentation techniques should be chosen and combined based on their shaping ability, particularly in curved canals, and on the possibility to achieve faster preparations, without deviations. The various NiTi file systems commercially available have different characteristics in terms of their cross-sectional shape, rake angle, taper, depth of flutes, and number of spirals or flutes per unit length  all these conditions may affect file behavior. </p><p>  </p><p>Manufacturers are introducing various NiTi rotary systems with improved flexibility &amp; superior canal anatomy preservation properties. Different methods have been conducted to improve the physical as well as the mechanical properties of the rotary NiTi. Among these methods is the heat treatment of NiTi toproduce a better arrangement of the crystal structure. Thereby leading to increased flexibility and improve fatigue resistance or plastic behavior. </p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Binocular stereo microsope</p><p>Scanning electron microscope</p><p>AutoCAD (Software)</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p>-Teeth will be collected and immersed in 5.25% NaOCl solution for 15 min </p><p><br></p><p>-The teeth will be stored in sterile saline until usage to preserve natural teeth hydration.</p><p><br></p><p>-Teeth will be radiographed using a conventional periapical radiograph </p><p><br></p><p>-According to radiograph, only Mesiobuccal canals with a 25<sup>o</sup>-40<sup>o</sup> degree curvature according to Schneider’s method<sup> </sup>and with a fully formed apices will be used in this study.</p><p><br></p><p>-Teeth will be flattened to obtain a standard root length of approximately 15 mm.</p><p><br></p><p>-The canals will be irrigated with Saline during instrumentation; 3 ml between each subsequent file size change. </p><p><br></p><p>-After preparation the canals will be dried with paper points. </p><p><br></p><p>- 15mm of the mesiobuccal canal only will be used and the distal root will be removed by a TF-13 stone.
