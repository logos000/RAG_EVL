While its use in cell culture has been broadly reported in several studies, data on immunostaining in tissues has been sparse and inconsistent. In this protocol we report a methodology to stain phospho-myosin light chain 2 (pMLC2 Ser19) and double phospho-myosin light chain 2 (ppMLC2Thr18/ Ser19) in adult murine epidermis.</p><br>Keywords: pMLC2, ppMLC2, adult murine skin, epidermis<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Note that myosin activity may vary in different tissues and developmental vs. adult stages.

Ensure that the blocking solution covers the entire tissue section.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Primary Antibodies</u></p><p>Incubate tissue sections with primary antibodies diluted in antibody buffer overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber. Verify that the antibody solution covers the entire tissue section. Use pMLC2 Ser19 (CST #3675) at 1:200 dilution and ppMLC2 Thr18/ Ser19 (CST #3674) at 1:100 dilution.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Secondary Antibodies</u></p><p>Wash the tissue sections 2x with PBS<sup>++</sup> for 5 minutes each.</p><p>Incubate tissue sections with secondary antibodies and DAPI (2µg/ml) for 1h at room temperature in a humidified chamber in the dark.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Mounting</u></p><p>Wash the tissue sections 2x with PBS<sup>++</sup> for 5 minutes each.</p><p>Briefly wash the tissue sections 1x with H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>Mount tissue sections in Mowiol. Ensure that the Mowiol solution covers the entire tissue section. Remove any air bubbles. </p><p>Cover with coverslip.</p><p>Let the Mowiol solidify for 24 hours (store dry in the dark at room temperature).</p><p>Seal slides with quick-dry nail polish.</p><p>Store samples in the cold and dark until further analysis.</p><p><br></p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>Use freshly cut tissue sections, and evaluate their quality at a light microscope before staining.</p><p>Prepare all solutions freshly.</p><p>Proceed with image analysis within a couple of days after mounting.</p><p>Take a secondary antibody control sample along to evaluate potential unspecific binding /background.</p><p>Specificity could be further verified by immunostaining consecutive tissue sections that have been subjected to alkaline phosphatase treatment to remove phosphorylated epitopes (see separate protocol at Protocol Exchange).</p><p><br></p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>Total: 1.5 days </p><p>Deparaffinization: 35 minutes</p><p>Antigen Retrieval: 20 minutes boiling plus 1 hour cooling</p><p>Blocking: 1 hour</p><p>Primary antibody staining: Overnight</p><p>Secondary antibody staining/ nuclear counterstaining:<strong> </strong>1 hour</p><p><br></p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>pMLC2 and ppMLC2 immunostaining should be visible as a mostly cortical&nbsp;signal in the different layers of the epidermis. In the dermis, blood vessels should be strongly positive, whereas fibroblasts may show a moderate signal using this protocol.</p><p><br></p></body></html>
