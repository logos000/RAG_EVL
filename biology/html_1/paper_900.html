We posted a new idea--<strong>multiplier grid (MG)</strong>--online in mid-March 2020 and circulated a writeup by email shortly after to address this issue. It enables use of a <u>moderate number of test kits</u> to <u>screen a large number of individuals</u> to look for a <u>small number of infected individuals</u>. Now, we describe a protocol to implement the MG based on <u>existing diagnostic technologies</u> and <u>existing automated lab equipment</u>. Using industry standard 96-well plate (reserving first 2 wells for positive/negative controls), screening 94*94 = <u>8,836 individuals</u> needs only 2*96 = <u>192 sets of test kits</u>, with <u>multiplier being 46</u>. If a test costs $250/kit, with MG per person cost goes down to about <u>$5</u>. The <u>very low cost</u> makes <u>periodic blanket screening</u> (e.g. twice weekly) post-lockdown feasible, without putting pressure on reagent supply and equipment time. Going further, <u>pooling samples</u> from individuals that share the same basic unit of the population beforehand <u>boosts the multiplier</u> further to 46*4 = 184 for average household size of 4, and the number of individuals screened to 94*94*4 = <u>34,344</u>, using only 2*96 + 4 = <u>196 sets of test kits</u>. the MG can also be used in <u>livestock farming</u> to detect infection early to avoid mass culling.</p><br>Keywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, screening, many persons, sample pooling, infection<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p><strong><u>Background</u></strong><u>:</u></p><p>In a previous paper circulated by email and a description posted online before that, this author described a cost-, time- and material-efficient method (“<strong>multiplier grid (MG) method</strong>”) to perform screening to look for a few disease carriers among many individuals. The number of individuals can be 10,000, e.g. in a small town or a university campus, or 1,000, e.g. in a school or a corporate campus.</p><p>Given the large number of individual samples involved, a <u>very high throughput</u> (VHT) workflow is needed to put the method to practice.</p><p>Besides, if it is to support blanket screening at an international airport that sees more than 100,000 departures a day, with some 10,000 or more an hour, it must not take too long. Here, <u>turnaround time</u> is also an important factor of consideration.</p><p>In many countries, the number of hospital beds ranges from 1 to 3 for every 1,000 persons. Since blanket screening should be done before patient number begins to overload the hospitals, the MG method is expected to be deployed long before disease carriers hit 0.1% of the population, or 1 in 1,000. This means a robust public health surveillance sytem should aim for detection and isolation before the percentage hits 0.01%, or 1 in 10,000. We show, <u>using the industry standard 96-well plate for automated lab equipment</u> (reserving first 2 wells for positive/negative controls), that <u>screening for 94*94 = 8,836 individuals can be done using 2*96 = 192 sets of test kits, achieving a multiplier of 46</u>. For a test that costs $250/kit, that goes down to about $5/individual, making periodic blanket screening as disease surveillance acceptable in terms of cost, not to mention avoiding putting pressure on material supply and equipment time.</p><p>For a very busy international airport like the Los Angeles International Airport, with more than 10,000 arrivals an hour, it means a mere 192 test kits per hour suffices to detect up to 20 disease carriers in a day, which is expected some 2 months after outbreak begins in some foreign country of an infectious disease with incubation period of 5 days. For a small town with that size of population that has just emerged from lockdown, to be able to detect presence of and immediately isolate up to 20 infected persons in one day virtually guarantees to block return of the disease. And for a corporate campus of 10,000 employees, to be able to safely re-open the campus after lockdown depends on notonly on blanket screening but also on periodic screening of its entire campus population every three or four days until the disease is totally banished from the wider community. </p><p><strong><u>Very High Throughput (VHT) MG Workflow:</u></strong></p><p>By way of example, this paper presents a very high throughput (VHT) MG workflow (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>) based on commercially available high throughput (HT) equipment already in use in the medical diagnostics industry. It can be easily modified to suit different parameter values (N, P, plate well count, etc.) and optimization goals (<u>turnaround time</u>, <u>cost</u>, <u>reagent quantities</u>, i<u>ntrinsic clustering &amp; hierarchies within population</u>, etc.). See final section in this paper, <strong>Suggested Modifications &amp; Optimizations</strong>.</p><p>The example below is a two (P=2) dimensional multiplier grid having axis size N = 94, capable of screening 94*94 = 8,836 samples in each run in under three(3) hours (including 1 hour for qPCR reactions). <u>Extension to higher dimension and/or different N values and/or 384-well plates will become self-evident</u>.</p><p>To find out which <em>one</em> of the 94*94 = 8,836 input samples carries a pathogen, the MG method proceeds as follows, consuming merely 2*96 = 192 sets of reagents, reactions and equipment time instead of 8,836 sets. <u>Multiplying factor is 46 times</u>. Thus, a <strong>46-to-1 test methodology</strong>.</p><p>For VHT workflow, lay input samples out across 94 industry-standard 96-well plates, the 96 wells laid out in 12 columns (labeled columns 1 to 12 from left to right) by 8 rows (labeled rows A to H from top to bottom) (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). Leave the first two wells—well A1 &amp; A2—empty for adding positive and negative controls just before reactions. <strong>Label the plates a3 through h12</strong>, like the wells--except lowercase roman letters are used to distinguish plate labels from well labels--, for plate-to-well pooling in Step 2 below. Altogether there are 94*94 = 8,836 input samples, each <u>1mL</u>.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p><strong><u>Equipment:</u></strong> (Prices are indications only and provided only to aid preliminary budgeting.)</p><p>2x (semi-)automated 96-channel pipette.

To do so, it needs only 94 sets of reagents and reactions and equipment time. It will collect a fraction of the sample fluid in each well—called <strong>aliquot</strong>—from plate a3—the first plate—, <strong>add up aliquots from all 94 wells in the <em><u>same</u></em><u> input sample plate</u></strong> to form a pooled sample, <u>concentrate</u> it, <u>purify</u> it, and <u>send for reaction</u> (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). Likewise for plate a4. Next, plate a5. And so on, until plate h12.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>In practice, high throughput (HT) machines will run reactions on <strong>all 94 pools of samples concurrently in a plate of 96 wells</strong> (“<u>Set 1 pooled sample plate</u>”), with wells A3 through H12 holding the pooled samples from input sampling plates a3 through h12, respectively, while wells A1 and A2 holding positive/negative controls (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>, left half).</p><p><strong>3. </strong>If all come up empty (aka negative), then that’s it—there’s no pathogen, all input samples are in the clear, and we move on.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>But if there is <em>one</em> (or more) input sample that has the pathogen, one (or more) of the plates will turn up positive from the reactions. Then the method continues as follows.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Get a <u>new 96-well plate</u>. Leave the first two wells empty for positive/negative controls. Transfer aliquots from <em>only</em> the tested-positive input sample plate(s), with wells A3 to H12 receiving aliquots from the respective same-label wells of those plates.</p><p><strong>6. </strong>In <u>fast turnaround practice</u>, setting up this new plate only after results from reactions on the Set 1 pooled sample plate are known adds unacceptable delay. In this situation, this new plate is set up and sent for reactions concurrently with the Set 1 pooled sample plate. In order to do so, instead of selecting only tested-positive input sample plates to pool aliquots from their wells, <strong>add up aliquots from <em>all (94)</em> same wells</strong> <strong>across <em><u>all </u></em><u>(94) input sample plates</u></strong> to place into each well of the new plate (“<u>Set 2 pooled sample plate</u>”) (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>, right half).</p><p><strong>7. </strong>Take this Set 2 pooled sample plate through <u>concentration</u>, <u>purification</u> and <u>reactions</u> (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). If none turns out positive, something is wrong with either this set of reactions or the previous one. Otherwise, at least one out of 94 will turn out positive.</p><p><strong>8. </strong>Say exactly one plate turns positive, say plate e7, and exactly one reaction in the second set of reactions turns positive, say well D11. Then the pathogen has been found in input sample plate e7, its well D11. In this scenario, we have located the pathogen using 96*2 = <u>192 sets of reagents and reactions</u>.</p><p><strong>9. </strong><u>Alternatively</u>, say <u>two input sample plates turn positive</u>, say plate e7 <u>and</u> h2, and <u>two reactions in the second set of reactions turn positive</u>, say well D11 <u>and</u> G8. Then the pathogen has been found those wells in those input sample plates, in total 4 wells: (1) input sample plate e7 in its wells D11 and G8, and (2) input sample plate h2 in its wells D11 and G8. Now take four aliquots from those wells from those two input sample plates and send for reactions, the third time now. It may turn out that all four test positive, or three of them, or two of them, but not just one. In this scenario, we have located the pathogen using 96*2 + 4 = <u>196 sets of reagents and reactions</u>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Concentrating and Purifying Pooled Samples:</u> See protocols in uploaded pdf.</strong></p><p>We are given the following:</p><p>At the above Steps 1 to 2 and 6, two pooled sample plates are produced—Set 1 and Set 2 pooled sample plates. Pooling 94 aliquots—250uL each—results in fairly large volume, almost <u>25mL</u>—far more than can be held in a well—, and 94 of them.</p><p>Sample purification, here nucleic acid (RNA/DNA) extraction, using commercial kit, can only take in a small volume, 400uL for one commercial extraction kit (“sample volume”). At the end of extraction, <u>20uL</u> is the smallest volume (“elution volume”) that is produced.</p><p>And finally, out of the elution volume, only <u>5uL</u> will go into each reaction.</p><p>Two reactions will be performed per pooled sample. Test is positive if either turns positive.</p><p>How to <strong><u>concentrate 2 times 94 pools of nearly 25mL/pool down to 400uL/pool (about 60X) in a high throughput manner is the problem being addressed in this paper</u></strong> in order to make many-to-1 test methodology practical. The workflow must avoid <u>human errors</u> or <u>cross contamination</u> between samples or sample pools. This is the subject matter of the next section.</p><p>After concentrating the Set 1 and Set 2 sample pools, each set is laid out in 94 portions of 400uL/portion across 94 wells in a final pooled sample plate of 96 wells (wells A1 and A2 to be taken up by positive and negative controls). The plates are now ready to go for purification.</p><p>In sample purification, the two sets of 94 concentrates each go through conventional nucleic acid extraction to purify the pooled samples, using commercial high-throughput extractor machines and commercial high-throughput virus nucleic acid isolation kits.</p><p>Now, eluates (20uL each) from the purication step in two plates of 96 wells are ready for reactions. From each well, 5uL will be added to reagents for one reaction and another 5uL for a second reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></body></html>
