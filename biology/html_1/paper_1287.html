Although several methods Have been developed for the isolation and purification of EVs, ultracentrifugation (UC) is still considered the gold standard to isolate EVs. UC is widely used to isolate EVs, from both biological fluids (e.g. plasma) and cellular conditioned media [<a href="#_ENREF_7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">7</a>].</p><p>Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) is a biophysical method based on optical density tracking of particles. NTA can simultaneously measure the size distribution and concentration of particles, such as EVs, suspended in a liquid. NTA uses laser light scattering microscopy with a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera. Briefly, based on the Brownian motion of the particles, which are considered as having a spherical shape, the diffusion coefficient of each tracked particle is calculated using the Stokes-Einstein equation; the movement of every single particle is tracked and then used to estimate particle size [<a href="#_ENREF_8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">8</a>]. </p><p>This protocol aims to provide a method to isolate EVs from plasma samples and facilitate high-precision particle quantitation by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA). Moreover, as the large majority of the papers describing NTA data focus on the mean size or the mean concentration of EVs, we propose a new statistical approach to consider all the sample sizes and a graph designed to report these results.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>Phosphate buffer saline (PBS)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>EDTA tubes</p><p>15.0ml centrifuge tubes </p><p>Refrigerate centrifuge (4°C)</p><p>Vacuum pump</p><p>Ultracentrifugation tubes (13.5ml Quick-Seal®&nbsp;Round-Top Ultra-Clear Tube-Beckman Coulter)</p><p>Red Aluminium Quick-Seal Spacer (Beckman Coulter)</p><p>Quick-Seal Cordless&nbsp;Tube Topper&nbsp;(Beckman Coulter)</p><p>1.0ml Insulin syringe</p><p>2.5ml Syringe (needle dimension 0.9 mm x 25 mm)</p><p>10.0ml Syringe (needle dimension 0.9 mm x 25 mm)</p><p>0.10-μm pore-size polyether sulfone filter (StericupRVP, Merck Millipore; Burlington, MA, USA).</p><p>Ultracentrifuge (Optima™ MAX-XP Beckman Coulter, equipped with ML-55 rotor)</p><p>Cutter</p><p>Sterile cotton swab</p><p>1000µl tips</p><p>NS300 NanoSight System (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, United Kingdom)</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>Isolation of extracellular vesicles from blood plasma by ultracentrifugation.</strong></p><p>1.

Remove cell debris from plasma by serial centrifugation at 1000, 2000, and 3000×g for 15 minutes at 4 °C.</p><p>4. Use a 2.5 ml syringe (needle dimension 0,9 mm x 25 mm) to transfer 1.5 mL of fresh plasma into a Quick-Seal ultra-clear centrifuge tube and fill up with PBS filtered with a 0.10 μm pore size polyether sulfone filter (StericupRVP, Merck Millipore; Burlington, MA, USA).

Use 1mL insulin syringe to carry the sample on the syringe pump.</p><p>4. Set syringe pump at infusion rate 30 to have the same constant flow for</p><p>all samples.</p><p>5. The acquisition for each sample is performed at camera level 13. Five 30-s recordings for each sample (Supplementary FIle).</p><p>6. Check the analysis setting before going on with the batch process. The number of particles per frame must be 20–120. Set detection threshold to have &lt; 5 not valid track per frame. The ratio between total particles track and valid track must be &lt; 5.</p><p>7. Collected data are analyzed with NTA software (Malvern Panalytical Ltd.), which provided high-resolution particle-size distribution profiles as well as measurements of the EVs concentration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Statistical method to analyze data from Nanosight</strong></p><p>To compare EVs concentration for each size in different groups (i.e. cases vs controls) we apply generalized multivariable linear models, using the appropriate logit link function. We estimate adjusted EV mean concentration or EV geometric mean concentration as appropriate. For each size, from 30nm to 700nm, we compare the EV mean differences between groups. Due to the high number of comparisons, we apply a multiple comparison method based on Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) to calculate the FDR P-value. Results are reported as a series graph for EV mean concentrations of each size by group and vertical bar charts to represent the size-specific p-values obtained comparing groups. For all the graphs, X-axis is the size of EVs. In Figure 2 we report an example of this analysis.</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>1. We resuspend the sample with PBS three-time filtered through a 0.10-μm pore-size polyether sulfone filter (Millipore membrane filters) to avoid interference in NTA analysis as background noise. </p><p>2. With NTA-acquisition settings constant between analyses, our approach will enable the mean, mode, and median particle size together with EV concentration to be more precisely compared between different samples.</p><p>3. Remove the command “Advanced sample prompt” on NTA software, to allow the syringe pump flow to be continuous among the five recordings.</p><p>4. Between samples, push 2 ml of water through the sample chamber, to remove any particles present. After use, the chamber can be disassembled to be cleaned and then reassembled. Rinse the seal and the glass on the underside of the gasket component with a low-pressure source of water and then an up to 10%ethanol-water solution; finally dry with tissue papers without rubbing but gently tapping.</p><h2>References</h2><p>&nbsp;1.
