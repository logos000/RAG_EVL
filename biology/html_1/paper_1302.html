limited funds, many laboratories cannot afford the purchase of precast denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels for protein electrophoresis.&nbsp;However, an effective means to reduce cost is to re-use these gel cassettes to pour SDS-polyacrylamide gels in-house.&nbsp;The Bio-Rad Criterion gel system has been proven to be very versatile given that gels can have up to 26 wells.&nbsp;Here we describe how the Criterion plastic gel cassettes can be re-used several times.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>- Agarose, 2%, made in deionised water</p><p>- Deionised water</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>- Used, clean

deionised water.&nbsp;Microwave until agarose has fully melted.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use a pair of plastic gel plates, consisting of a front and back plate (Figure 1A).&nbsp;The back plate contains the buffer reservoir for electrophoresis (see Figure 1B for side-view of the plate).&nbsp;It is important that the plates originated from the same cassette, as the plastic connectors break differently when the plates were separated).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash plates with warm water (note that hot water will deform the plastic), dry with paper towels.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join plates together and lay them flat on an elevated surface such as a pipette tip box (Figure 2A).&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow easy access to the gaps between the plate, without lifting them up.</p><p><strong>5</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using masking tape, seal the bottom slit of the front plate.&nbsp;Fold over the ends of the tape so that it can easily be peeled off prior to electrophoresis (Figure 2B).</p><p><strong>6</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, place a second piece of masking tape near the top just under the well numbers (Figure 2C).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flip the gel cassette over and firmly pull tape around and tape on opposing plate, such that the two plates are firmly held together by the tape (Figure 2D). &nbsp;Rub fingers firmly on the tape.</p><p><strong>8</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for agarose solution to cool to approximately 80<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;Take up agarose solution with a 1&nbsp;ml pipette, avoiding intake of air bubbles.&nbsp;Place the pipette tip on the left side of the gel, and between the two plates close to the gap, as indicated in the Figure 3A.&nbsp;Slowly expel the solution in-between the gap. &nbsp;During this procedure do not lift up the cassette, instead it must be kept horizontal at all time. &nbsp;If parts of the gap are still not filled with agarose, move along the gap and inject agarose solution where needed.</p><p>Hot (80<sup>o</sup>C) agarose solution will allow it to 1) flow easily deeply between the thin gaps, leading to a better seal; and 2) to naturally flow along the seam without needing to move the pipette tip.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping the plate in its horizontal position, repeat procedure, but starting on the right side of the cassette.</p><p><strong>10</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping the plate in its horizontal position, repeat the same procedure, but starting from the bottom gap (Figure 3B).&nbsp;Since this gap is more narrow, make sure the agarose solution is still hot, to allow it to flow easily into the gap.&nbsp;Slowly run the pipette tip back and forth along the gap, and ensure the gap is fully filled with agarose.&nbsp;Pipette slowly to avoid air bubbles entering the gap.&nbsp;If air bubbles did enter the gap, they can be removed with an empty 200&nbsp;µL tip attached to a pipette, by sucking up the air bubbles.</p><p><strong>11</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not lift the cassette or move it, until the agarose has solidified.</p><p><strong>12</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place the cassette upright in a peg rack, as shown in Figure 4A.&nbsp;Best results are achieved when the cassette fits firmly in the rack.&nbsp;This will apply slight pressure on the plates, pressing them against each other, ensuring the acrylamide will not leak out.</p><p><strong>13</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place medium sized bulldog clips on either side of the cassette as indicated in Figure 4B.</p><p><strong>14</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping the cassettes in the rack, lift the rack and tilt at a 45<sup>o </sup>angle as illustrated in Figure 5A below.&nbsp;Take up hot agarose solution with a 1&nbsp;ml pipette.&nbsp;Place the pipette tip on right inside edge of the cassette.&nbsp;Allow the agarose solution to flow down along the inside edge and to the bottom.&nbsp;Tilt the rack and cassette back to the horizontal position, allowing the agarose solution to continue flowing along the bottom inside edge of the cassettes.&nbsp;Repeat on the left side (Figure 5B).&nbsp;Repeat the process, until there is at least 2-3mm of agarose along the bottom inside edge of the cassettes (Figure 5C).&nbsp;This will require approximately 1.5&nbsp;ml of agarose solution in total).&nbsp;Allow the agarose to set.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>15</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Test the sealed cassette for any potential leaks by squeezing water into the cassette using a wash bottle (Figure 6A).</p><p><strong>16</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill up cassette with water (Figure 6B).&nbsp;Leave for a few minutes to give time for the sighting of any leaks.</p><p><strong>17</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirmation that the cassette is note leaking, discard the water by carefully inverting the rack over a sink while holding the cassette in place.&nbsp;Place the rack with the cassette back on the bench.&nbsp;Insert a strip of blotting/filter paper between the plates to remove any remaining water (Figure 6C).&nbsp;Several pieces of absorbent paper may be needed to remove all water.&nbsp;Note that stiffer absorbent paper such as Whatman paper works best.</p><p><strong>18</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cassette is ready for pouring the SDS-PAGE gel.&nbsp;For pouring a gradient gel see reference (1).&nbsp;Cassettes will generally require 15mls of acrylamide to fill.&nbsp;Plates that have been used several times may have become bent slightly, meaning that slightly more volume is needed for pouring the gel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>19</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place the comb into the cassette, between the plates, as far as it can be pushed in (Figure 7A).&nbsp;Place the comb slowly between the plates and holding it initially at an angle, this well help to not trap any air bubbles between the teeth of the comb.</p><p><strong>20</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fix the comb to the plates using two large bulldog clips, to hold the comb firmly in place (Figure 7B).&nbsp;It is important to place the bulldog clips just above the teeth of the comb as indicated in the image, to prevent acrylamide being squeezed out of the cassette.</p><p><strong>21</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the acrylamide set, this will take approximately 1.5 hours.</p><p><strong>22</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove cassette from the rack, remove the bull clips, but Do NOT remove the tape.&nbsp;Wet a paper towel with water and wrap around the cassette, then wrap tightly in plastic wrap (Figures 8A-8C).&nbsp;Store in fridge over night to allow for full polymerisation and best results.&nbsp;Gels can be stored for up to two weeks at 4<sup>o</sup>C with little effect on protein separation.</p><p><strong>23</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before running the gel, carefully remove the tape covering the slit of the front pate, but do NOT remove the second piece of tape holding the plates together.&nbsp;Carefully insert the gel cassette into the electrophoresis unit.&nbsp;Add running buffer to the top reservoir.&nbsp;Add running buffer in the bottom chamber only until the meniscus is approximately 1cm above the slit in the front plate.&nbsp;It is important that not more running buffer is added to the bottom reservoir, as otherwise ions could freely move through the sides of cassettes</p><p><strong>24</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After running the gel, remove the tape and separate the plates.&nbsp;Remove the SDS-PAGE gel for further processing.&nbsp;Remove and discard any excess acrylamide gel and agarose, wash plates in warm water, dry with paper towels, and store until next use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p><strong>Cassette leaks when pouring acrylamide gel</strong>: </p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always check for leakage first by adding water into the prepared cassette, to make sure there will be no leakage when pouring the acrylamide gel.&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure no air bubbles trapped in the agar when sealing the cassette with agarose.&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use hot (80<sup>o</sup>C) agarose solution to ensure it can fully enter the gap between the plates.&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid using plates that originated from different cassettes.&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure the cassette is not moved, until the agarose has fully solidified.&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensure, when pouring the acrylamide gel, that the plates are firmly pushed together by the bulldog clips and by the peg rack.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Difficulty inserting agarose solution into bottom gap of cassettes</strong>: &nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attach a yellow 200&nbsp;µL pipette tip onto the end of the blue tip to more easily insert the agarose solution between the gap of the two plates.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Volume of acrylamide required to fill cassette is more than 15mls</strong>: </p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the volume is only slightly different (up to 1ml), then adjust amount added.&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the volume is far higher, then discard the cassette and use new cassettes.&nbsp;The plates are made of plastic that is heat sensitive and will deform if washed in a dishwasher (at high temperatures), placed in drying cabinet for an extended period of time, or if the gel is run at a too high voltage.&nbsp;If treated properly, cassettes can be reused at least 10 times.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Leakage occurs when buffer is added to top reservoir of gel</strong>: </p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the gels are not stored in a moist environment, the agarose and SDS-PAGE gel may partially dry out and shrink, which will lead to a slight separation of the gel from the plate(s), that may cause leakage from the top reservoir.&nbsp;This can be avoided by ensuring poured gels are stored with moist paper towels and are tightly sealed with plastic film, also avoid using gels past 2 weeks of age.&nbsp;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>If leakage does occur: </strong>&nbsp;Cut off the end of a 200&nbsp;µL pipette tip (Figure 9A) and insert it between the back cassette plate and the adjacent wall of the electrophoresis unit as shown in Figures 9B, 9C.&nbsp;For further clarification of the positioning of the tips, see the top view (Figure 9D) and the view from the front of the cassette (Figure 9E).&nbsp;This tip will press the plates against the opposing wall of the electrophoresis unit, thereby pressing the plates firmly together.&nbsp;Do ensure that the cut-off tip-end is short enough so that the lid of the gel apparatus can still be securely closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>Assembly of the cassette:  less than 15
