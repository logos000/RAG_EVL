The monosaccharide composition analysis is subsequently obtained by a traditional HPLC method that separates and quantifies all 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP)-labeled monosaccharides in 10 μl serum in 55 minutes. The described workflow takes approximately 2 days, up to 26 serum samples can be analyzed with one HPLC instrument per day. Each step of the experimental procedures has been optimized with repeated tests of monosaccharide standards and serum samples.&nbsp;</p><br>Keywords: serum, plasma, glycan, ampule-sealed acidolysis, 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP), derivatization, HPLC, monosaccharide compositions<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>	Glycans are abundantly present in tissues and blood circulation in the form of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Glycome is estimated to be 10<sup>4</sup> times larger than the proteome[1-4]. Glycan biosynthesis has no templates and its structures are influenced by genes, nutrition, and other environmental factors in time and space[5]. Over 125 congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) discovered in humans are associated with multi-systems disfunctions [6]. It has been well documented that total serum <em>O-</em> or <em>N-</em>glycans are different among healthy individuals and patients suffering different type of cancers [7-10]. Thus, abnormal glycan structures are common features for both inherited and environment-related diseases. </p><p>	Indeed, most clinically used cancer biomarkers established during the past 40 years are either specific glycan structures or glycoproteins [11, 12]. However, these clinically used cancer biomarkers have low sensitivity and specificity as biomarkers [13] due to limited glycan information content [11]. In contrast, current glycomics approaches depend on profiling complicated glycan structures, which are technically difficult for clinical applications [14, 15]. </p><p>	Despite there are many different types of glycans [11], all human glycans consist of up to 10 monosaccharides, i.e. sialic acid, N-acetyl galactosamine, N-acetyl glucosamine, galactose, mannose, fucose, glucose, xylose, glucuronic acid, and iduronic acid. However, few methods have been developed to quantify glycan contents or monosaccharide compositions in human sera or plasmas for biomarker development.</p><p>	This protocol was originally developed from the corresponding author’s laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis for glucosamine- and galactosamine-based, serum- or animal tissue-derived glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification purposes [16-20]. We then discovered that significantly different quantity and compositions of glucosamine and galactosamine are present in the plasmas of human patients suffering lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers, respectively, [17, 21]. Since the major glycans in human sera/plasmas are N-linked and O-linked glycans instead of GAGs, we subsequently developed a HPLC method that can quantify all other monosaccharides in addition to glucosamine and galactosamine released from serum/plasma glycans simultaneously[22-25] for biomarker development. </p><p>	Releasing monosaccharides from glycans is the bottleneck of monosaccharide composition analysis[26, 27]. The conventional hydrolysis assay for releasing monosaccharides from glycans of either plant or animal origin is conducted in a sealed glass ampoule at 105–120 ◦C for 1–6 h [27, 28] or in a PicoTag station[17]. Thus, we have optimized the ampule-sealed acidolysis assay for human serum or plasma analysis. The monosaccharide compositions are then obtained by PMP-labeling and HPLC analysis.&nbsp;</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>Ultrapure water (Simplicity UV Ultrapure water preparation system, MILLIPORE, Germany)</p><p>High-purity water (AQUELIX high-purity water preparation system, MILLIPORE, Germany)</p><p>PMP (1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone, Analytical pure, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p>Methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH, Chromatographic pure, Merck)</p><p>Acetonitrile (HCN, Chromatographically pure, Merck)</p><p>Glycerol (Tianjin Komeo Chemical Reagent)</p><p>Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, Analytical pure, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent)</p><p>Hydrochloric acid (HCl, Analytical pure, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent)</p><p>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Analytical pure, Sinopharm Chemical reagent)</p><p>Chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>, Tianjin Kemeou Chemical Reagent)</p><p>Acetic acid (HAc, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent)</p><p>Ammonium acetate (NH<sub>4</sub>Ac, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent)</p><p>Anhydrous ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH, Tianjin Kemeou Chemical Reagent)</p><p>Glucose (Glc, 99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p>Mannose (Man; 99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p>Fucose (Fuc; 99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p>Galactose (Gal; 99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p>Glucosamine (GlN; 99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p>Xylose (Xyl; 99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p>Galactosamine (GalN; 99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p>Glucuronic acid (GlcA; 99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p>Rhamnose (Rha; 99% purity, Sigma Aldrich, USA)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>REAGENT SETUP</strong></p><p><strong>Sera</strong> Each serum sample is stored at -80<sup>o</sup>C before use. </p><p><strong>PMP derivative reagent </strong>Weigh the correct amount of PMP powder and dissolve in methanol to form 0.5 M PMP derivative reagent.

After hydrolysis, 8 out of 10 monosaccharides, including galactosamine (GalN), galactose (Gal), glucosamine (GlcN), glucose (Glc), mannose (Man), fucose (Fuc), xylose (Xyl), glucuronic acid (GlcA) could be detected by the PMP-derivatization and HPLC separation and detection method. Human fasting blood has no detectable rhamnose (Rha).
