The virus, proven to be very contagious, infected more than 9 million people worldwide (in June 2020). Nevertheless, it is not clear the role of air pollution and meteorological conditions on virus transmission. In this study, we quantitatively assessed how the meteorological and air quality parameters are correlated to the Covid-19 transmission in Lombardy (Northern Italy), the region epicenter of the virus outbreak. Our main findings highlight that temperature and humidity related variables are negatively correlated to the virus transmission, whereas air pollution (PM2.5) shows a positive correlation. In other words, Covid-19 pandemic transmission prefers dry and cool environmental conditions, as well as polluted air. For these reasons, the virus might easier spread in unfiltered air-conditioned environments. Those results will be supporting decision makers to contain new possible outbreaks.</p><br>Keywords: Covid-19, Sars-CoV-2, air pollution, meteorology, correlation, pandemic<br><h2>Procedure</h2><p>1.&nbsp;Calculate the Absolute Humidity and Water Vapor concentration using the Relative Humidity, Temperature,</p><p> and Pressure variables from data. </p><p>2.&nbsp;Use the MATLAB function [rho<em>,pval] = corr(X, Y, 'Type', 'Spearman') </em>and compute the Spearman rank correlation (rho).
