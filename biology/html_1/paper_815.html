See attached supplementary documentation. </p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>See attached pdf file for detailed information on media</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>See attached pdf file for detailed information on equipments needed</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p>1. Sperm is either thawed from a cryopreserved stock or extracted fresh from the cauda epipidymis of the male mouse and incubated for 30 min. at 37 °C in TYH medium.</p><p><br></p><p>2. Cumuli containing oocytes are transferred to a 90 µL HTF medium drop on a petri dish, covered by mineral oil (NidOil).</p><p><br></p><p>3. 10 µl sperm suspension are added to the HTF drop and the IVF dish is incubated at 37 °C for 4-5 hours. Afterwards, fertilization is assessed by second polar body formation.</p><p><br></p><p>4. Sperm thawing and IVF procedures as well as TYH and HTF media preparation are performed according to the protocols described at</p><p><a href="https://www.infrafrontier.eu/knowledgebase/protocols/cryopreservation-protocols" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.infrafrontier.eu/knowledgebase/protocols/cryopreservation-protocols</a></p><p><br></p><p>5. Following successful IVF, the zygotes are supplemented with fresh KSOM Embryomax media everyday until E5.5</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>cautionary notes are placed wherever necessary in the protocol. </p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>2 hours from the time of oocyte isolation</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>Successful fertilization of mouse oocytes resulting in healthy embryos</p><h2>References</h2><p>Takeo T, Nakagata N.Reduced glutathione enhances fertility of frozen/thawed C57BL/6 mouse sperm after exposure to methyl-beta-cyclodextrin.
