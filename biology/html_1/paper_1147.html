Colas, Esteban A Gomez, Jesmond Dalli<br>Abstract: <p>Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a sensitive and robust approach for the identification and quantitation of lipid mediators including the specialized pro-resolving mediators (resolvins, maresins, protectins and lipoxins), and the classic eicosanoids. Due to the relatively low concentration of these molecules in biological samples, this methodology is classically coupled with solid phase extraction (SPE) techniques that enhance the sensitivity of the assay. Herein, we provide a step-by-step description of instrumentation employed in the both SPE and LC-MS/MS and detailed methodologies employed in the extraction of these lipid mediators and their identification and quantitation using LC-MS/MS.</p><p><br></p><br>Keywords: Lipid mediator profiling, flux analysis, eicosanoids, resolvins, protectins, maresins, SPE, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.<br><h2>Introduction</h2>Lipid mediators play a central role in the regulation of a whole range of biological functions in both in humans and experimental systems <sup>1, 2, 3, 4</sup>. These molecules are produced in a range of organs and tissues at concentrations that are commensurate with their biological actions, which in large part are dictated by the affinity of these molecules to their cognate receptors. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) represents a robust and highly sensitive approach for both the identification and quantitation of these potent autacoids since chromatography allows for the separation of isobaric molecules as well as double bond and chiral isomers. Mass spectrometry captures information on the fragmentation profile of the molecules of interest, which coupled with the retention time of the molecule in liquid chromatography provides a fingerprint for the identification of these molecules. In addition, LC-MS/MS allows for the simultaneous monitoring of tens and sometimes hundreds of molecules providing a snapshot of a number of dynamic pathways and the flux down each of these bioactive pathways.&nbsp;Herein, we shall review the protocols employed to obtain a snapshot of the dynamic pathways for the four major bioactive metabolomes that include the arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, n-3 docosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid metabolomes <sup>5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12</sup>. These approaches help providing insights into mechanisms activated during inflammation as well as new leads into underlying causes of disease by measuring the flux down each of the major bioactive metabolomes <sup>5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</sup>. Given that the production and many of the biological actions of these mediators are conserved throughout evolution, these methodologies are applicable to biological material from experimental systems such as tunicates <sup>13</sup>, mice <sup>5, 7</sup> and baboons <sup>9</sup> as well as humans <sup>6, 8, 11, 14, 15</sup>. Thus, these methodologies facilitate the direct translation of findings made in experimental systems to humans and <em>vice versa</em>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><br></p><p>- Optima HPLC grade methanol (Fisherbrand)</p><p>- Hydrochloric acid 37% (Sigma)</p><p>- n-hexane HPLC grade ≥95% (Fisherbrand)</p><p>- Methyl formate 98% for spectrometry (Acros organic)</p><p>- Acetic acid trace select ultra for ultratrace analysis ≥99% (Honeywell)</p><p>- Ultrapure distilled water (Milli-Q system coupled with Q-pod and Biopack polisher cartridge)</p><p>- Individual lipid mediators (LM) (Cayman Chemicals, Vinresol Ltd)</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><u>Reagent preparation</u></p><p><em>Acidified water for SPE extraction:</em></p><p>- Acidify 2.5 L of water with HCl (4N) to pH 3.5</p><p>- Mix well</p><p>- Verify pH with pH meter</p><p>- Adjust pH if necessary</p><p><em>Acidified water for liquid chromatography 0.01% acetic acid:</em></p><p>- Take 2.5 L of water</p><p>- Add 250 µL of acetic acid using a glass pipet</p><p>- Mix well</p><p><em>Acidified water for liquid chromatography 0.5% acetic acid:</em></p><p>- Take 2.5 L of water</p><p>- Add 12.5 mL of acetic acid using a glass pipet</p><p>- Mix well</p><p><em>Acidified methanol for liquid chromatography 0.01% acetic acid:</em></p><p>- Take 2.5 L of methanol</p><p>- Add 250 µL of acetic acid using a glass pipet</p><p>- Mix well</p><p><em>Acidified methanol for liquid chromatography 0.5% acetic acid:</em></p><p>- Take 2.5 L of methanol</p><p>- Add 12.5 mL of acetic acid using a glass pipet</p><p>- Mix well</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Equipment</h2><p><br></p><p>- TurboVap LV (Biotage)</p><p>- Centrifuge SL16R (Thermoscientific)</p><p>- Microcentrifuge Fresco17 (Thermoscientific)</p><p>- pH meter FiveEasy (Mettler Toledo)</p><p>- Vortex (Fisherbrand)</p><p>- Falcon 15 mL conical tube (Fisher Scientific)</p><p>- 1.5 mL natural flat cap microcentrifuge tube (StarLab)</p><p>- Silanized amber target SC I-D vial 12 x 32 (Thermoscientific)</p><p>- Target cap and tst septa (Thermoscientific)</p><p>- 300 µ L target polyspring insert mandrel point (Thermoscientific)</p><p>- Round bottom borosilicate glass tubes 16x100 mm (Fisherbrand)</p><p>- Glass pipette (1 and 10 mL)</p><p>- Bulb</p><p>- Glass pasteur pipette (Corning)&nbsp;</p><p>- Ice machine</p><p>- -20<sup>o</sup>C Freezer</p><p>- Extrahera (Biotage)</p><p>- Disposable tips 1000 µL clear (Biotage)</p><p>- Fisher TT 12 x 75 boro 3.3 with rim (Fisherbrand)</p><p>- SIL-20AC autoinjector (Shimadzu)</p><p>- LC-20AD HPLC (Shimadzu)</p><p>- CTO-20AC oven (Shimadzu)</p><p>- Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (100 mm x 4.6 mm x 2.7 µm) (Agilent)</p><p>- Chiralpak AD-RH column (150 mm × 2.1 mm × 5 μm) (Hichrom limited)</p><p>- QTrap 5500 (Sciex)</p><p>- QTrap 6500+ (Sciex)</p><p>- Nitrogen gas generator Genius 3031 (Peak Scientific)</p><p>- Nitrogen gas generator ABN2ZA (Peak Scientific<a href="https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/article/pex-1147/private/draft#_msocom_1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[CJ1]</a>&nbsp;)</p><p>- ISOLUTE C18 SPE cartridge 500mg/3mL (Biotage)</p><p>- Analyst software 1.6.3</p><p><br></p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>See Figure 1 for schematic representation</strong></p><p><u>Sample collection and storage:</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood was collected with anti-coagulant for plasma and centrifuged human peripheral blood at 1500 x g for 10 min at room temperature</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect plasma</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Store at -80ºC until analysis</p><p><br></p><p><u>Protein precipitation:</u></p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow the sample to gently thaw on ice</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare methanol containing internal standard (methanol-IS;
