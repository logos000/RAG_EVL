Pluripotent stem cell-based&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>approaches aiming to recapitulate distinct aspects of this core developmental process have recently been reported, including our recent paper on the&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>recapitulation of the human segmentation clock<sup>1</sup>. Here we describe in detail our stepwise induction protocol of presomitic mesoderm (PSM), somitic mesoderm (SM), and its two major derivatives, sclerotome (SCL) and dermomyotome (DM) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We further briefly address the subsequent molecular and functional analysis of these&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>induced human mesodermal lineages and cell-types.&nbsp;</p><br>Keywords: in vitro differentiation, human mesoderm development, induced pluripotent stem cells, somitogenesis <br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Mesoderm, one of the three principal germ layers is formed and specified in the primitive streak (PS) during early embryonic development. The primitive streak is the anatomical correlate of gastrulation, a process during which the pluripotent cells of the epiblast undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and give rise to mesoderm and definitive endoderm. Paraxial or presomitic mesoderm is one the mesodermal lineages which are formed and specified along the anterior-posterior axis of the primitive streak.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During somitogenesis these presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells then give rise to somites, transiently epithelialized balls of somitic mesoderm (SM), which further differentiate into the two major somite compartments, sclerotome (SCL) and dermomyotome (DM) respectively. Somitic mesoderm and its derivatives contribute to the formation and patterning of the musculoskeletal system, giving rise to vertebrae, ribs and skeletal muscle. This entire process has been extensively studied using model organisms such as chick, mouse or zebrafish but remains largely elusive in the human context. This also applies to studies focusing on the segmentation clock, a species-specific molecular oscillator believed to control the process of somitogenesis.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to gain insights into human somitogenesis, we and others have recently established induction protocols and approaches for the reproducible&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>derivation of presomitic and somitic mesoderm-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells<sup>1-6</sup>. Molecular and functional analysis of these&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>derived human presomitic and somitic mesoderm-like cells and their derivatives have increased our understanding of this core developmental process in human.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Nature Protocol Exchange is an addition to our recent paper on the&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>recapitulation of the human segmentation clock from pluripotent stem cells, and describes in detail the stepwise induction of presomitic and somitic mesoderm and its derivatives from human iPSCs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>0.5%-Trypan blue stain solution (Nacalai, Cat#: 29853-34)</p><p>0.5 mmol/l-EDTA/PBS solution (Nacalai, Cat#: 13567-84)</p><p>1-Thioglycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#:

(feeder-free)</u></strong></p><p>The here described induction and differentiation conditions are based on the feeder-free attachment (2D) culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 201B7<sup>7 </sup>and 1231A3<sup>8 </sup>on laminin-coated (iMatrix-511 silk, Nippi) sterile cell culture dishes with StemFit<sup>®</sup>AK02N (Reprocell) being the iPSC-culture and maintenance medium of choice. Stable culture of fully reprogramed high-quality human iPSCs is necessary for subsequent successful differentiation steps and efficient induction of mesodermal cell types described in this protocol exchange. The here defined culture and differentiation conditions are compatible with and can be applied to other high-quality human iPSC-lines (e.g. 428C2)<sup>9</sup>. Please note that for human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and pluripotent stem cells of other species culture conditions may need to be optimized.</p><p>The here exemplified culture and differentiation conditions are for single-cell dissociation and culture of human iPSCs in a laminin-coated 6 well culture plate. Please adjust initial seeding densities and volumes of culture (maintenance) media according to the sterile cell culture plates and dishes utilized for initial feeder-free iPSC culture (see Table 1 for details).</p><p><br></p><p><u>1.1 Coating of cell culture dishes &amp; plates for feeder-free iPSC culture</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Described conditions are for a sterile 6 well culture plate but can be adjusted to other culture plates and dishes accordingly. (see Table 1 for details)</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 1.5 ml of PBS containing iMatrix-511 silk (0.5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup>) into each well of a 6 well sterile culture plate. Other Laminin-511 fragment sources/types such as iMatrix-511 (Nippi, Cat# 892012) can be also used.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incubate the plate with coating agent either for &gt;1 hour at 37°C, for &gt;3 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Usually coating is performed overnight at 4°C.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 750 µl (or half the volume of initial iMatrix-511 solution) of StemFit<sup>®</sup>AK02N and mix thoroughly.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the medium and add 1.5 ml of StemFit<sup>®</sup>AK02N containing Y-27632 (10 µM). Place plate into humidified CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator at 37°C. Do not let the plate dry out when changing solutions.</p><p><br></p><p><u>1.2 Passaging of human feeder-free iPSCs</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare ~ 80% confluent culture of human feeder-free iPSCs.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the culture medium.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash the iPS cell colonies with PBS.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 300 µl of 0.5x TrypLE<sup>TM </sup>Select enzyme solution (diluted with 0.5 mmol/l-EDTA/PBS); distribute it evenly, and put the plate into a humidified CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator set to 37°C.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 1 minute, take out the plate and re-distribute TrypLE<sup>TM </sup>Select enzyme solution and put it back into the incubator (for another 3 minutes).</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take out the plate and observe the cells under the microscope whether they have started separating/detaching; if not, incubate for another 30 seconds to 1 minute.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the solution and wash with PBS gently.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate PBS and add 1 ml of StemFit<sup>®</sup>AK02N with Y-27632 (10 µM).</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harvest cells with cell scraper into a 1.5 ml microtube.</p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissociate the collected cells gently by pipetting up and down ~ 10 times (using 1,000 µl tip) and measure cell density.&nbsp;</p><p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seed 1.3x10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well onto iMatrix-511 silk-coated 6 well culture plate containing pre-warmed medium (for other plates or dishes see Table 1).</p><p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribute cells evenly by gentle shaking and incubate plate with cells in humidified CO<sub>2</sub>incubator at 37°C.</p><p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next day, change the medium to StemFit<sup>®</sup>AK02N without Y-27632.</p><p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Change medium every other day unless the medium color turns yellow or iPSCs start to prematurely differentiate; if so, change the medium every day.</p><p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;Passage once every week.</p><p><br></p><p><u>1.3 Preparing freezing stocks of feeder-free iPSCs</u></p><p>Initial steps are same with the procedure for passaging until step 10.</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer the required number of cells collected from the culture plate or dish into a 1.5 ml microtube and centrifuge (800 rpm, 22°C, 5 minutes).&nbsp;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells with Stem-cellbanker (Takara) (1.0x10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml).</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 200 µl of cell suspension (2.0x10<sup>5 </sup>cells) into cryogenic tube (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freeze vials in&nbsp;pre-cooled freezing container&nbsp;at -80°C for overnight.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next day, transfer frozen vials into a liquid nitrogen tank.</p><p><br></p><p><u>1.4 Thawing and culture of frozen feeder-free iPSC stocks</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set water bath to 37°C.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 5 ml of StemFit<sup>®</sup>AK02N with Y-27632 (10 µM) into a 15 ml tube.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaw a frozen vial of iPSCs in the water bath until only a few small ice particles remain.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer the cells into a 15 ml tube and centrifuge (800 rpm, 22°C, 5 minutes).</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the supernatant and add 500 µl of StemFit<sup>®</sup>AK02N with Y-27632.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissociate the cells gently by pipetting (about 10 times) and measure the cell density using hemocytometer or automated cell counter.&nbsp;</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seed 1.3x10<sup>4 </sup>single cells/well onto laminin-coated 6 well culture plate. Make sure that viability of cells is high and seed&nbsp;appropriate number of living cells&nbsp;into utilized culture plates or dishes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>2) Stepwise induction of human somitic mesoderm and its major derivatives</u></strong></p><p>Feeder-free cultured human iPSCs are utilized for stepwise somitic mesoderm induction at day 5 post single-cell dissociation and culture. Human iPSC colonies should be clearly visible and the condition of cells should be excellent without presence of prematurely differentiating cells in the culture. For all here described differentiation and induction conditions of human somitic mesoderm and its derivatives a chemically defined medium (CDM)<sup>10 </sup>is used as base medium. Composition of the utilized CDM is described in Table 2. All growth factors and small molecules necessary at each induction step should be added to CDM just before use of media. A master mix of the required induction media can be made and distributed into each well/dish as needed. Exemplified induction protocols are based on culture of human iPSCs in a 6 well sterile culture plate. Necessary minimal media volumes for different plates or dishes are described in Table 3. Our stepwise somitic mesoderm induction protocol is similar to a recent published protocol, albeit with some differences<sup>4</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>2.1 Preparation of Chemically Defined Medium (CDM)</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform all described steps under a clean-bench; use sterile tips and bottles (see Table 2 for composition of CDM).</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dissolve bovine serum albumin (BSA) (10 mg/ml) in Ham’s F-12 Nutrient Mix (F12) and add Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S) (100 unit/100 µg/ml).</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass dissolved mixture through filter bottle (0.22 µm).</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix filtered BSA and P/S containing F12 medium with IMDM (1:1).</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add sterile reconstituted Apo-transferrin (15 µg/ml), 1-Thioglycerol (450 µM), CD Lipid (1%) and rh-Insulin (7 µg/ml) and store at 4°C until use. Concentrations given in brackets are the&nbsp;final concentrations at the time of adding components. CDM should be used up within two weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>2.2 Primitive Streak (PS) induction</u></p><p>PS cells are induced via activation of FGF, WNT and TGFβ signaling pathways in human feeder-free cultured iPSCs. Adjust induction media volumes to utilized type of dishes or plates (Table 3).</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare PS induction medium by adding CHIR99021 (10 µM), rh-Activin A (50 ng/ml) and rh-bFGF (20 ng/ml) to CDM. See Table 4 for details. Usually a master mix of the required induction medium is made and distributed into each well or dish as needed to reduce pipetting errors and well-to-well variability.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to induction of PS cells, iPSCs are cultured in humidified CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator on laminin-coated plates for 5 days from initial seeding of iPSCs at single cell level. At time of induction clear epithelial colonies of iPSCs have formed and are visible under the microscope. If iPSC conditions are not good (e.g. many spontaneously differentiated cells are present or colony sizes/shapes are unusual) do not use cells for induction.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the maintenance medium (StemFit<sup>®</sup>AK02N).</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 2 ml of PS induction medium into each well (for volume of induction medium to be added when using other plates or dishes see Table 3).</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culture iPSCs in PS induction medium at 37°C for 24 hours in humidified CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use induced PS cells for subsequent differentiation into human presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells; use PS cells for characterization and quality control (i.e. RNA and protein isolation, immunocytochemistry, FACS and quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) etc.).</p><p><br></p><p><u>2.3 Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM) induction</u></p><p>PSM cells are induced from human iPSC-derived primitive streak (PS) cells (for details on how to induce PS cells see 2.2). Our PSM induction protocol is similar to a recent published protocol, albeit with some differences<sup>4</sup>. Other protocols aiming to induce presomitic mesoderm from human pluripotent stem cells (hESCs or hiPSCs) have also been reported<sup>2,3,5,6</sup>. Following the 24 hours of initial PS induction, induce PSM cells by simultaneous activation of WNT and FGF signaling and inhibition of TGFβ and BMP signaling pathways.&nbsp;</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare PSM induction medium by adding CHIR99021 (3 µM), LDN193189 (250 nM), rh-bFGF (20 ng/ml) and SB431542 (10 µM) to CDM. See Table 5 for details on components of the PSM induction medium. Usually a master mix of the required induction medium is made and distributed into each well or dish as needed to reduce pipetting errors and well-to-well variability.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate previous (PS) induction medium.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 2 ml of freshly made PSM induction medium.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culture cells in humidified CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>incubator at 37°C for 24 hours.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use induced PSM cells for subsequent differentiation into human somitic mesoderm (SM) cells or analysis of&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>features of induced PSM cells including e.g. oscillatory expression of segmentation clock genes. For details on measurement and visualization of oscillatory expression of segmentation clock genes in&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>induced human PSM cells see our concurrent paper in Nature and related recent papers by other groups<sup>2</sup>. In case of bioluminescent measurement of oscillatory gene activity,&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>induced PSM cells derived from a luciferase-reporter line of e.g. human&nbsp;<em>HES7 </em>are cultured in CDM-based PSM medium containing D-luciferin (BMS). The presence of bioluminescent activity is measured using a luminometer set-up which allows extended culture of PSM cells&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>(Atto). The here described PSM induction approach can also be used to measure and visualize oscillatory activity in other human and non-human pluripotent stem cells, but may require further adjustments and optimization of the culture conditions e.g. adjustment of the level of WNT activity during&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>culture. Other human&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>PSM induction protocols can also be used to characterize aspects of the&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>human segmentation clock<sup>2,11</sup>. Already described in our concurrent paper<sup>1</sup>, stepwise&nbsp;<em>in vitro </em>induced PSM cells can be utilized for further molecular characterization and functional analysis as well as quality control e.g. RNA and protein isolation, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometric (FACS) analysis and quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR).
