GlpD calalyzes the oxidation of Glycerin-3-phosphate (G3P) to dihydroxyacetone-phosphate (DHAP). The oxidation is coupled to the reduction of the artificial yellow substrate tetrazol-3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromid (MTT) to a blue-violet formazan, which is mediated by the electron carrier phenazin-methanosulfate (PMS). This leads to an increase in absorption at 570 nm, which is measured to quantify the GlpD activity. To avoid background, it is best to use an <em>E. coli</em> strain with a deletion of the chromosomal <em>glpD</em> gene, which is available e.g. at the Keio collection [2]. The <em>glpD</em> gene can be used for transcriptional fusions, e.g. to characterize promoters, and also for translational fusions, e.g. to study translational regulation. The assay was adapted to the microtiter plate format to enable the parallel handling of a large number of samples. The “procedure” (see below) describes an application with the <em>glpD</em> gene in a translational fusion with the gene of interest cloned under the control of the inducible arabinose promoter P<sub>BAD</sub>.</p><br>Keywords: Escherichia coli, reporter gene, glpD, enzyme assay<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Reporter genes are valuable tools for the analysis of differential gene expression [1, 2]. The encoded reporter enzymes are typically small monomeric enzymes that fold with high efficiency in the cytoplasm of various species and that can be quantified with enzymatic assays that are robust, sensitive, and cheap. Transcriptional fusions are used to study promoter activities or/and transcript stabilities. Translational fusions further report on (differential) translational efficiencies and on protein stabilities. Widely used reporter genes include the <em>lacZ</em> gene encoding beta-galactosidase gene, the <em>gusA</em> gene encoding beta-glucuronidase, and the CAT gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The <em>gfp</em> gene encoding the Green Fluorescent Protein (and many derivatives thereof) is often used not as a reporter for the quantity of a protein of interest, but of its localization within cells or tissues or of its <em>in vivo</em> interaction with other proteins. Another, recently introduced reporter gene is <em>glpD</em>, which encodes glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [3]. Here, we describe the application of the <em>glpD</em> reporter gene for quantifying translational efficiencies in <em>E. coli</em>. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% (w/v) arabinose</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1M Tris-HCl pH 7.4</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GlpD lysis buffer: 50mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 500mM NaCl, 0.4% (v/v) Triton X 100, pH 8.0</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTT stock solution: 11.25mM MTT in H<sub>2</sub>O bidest. stored at 4°C, protected from light</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PMS stock solution: 56.3mM PMS in H<sub>2</sub>O bidest. stored at 4°C, protected from light</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sn-G3P stock solution: 78mg/mL sn-G3P in 0.1M Tris-HCl pH 7.4, prepared freshly</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Triton X 100</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glpD reaction buffer, generated from the stock solutions described above: 1.125mM MTT, 5.63mM PMS, 84mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.4% (v/v) Triton X 100, 7,8mg/mL sn-G3P</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microtiter plate (MTP) photometer</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96 well microtiter plates</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierce<sup>TM</sup> BCA Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific)</p><p><br></p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><u>Cell culture and harvesting</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inoculate 50 mL medium in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with plasmid-containing overnight cultures to an inital OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05.

Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used to generate a standard curve, using concentrations form 0 mg/ml to 2 mg/ml. The colorimetric biuret-reaction results in the formation of a blue color, which can be quantified photometrically at 562 nm. The BSA standard curve is used to calculate the protein concentrations of all samples (mg/ml).</p><p>13.&nbsp;The specific GlpD activity [U/mg] is calculated by dividing the volume activity [U/ml] with the protein concentration [mg/ml].</p><h2>References</h2><p>[1] T.
