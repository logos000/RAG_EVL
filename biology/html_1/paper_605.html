The toolkit employed by cells to overcome the damage and restore DNA integrity is made of a large collection of sensors and effector molecules and is broadly known as the DNA damage response (DDR, 1). Different types of DNA damage can occur, creating single or double-strand breaks in the DNA molecule (SSB and DSB, respectively). The comet assay has been established long ago for the determination of DNA strand breaks, both SSB and DSB, with the possibility of quantification of the extent of the damage using appropriate sofware packages (reviewed in 2).</p><p>Innate immunity is the first line of defense in cells against invading microorganisms and innate responsive cells such as monocytes and the differentiated effector cells, macrophages, are capable of orchestrating responses to fight pathogens (3). Innate imune responses closely associate with DNA damage, both leading to inflammation, but also to beneficial disease tolerance pathways (reviewed in 4).</p><p>Here we introduce the alkaline comet assay in the human monocytic cell line THP-1. This type of assay is suitable for the quantification of SSBs and DSBs in a manner that is reproducible, accurate and that can be achieved without the need for complicated equipement and in a time frame that extends for no longer than one week.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Cell culture</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THP-1 cell line, ATCC, catalog number TIB-202</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RPMI 1640 medium and supplements, all from GIBCO, ThermoFisher Scientific:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RPMI medium was supplemented with 10% (v/v) of FBS, 1% (v/v) of penicilin-streptomycin, 1% (v/v) of pyruvate, 1% (v/v) of non-essential aminoacids, 1% (v/v) hepes bufffer and 0.05M of 2-mercaptoethnol</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etoposide, Merck, catalog number E1383</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Comet assay</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CometAssay Kit (25 x 2 well slides), Trevigen, catalog number&nbsp;4250-050-K</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain, Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, catalog number&nbsp;S7580</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PBS buffer</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TE buffer pH 7.5</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ethanol 70% (v/v)</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NaOH solution&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDTA solution 500mM pH 8</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lysis solution</strong></p><p><strong>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alkaline unwinding solution pH&gt;13 (200mM NaOH;

If a range of concentrations and incubation times does not lead to an increase in damage, then it can be concluded hat the comopound does not induce to DNA damage in the tested cells.</p><p>If, on the other hand, the DNA damage is too high compared with previously observed results, make sure the control untreated sample is not already damaged before the treatment. Also, make sure that the agarose was not combined with the cells at a temperature capable of causing DNA damage.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Comet assay</strong></p><p>If there are no stained cells when observing at the microscope, confirm without fluorescence that the cells were not lost during any of the steps leading to the electrophoresis or after. If there are samples in the slide but those are not stained, repeat the staining with fresh Sybr Green.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Imaging and counting the comets</strong></p><p>If there is too much variability between replicates, increase the number of cells counted and ask another operator to also quantify the damage. If using automated systems, assay the same samples manually.</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>The times described are an approximation and refers to an assay using only 1 slide; scaling up the number of slides is expected to inclrese the time of the procedure.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cell culture&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Variable, depending on the kinetics of the incubation with the treatments; Usually, 1 day should be enough: cells are plated in the morning, the treatments are performed shortly after and last for up to 6h, after which the cells are collected.</p><p><strong>Comet assay</strong></p><p>3h are expected from the moment the solutions are prepared to the end of the electrophoresis.</p><p>Staining of the slide should last 1 h and the stained samples should then be used on the next day only.</p><p><strong>Imaging and counting the comets</strong></p><p>The time spent at the microscope varies considerably depending on the experience of the user, as it envolves sampling several different fields in the sample, chosing representative fields and taking pictures with as much focus as possible of a large number of cells. So, imaging is expected to take at least 3h, but the researcher may need to collect extra pictures if the initial analysis proves to be inconclusive.&nbsp;</p><p>If more pictures are necessary, another session at the microscope may be required a few days after the first session, possibly with the same duration.</p><p><strong>Comet score analysis</strong></p><p>The time required to analyze the population of cells depends of the type of software used, as some are have more automatic features than others. If done manually, the quantification is very labour intensive and requires many hours in front of the computer. Preferentially, more than one person should quantify the cell population and the results should then be compared.&nbsp;</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control non-treated samples are expected to show the basal levels of damage in the cell population;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Etoposide-treated cells are expected to show high levels of damage; this sample will possibly be the sample with the highest number of damaged cells but this will of course depend on the treatments used in the experiment;</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damage in the assayed samples can be quantified as a fraction of the etoposide-damaged cells, or a multiple of the untreated cells, as the experimental conditions are expected to have more damage than the control but less than the etoposide-treated samples.</p><h2>References</h2><p>1.
