Camper<br>Abstract: <p>The protocol details methods developed to optimize staining procedures and instrument settings for the rapid identification and unbiased enumeration of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) and viable-culturable (VC) cells as well as the membrane integrity of bacteria by flow cytometry (FCM). To detect viability, various Gram-negative bacteria were stained with numerous fluorescent membrane permeable (SYTO 9, SYTO 13, SYTO 17, SYTO 40) and impermeable (propidium iodide, PI) probes, and then quantified using the FCM. FCM data are then integrated with specific plate count results to calculate VC cells in different growth states. The cells were also exposed to heat (72<sup>° </sup>C) to monitor cellular membrane integrity. At late log phase (at 18 h incubation) of bacterial culture, the culturable, non-culturable and cells with damaged membranes varied from 40-98%, 1 to 64% and 0.7% to 4.5%, respectively. In this study, the cells with damaged cell membranes were considered dead (non-viable). This robust method preserves cell viability and takes a little more than an hour allowing the simultaneous quantification of phenotypes or cellular functions that is compatible with downstream cell-sorting and RNA-based assays.</p><br>Keywords: viable but non-culturable (VBNC), viable-culturable (VC), flow cytometry (FCM), fluorescent probes, cellular functions, rapid identification of bacterial viability, cell damage<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Evaluation of &nbsp;microbial viability is necessary in major&nbsp;microbiology sectors spanning from pharmaceutical discovery to global health; medicine and diagnostic to infectious diseases; biotechnology to food industry, water purification, wastewater treatment and downstream processing <sup>1</sup>. Major concerns related to culturing involve the frequent failure to recover intact metabolically active cells following physical, chemical or other environmental challenges including nutrient (starvation, selective deprivation), heat, pressure pH or salinity alterations<sup>2, 3</sup>. These bacteria cell populations are frequently defined as ‘viable but non-culturable’ (VBNC)<sup>4, 5</sup> due to the fact that when placed in the appropriate conditions, the cells can resuscitate to become culturable again<sup>6, 7</sup>. The conventional methods (substrate uptake as well as microbial respiration assays) that are routinely used to determine metabolic activities are insufficient to explicit distinguish alive from dead cells. This distinction is due to the variability of cell activity that can be below the detection threshold or false positive signals from irreversible not reproduced cells with active and detectable metabolic functional activity<sup>6, 8, 9</sup>. Furthermore, the appropriate assessment of cellular activities is a major concern in drug discovery for the designing and testing of different drug molecules towards microorganisms and mammalian cells targeting infections, cancer or other pathologies <sup>9-11</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detection of microbial indicators and pathogens by conventional culturing process suffers by numerical underestimation as the organisms suffer due to sublethal environmental injury, inefficiency of the microorganisms under investigation to absorb the necessary nutrients in the media, and an array of physiological factors and conditions with a toll in microbial culturability<sup>12, 13</sup>. Other major disadvantages of traditional culture methods include the time consuming nature of the procedures and the failure of the techniques to detect VBNC organisms<sup>4, 5, 14</sup>. Cell counts obtained through microscopic observation are attained relatively fast yet and limited due to the need for concentrate the samples to acquire a sufficient number of target cells, possible operator fatigue, interference from other compounds, and the inability to discriminate living bacteria. Although live/dead staining kits are often used for viability assessment<sup>15</sup>, they are not universally applicable due to the preferential exclusion of SYTO 9 from some bacteria<sup>1, 8</sup>. The variation of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) molecular-based techniques present limitations in the time needed to be completed when compared with the inhibitory effect of various substanes<sup>16-20</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FCM may be a better fit for the broad and specific needs of microbial enumeration by enabling rapid <em>in situ</em> analysis of single cells. FCM coupled with fluorescent coded viability kits (live/dead staining), is more informative as it yields quantitative as well as qualitative data <sup>4, 13, 14</sup>. The optrode has been used to enumerate the live and dead bacterial population where on-site measurement and analysis is required<sup>21</sup>; however, the optrode’s application and robustness are limited compared to that of FCM<sup>22</sup>. While FCM has been extensively used in the field of clinical research, recent adaptations for microbial cell analysis have promoted its applications in bacteriology and microbial ecology<sup>23</sup>. The benefits of FCM include the fact that thousands of cells can be sorted in a matter of seconds and that single cells may be selected based on their signals and sorted into tubes, onto slides, or onto agar plates. Various approaches for cell detection have been developed through the use of FCM, including the use of fluorogenic substrates, which can be lipophillic, nontoxic, uncharged, and nonfluorescent<sup>8</sup>. When taken up by viable cells, such fluorogenic substrates are hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to polar fluorescent products, which are then retained by cells with intact membranes<sup>1</sup>. Downsides to this technique are the requirement of highly polar products for retention by cells with intact membranes, and also the possibility that numerous microbial cells could be detected against a background of other bacteria or nonbacterial particles when FCM and specific fluorescently-labeled antibodies or oligonucleotides are combined<sup>24</sup>. Limitations of FCM still include the inability to distinguish between VBNC and viable-culturable (VC) cells<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed a robust method that is both effective and time-conserving to distinguish, identify, and estimate rapidly the proportions of viable, non-viable, viable-culturable, and viable-nonculturable states of four representative Gram-negative bacterial species at different growth and stressed conditions as indicated by membrane integrity. Most of the techniques developed by other investigators also did not provide exact time-line for the assay. We assumed in this assay that cells having intact membranes are viable and those with damaged membranes are dead or theoretically dead. Initially, a protocol for selecting the best probe was developed based on the sensitivity and signals emitted by the four bacterial species with intact membranes. These results were then compared with cells stained with propidium iodide (PI), used to detect the fraction of cells damaged by heat, and compared also to culturable cell numbers. In these cases, the FCM settings were optimized to minimize noise and signals from detritus. Liquid counting reference beads were used to convert the FCM events to the number of cells per unit volume at different physiological conditions.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>REAGENTS</strong></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em> 0157:H7: EPA strain 932. <strong>!

To obtain the total number of events in the cell region creates a one-dimensional histogram gate in the histogram for cells stained with a specific probe and create another one-dimensional histogram gate for the liquid counting bead region and display in a histogram. The cells and the bead regions should be separated and will not overlap if the setting in Table S1 is followed and optimized.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▲ <strong>CRITICAL STEP </strong>Record the same number of total events for all conditions.

TROUBLESHOOTING</strong></p><p>	▲ <strong>CRITICAL STEP </strong>It is highly recommended that prior to attempting this step, the users have significant experience in the DNA extraction, running agarose gels and imaging gels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>This robust method preserves cell viability and takes a little more than 60 min allowing the simultaneous quantification of phenotypes or cellular functions that is compatible with downstream cell-sorting and RNA-based assays.</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p><strong>ANTICIPATED RESULTS</strong></p><p>The premise of this experiment is to select appropriate fluorescent probes so that optimum excitation for accurate and unbiased identification of signals (emission) from stained cells at various physiological conditions is achieved<sup>1</sup>. FCM is used herein to enumerate the number of total (after staining with SYTO probes) and dead cells (after staining with PI). Plate counts using specific nutrient agar are used to obtain the culturable cell numbers. These three key values are used to enumerate the VBNC and VC cells (Table S2 in the supplemental material). During enumeration of total cells, an insignificant portion (0.5 to 4.5%) of cells was dead, indicating that damage to the cell membrane had occurred during the pure culture process.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SYTO 9 and SYTO 17 probes were the most preferential for <em>E. coli </em>0157:H7 during enumeration of total cells obtaining the highest number of viable and nonculturable cell counts. For <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>P. syringae</em>, and <em>S. enterica </em>serovar Typhimurium, SYTO 9 and SYTO 13 were the most optimum. The one-dimensional histogram gates, P1 and P2, were created, and cells in these regions were sorted using the high-throughput mode (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). The counting beads injected into the FCM with respective stained species are shown in gate P3 (<strong>Fig. 1c, f, i, and l</strong>). More than 36% of <em>E. coli</em> O157:H7 (<strong>Fig. 1a and b</strong>) from the log phase of pure cultures were nonculturable, and nearly 4% were found dead (see Table S2). For <em>P. aeruginosa</em> (<strong>Fig. 1d and e</strong>), multiple peaks indicate that cells were undergoing cell division when the samples were collected in log phase. Even in pure culture, 63 to 74% of total cells were nonculturable and more than 2% of cells were dead (see Table S2). In the case of <em>P. syringae</em> (<strong>Fig. 1g and h</strong>), 36 to 37% of total cells were nonculturable and a lower percentage (&lt; 2%) of cells were dead (see Table S2) when the samples were collected in log phase. <strong>Figures 1j and k</strong> show the histograms for <em>S. enterica</em> serovar Typhimurium where more culturable cells (69 to 99%) were identified and the proportion of dead cells was &lt; 1% (see Table S2) when the samples were collected in log phase. The differences between the percentages of culturable and nonculturable <em>S. enterica</em> serovar Typhimurium<em> </em>cells are significant and are due to the effect on membrane permeability of these probes for this organism.</p><p>	The agarose gel bands on the top of the histograms correspond to the abundance of sorted cells in those two regions. The material in the shoulder region (gate P1 in <strong>Fig. 1</strong>) was narrower and dimmer than that the extracted DNA from material sorted from the main histogram (gate P2 in <strong>Fig. 1</strong>) provided thicker and brighter bands. The sorted materials from gate P2 corresponds to the abundance of cells. This provides evidence that the sorting resulted in adequate separation of cells from debris, with band thickness and brightness directly proportional to the materials sorted from these regions and also to histogram width and peak intensity. According to the date using the optimal probes, 32 to 41% of cells were nonculturable having ~ 4% cells were dead. Therefore, even under ideal laboratory conditions in pure culture, only 60% of cells were cultured. In another observation<sup>1</sup>, the FCM count was more repeatable and had higher precision than the plate counts. It is also evident that different stains provided different counts and therefore, affected the ratios of VBNC to VC cells at certain physiological states. It was also concluded that there is no universal fluorescent probe available to stain all species efficiently for enumeration, although either SYTO 9 or SYTO 13 was most productive for the species evaluated. This illustrates the need to optimize dye selection for each species to achieve maximum enumeration. An important consideration was the use of probes that were retained by all cells (SYTO probes) vs. another stain that only labeled cells with compromised membranes (PI in this case). Although it is also common to establish a threshold on either side scatter (SS) or specific PMT for bacterial cells, the method described here reduced the interference of debris during cell counting and sorting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the observation of membrane integrity of cell after heat shock showed that PI positive cells increased rapidly during the first five minutes of heat inactivation; however the rate did not continue after this point. With an increase in the duration of heat exposure, the cells lost culturability and the rate was decreased with time. The rate of the loss of culturability was more than two logs in the first five minutes of heat inactivation. In terms of FCM analysis after heat shock, with the increase in duration of heat exposure, the intensity and height of peaks increased proving to be most noticeable within the first 5 min heat shock. The cells and counting reference beads are shown in one-dimensional gates P1 and P5 respectively (<strong>Fig. S1</strong> in the supplemental material). Emission wavelengths of PI positive cells and counting reference beads are separable; therefore, the histograms in gates P1 and P5 (<strong>Fig. S1</strong>) did not overlap. It was also observed that 1 to 4% of nonculturable cells after heat shock became culturable under these conditions. It has been highly argued that nonculturability of cells can be reversible<sup>6, 26, 27</sup>, and this is borne out by the present study. These values should not be taken as absolutes since the culturability or entry into the VBNC state by different bacteria varies from one species to another<sup>15, 27</sup> and also depends on the media, stress-type, and other growth conditions. This approach can be applied to identify membrane integrity and injury during heat inactivation of many other species, and may also be applied to enumerate injured cells and their morphology due to infections.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different chemical disinfectants and UV treatment used in many potable water treatment facilities may cause sublethal injury of some bacteria<sup>2</sup>, thereby rendering them nonculturable. A potential application of this FCM-based method after optimization would be to assess the number of viable and culturable or nonculturable bacteria during disinfection process. Most of the disinfection kinetic studies do not have strong corroboration with the VBCN and VC stages of the targeted cells. This proposed FCM-based approach will open the door for immense opportunities to develop more accurate kinetic studies with higher accuracy using various disinfectant candidates for different goals of the studies<sup>22</sup>. </p><p>	The techniques developed in this study identified these physiological states accurately and rapidly, and are free from background noise, which is a common problem for the FCM. The time required to analyze and count the cells using the FCM was less than 10 min after 60-min incubation of cells with dyes. Thus, a sample can be prepared and enumerated within 70 min. The FCM analysis was done using the BD FACSAria<sup>TM</sup>; however, the stepwise procedure discussed in this protocol can be adapted to the FCM of any brand following its own startup and initialization procedures before running the samples. Furthermore, the histogram gates, logics and sorting concept developed in this study also can simply be adopted in any high-throughput drug discovery assay. This protocol manuscript details the rapid enumeration and identification of each process of VBNC and VC stages at various growth and stress conditions with specific time-limit; and according to the best of our knowledge, there is no such protocol available to answer these critical and important roles of microbes in the fields of microbial ecology, environmental health, and medical microbiology, which was also revealed by the recent review articles<sup>16, 19, 20, 22, 26</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>References</h2><p><strong>CITATIONS</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Khan, M.M.T., Pyle, B.H. &amp; Camper, A.K.
