Gently shake the imaging dish to make sure cells are evenly spread. Keep the imaging dish at 37°C with 5% CO2 overnight.</p><p>Transfection</p><p>- On the next day, transfect U2OS cells. We suggest to determine the optimal amount of plasmid encoding (mNeonGreen)4-tDeg in the transfection. An optimal amount of (mNeonGreen)4-tDeg plasmid will give highest mRNA fluorescent puncta signal-to-noise ratio possible in fluorescence imaging. In our setup, we use 1.4 μg of miniCMV-(mNeonGreen)4-tDeg or 0.28 μg of UbC-(mNeonGreen)4-tDeg with 1.12 μg of pUC19 (as a diluent DNA) as the fluorogenic protein in the transfection. The amount of plasmid encoding (mNeonGreen)4-tDeg should be titrated and optimized case by case.</p><p>- For transfection, prepare a 1.7 ml tube for each imaging dish. To this tube, add 125 μl of Opti-MEM, 1.4 μg of mRNA reporter plasmids, an optimal amount of plasmid encoding (mNeonGreen)4-tDeg, and 9.6 μl of FuGENE® HD reagent. Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down, then incubate at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes.</p><p>- After incubation, add this mixture drop by drop to the imaging dish with cells. Keep the imaging dish under 37°C with 5% CO2 overnight.</p><p>- On the next day, prewarm 1xPBS and culture media.</p><p>- Aspirate culture media from the imaging dish, gently rinse cells with 1xPBS, aspirate 1xPBS, add 2 ml fresh culture media to cells. Culture cells under 37°C with 5% CO2 overnight.</p><p>Imaging</p><p>- Prior to live-cell imaging, prewarm 1xPBS, and imaging media (phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 of streptomycin, 1x GlutaMAX™, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate).</p><p>- Aspirate culture media from the imaging dish, gently rinse cells with 1xPBS, aspirate 1xPBS, add 2 ml of imaging media to the imaging dish.</p><p>- Move the imaging dish to the microscope in the prewarmed environmental chamber.</p><p>- Add sufficient immersion oil (N = 1.520) on a 100×/1.4-NA oil objective, and use this objective under phase illumination to focus on adhered cells.</p><p>- Switch from phase to fluorescence acquisition with FITC filter sets (with excitation filter 475 ± 14 nm, dichroic mirror with a reflection band of 481-502 nm, and a transmission band of 506-543 nm, and emission filter 525 ± 25 nm).</p><p>- Determine the proper exposure time by acquiring images with an exposure time between 50 ms to 200 ms. A proper exposure time will allow for highest possible signal without any pixel saturation.</p><p>- Set up software to acquire fluorescence images.</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>None.</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>~ four days</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>Pepper-tagged mRNAs were observed as fluorescent puncta, as shown in Figure 1.</p><h2>References</h2><p>None.</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>We thank the Bio-Imaging Resource Center at Rockefeller University for technical support.</p></body></html>
