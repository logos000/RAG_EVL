Together with depression and sleep difficulties, anxiety symptoms seem to be the most diffused clinical outcome. The current contribution aimed to examine attentional bias for virus-related stimuli in people varying in their degree of health anxiety (HA). Consistent with previous literature, it was hypothesized that higher HA would predict attentional bias, tested using a visual dot-probe task, to virus-related stimuli. Participants were 132 Italian individuals that participated in the study during the lockdown phase in Italy.&nbsp;Results indicated that the HA level predicts attentional bias toward virus-related objects. This relationship is double mediated by the belief of contagion and by the consequences of contagion as assessed through a recent questionnaire developed to measure the fear for COVID-19. These findings, indicative of attentional bias for virus-related cues, are discussed in the context of cognitive-behavioral conceptualizations of anxiety suggesting a risk for a loop effect. Future research directions are outlined.</p><br>Keywords: attentional bias, COVID-19, health anxiety<br><h2>Procedure</h2><p>1) select pictures of virus-related objects and neutral objects</p><p>2) create 40 pairs of virus-related and neutral objects (Test trials)</p><p>3) create 40 pairs of neutral and neutral objects (Filler trials)</p><p>4) create the visual dot probe task</p><p>5) collect data from the dot probe task</p><p>6) clean collected data by removing a) trials with incorrect response b) trials with reaction times &lt; 250 ms and &gt; 1000 ms</p><p>7) compute attentional bias by subtracting reaction times to congruent trials (target and probe in the same position) from reaction times to incongruent trials (target and probe in different position)</p><p>8) calculate health anxiety score</p><p>9) calculate fear for COVID-19 score (and its subfactors "belief of contagion" and "consequences of contagion")</p><p>10) perform double mediation model</p></body></html>
