Here, we established the protocol of the continuous patterning of hepatic, biliary and pancreatic structures from a three-dimensional culture of human pluripotent stem cell (PSC). The boundary interactions between anterior and posterior gut spheroids differentiated from human PSCs enables autonomous emergence of hepato-biliary-pancreatic (HBP) organ domains in the absence of extrinsic factor supply.<strong> </strong>This anterior-poterior gut interaction protocol can be used to model the early human HBP organogenesis process <em>in vitro</em>.</p><br>Keywords: organoid, organogenesis, pluripotent stem cell, human developmental biology, hepato-biliary-pancreatic organ<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The hepato-biliary-pancreatic (HBP) anlage, which is demarcated by HHEX (Hematopoietically-expressed homeobox protein) and PDX1 (Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1) expression is specified at the boundary between the foregut-midgut. </p><p>Here, we leverage a three-dimensional differentiation approach using human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to specify gut spheroids with distinct regional identities comprised of both endoderm and mesoderm. We show that antero-posterior interactions recapitulate the foregut and the midgut boundary <em>in vitro</em>, modeling the inter-coordinated specification and invagination in the human hepato-biliary-pancreatic organoid (HBPO).</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Cells</strong></p><p>·	Human pluripotent stem cells (for example H1 human embryonic stem cells, NIHhESC-10-0043)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reagents</strong></p><p>·	mTeSR1 (STEMCELL technologies, 85850)</p><p>·	Matrigel, Growth Factor Reduced (Corning Inc., 356231)</p><p>·	Matrigel, Phenol Red-free (Corning Inc., 356237)</p><p>·	Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A1110501)</p><p>·	Y-27632&nbsp;(Tocris Bioscience, 1254)</p><p>·	RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 22400089)</p><p>·	Activin A (R &amp; D Systems, 338-AC-01M)</p><p>·	FGF-4 (R &amp; D Systems, 235-F4-01M)</p><p>·	CHIR 99021 (Stemgent, 04-0004-10)</p><p>·	Defined fetal bovine serum (dFBS) (Hyclone Laboratories Inc, SH3007002)</p><p>·	Advanced DMEM/F-12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12634)</p><p>·	B27 Supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17504044)</p><p>·	N2 Supplement (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 17502048)</p><p>·	HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15630080)</p><p>·	L-Glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25030164)</p><p>·	Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15140122)</p><p>·	DPBS (for example Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14190250)</p><p>·	DMEM/F-12 (for example Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11330057)</p><p>·	BMP-4 (R &amp; D Systems, 314-BP-050)</p><p>·	Noggin (R &amp; D Systems, 6057-NG-100)</p><p>·	TrypLE Express (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12604021)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>·	Cell culture incubator (37°C, 5% CO2)</p><p>·	Refrigerated centrifuges for 15 ml and 1.5 ml tubes and&nbsp;multiwell plates&nbsp;</p><p>·	Biosafety cabinet</p><p>·	Mechanical Pipettes</p><p>·	Pipette controller</p><p>·	Sterile filter pipette tips</p><p>·	Sterile wide bore pipette tips</p><p>·	Sterile&nbsp;15 ml centrifuge tube (for example Corning Inc., 352095)</p><p>·	Sterile&nbsp;1.5 ml&nbsp;microcentrifuge tubes (for example Eppendorf, 0030120086)</p><p>·	96-well Round Bottom Ultra-Low Attachment Microplate (Corning Inc., 7007)</p><p>·	Transwell (Corning Inc., 3470)</p><p>·	6-well Multiwell Cell Culture Plate (for example Corning Inc., 353046)</p><p>·	24-well Multiwell Cell Culture Plate (for example Corning Inc., 353047)</p><p>·	24-Well Multiwell Cell Culture Plates (VWR international, 10062-896)</p><p>·	Serological pipettes</p><p>·	Inverted microscope (for example Olympus, model CKX53)</p><p>·	Cell counter</p><p>·	Cell counter slides</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>MEDIUM SETUP</strong></p><p><strong>Gut Growth Medium</strong></p><p>Advanced DMEM/F12</p><p>B27 supplement; 1X</p><p>N2 supplement; 1X</p><p>HEPES; 15 mM</p><p>L-glutamine; 2 mM</p><p>Penicillin/streptomycin; 1X&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Medium for Primitive streak induction (Day 0 - 1)</strong></p><p>RPMI 1640</p><p>BMP4; 50 ng/mL</p><p>Activin A; 100 ng/mL&nbsp;</p><p>Penicillin/streptomycin; 1X</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Medium for Definitive endoderm induction #1 (Day 1 - 2)</strong></p><p>RPMI 1640</p><p>dFBS; 0.2%</p><p>Activin A; 100 ng/mL&nbsp;</p><p>Penicillin/streptomycin; 1X&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Medium for Definitive endoderm induction #2 (Day 2 - 3)</strong></p><p>RPMI 1640</p><p>dFBS; 2.0%</p><p>Activin A; 100 ng/mL&nbsp;</p><p>Penicillin/streptomycin; 1X&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Medium for Anterior gut cell induction (Day 3 - 7)</strong></p><p>Gut Growth Medium</p><p>FGF4; 500 ng/mL</p><p>CHIR99021; 2 µM</p><p>Noggin; 200 ng/mL</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Medium for Posterior gut cell induction (Day 3 - 7)</strong></p><p>Gut Growth Medium</p><p>FGF4; 500 ng/mL</p><p>CHIR99021; 3µM</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></p><p><strong>Maintenance of PSCs</strong></p><p>Maintain the undifferentiated hPSCs on feeder-free conditions in StemFit (Ajinomoto Co., Inc.)  or mTeSR1 medium (STEMCELL technologies) on plates coated with&nbsp;iMatrix-511 (Matrixome, Inc.) or Matrigel (Growth Factor Reduced; Corning Inc.) in an incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C.
