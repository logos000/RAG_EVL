Whereas it is a regularly used protocol for dephosphorylation in cell lysates, its use in immunohistochemistry has been limited. Here we describe a methodology to dephosphorylate adult murine tissues by using Antarctic Phosphatase, an alkaline phosphatase. This protocol is compatible with subsequent immunohistochemistry, making it suitable for validating phospho-immunoreactivity in tissues. </p><br>Keywords: tissue dephosphorylation, epitope dephosphorylation, alkaline phosphatase, antarctic phosphatase<br><h2>Reagents</h2><p>Xylol</p><p>Isopropanol</p><p>Ethanol </p><p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p><p>Dako Antigen Retrieval Agent pH9 (Cat.No. S2367)</p><p>Phosphate Buffered Saline<sup>++</sup> (PBS plus 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>)</p><p>Antarctic Phosphatase (AP) &nbsp;and AP buffer (50 mM Bis-Tris-Propane-HCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM, ZnCl<sub>2</sub> ,pH 6) (NEB, M0289S) </p><p>Bovine Serum Albumin (e.g. SIGMA A7906)</p><p><br></p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Boiling cuvette </p><p>Pressure cooker</p><p>Fat pen (e.g. Dako pen)</p><p>Humidified chamber</p><p>Incubator 37°C</p><p><br></p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><u>Deparaffinization</u></p><p>Deparaffinize the tissue sections from adult murine skin by submerging the sections in the following alcohol row: xylol for 5 minutes, fresh xylol in a different container for 5 minutes, isopropanol for 5 minutes, 96% ethanol for 5 minutes, 75% ethanol for 5minutes, 50% ethanol for 5 minutes, and H<sub>2</sub>O for 5 minutes.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Antigen retrieval</u></p><p>Retrieve the epitopes by boiling the sections in Dako Antigen Retrieval Agent pH9 (Dako) for 20 minutes inside a boiling cuvette in a pressure cooker.</p><p>Allow slides to cool down within the retrieval solution for 1h at room temperature and then wash twice with PBS<sup>++</sup>. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><u>Epitope dephosphorylation</u></p><p>Delimit the tissue sections with a fat pen (Dako pen).</p><p>Incubate tissue sections with 25U Antarctic Phosphatase in AP buffer, or with AP buffer only (vehicle control) for 2 hours at 37°C in a humidified chamber.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Blocking</u></p><p>Block unspecific binding sites with 5% BSA in PBS<sup>++</sup> for 1h at room temperature in a humidified chamber.
