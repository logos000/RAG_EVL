These mechanisms are believed to be tightly coupled to produce the finely tuned levels of protein synthesis required for cellular asymmetric structures and functions. To date, extensive effort has been invested in designing real-time visualization techniques to understand the dynamics of mRNA localization and translation at the single-molecule level. Although the many emerged techniques have revealed strong correlations between the spatiotemporal regulation of translation and specific cellular functions, their causalities have largely remained out of reach, due to a dearth of techniques for directly controlling specific mRNAs. Translation inhibitors and nucleotide-based strategies are used widely to manipulate mRNA localization and translation, but these techniques suffer from low spatial resolution and poor reversibility. Chemical compounds do not provide any specificity, and oligonucleotides typically require long lag times for their effects to manifest. Optogenetic approaches would be an ideal means to address these drawbacks. A variety of optogenetic methods exploiting photoreceptors from plants and bacteria have been developed to modulate a wide range of transcription and post-translational signaling, but little efforts have been made to control translation.&nbsp;Here, we present an optogenetic approach for robust and reversible inhibition of specific mRNAs in live cells.&nbsp;</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>- DMEM (Gibco)</p><p>- Fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen)</p><p>- 0.25% Trypsin (Gibco)</p><p>- DPBS (Gibco)</p><p>- Lipofectamine<sup>®</sup>LTX (Invitrogen)&nbsp;</p><p>- Lipofectamine<sup>®</sup>RNAiMax (Invitrogen)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>- T75 cell culture flask (Corning 430641U)</p><p>- 15 ml tube (VWR 82050-276)</p><p>- 96-well plates (μ-Plate 96 Well ibiTreat; ibidi GmbH)&nbsp;</p><p>- Microporator (Neon™ Transfection System, Invitrogen) </p><p>- Nikon A1R confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments)&nbsp;</p><p>- Chamlide TC system (Live Cell Instruments)</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p>Cell culture</p><p><br></p><p>- HeLa (ATCC) was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 10% CO2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Prewarm culture media (DMEM + 10% FBS) and Trypsin in a 37°C water bath.</p><p><br></p><p>- Aspirate culture media, gently rinse cells with DPBS, aspirate 1xPBS, then add 3 ml Trypsin to the culture flask (75T flask), and incubate under 37°C for 5 minutes to detach cells from the flask.</p><p><br></p><p>- Gently tap the flask to make sure all the cells are fully detached. </p><p><br></p><p>- Add 4 ml of culture media to the culture flask, and collect all the cells. </p><p> </p><p>- Transfer resuspended cells from the culture flask to a 15 ml tube, then centrifuge resuspended cells in the 15 ml tube at 2000rpm for 1 minutes.</p><p><br></p><p>- Aspirate supernatant, and resuspended cell pellet with fresh culture media, pipette up and down gently, to make sure cells are fully resuspended.</p><p><br></p><p>- Count the number of cells using a hemocytometer.</p><p><br></p><p>Transfection</p><p><br></p><p>- Use the microporator to transfect all mRNA-LARIAT components to the cells (except for PAMmer).
