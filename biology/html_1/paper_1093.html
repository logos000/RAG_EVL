These induced human hepatic progenitor cells (hiHepPCs) proliferate in long-term culture and give rise to hepatocytes and cholangiocytes as descendants. To induce hiHepPCs from endothelial cells, we first established an efficient culture condition, enabling hiHepPC generation and propagation in a monolayer culture. Then, we confirmed the ability of the hiHepPCs to differentiate into mature hepatocytes by formation of cell aggregates in each well of ultra-low attachment 96-well plates. Furthermore, upon culturing in Matrigel, the hiHepPCs differentiated into cholangiocytes and formed cystic epithelial spheroids, similar to human liver-derived cholangiocytes. Direct induction of the expandable and bipotential human hepatic progenitor cells provides a possibility for generating cells such as hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, which will be useful for developing therapeutic strategies for human liver diseases.</p><br>Keywords: liver, direct reprogramming, progenitor cell, endothelial cell, hepatocyte, cholangiocyte, transcription factor<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Presently, direct reprogramming technology can be used to convert somatic cells into other cell types, without going through the pluripotent state. Using the direct cell-lineage reprogramming method, mouse and human hepatocyte-like cells (iHepCs) reportedly could be generated from fibroblasts<sup>1-4</sup>. iHepCs will be useful alternatives to hepatocytes in the treatment of liver diseases. However, human iHepCs (hiHepCs) cannot proliferate unless immortalized using the SV40 large T antigen, MYC, and p53-siRNA<sup>3,4</sup>. Such nonphysiological activation of hiHepC proliferation may increase the risk of transformation into cancerous cells. Thus, in clinical hiHepC applications, secure proliferation induction is required. Meanwhile, recent progress in direct reprogramming technology enabled the induction of human somatic stem/progenitor cells, including neural stem<sup>5,6</sup>, intestinal progenitor<sup>7</sup>, and blood progenitor<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;cells, while the possibility of human hepatic progenitor cell generation was elusive. In our recent study, we identified a specific combination of transcription factors such as FOXA3, HNF1A, and HNF6 that directly induce the conversion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and peripheral blood-derived endothelial cells (HPBECs) into cells with the properties of hepatic progenitor cells. These hiHepPCs can continuously produce their cell population in long-term monolayer cultures and differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes after cell aggregate and cystic epithelial spheroid formation, respectively, under three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Cell</strong></p><p>Plat-GP (Cell Biolabs) Cat#RV-103</p><p>HUVEC (Takara) Cat#C-12200</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reagent</strong></p><p>Insulin (Wako) Cat#097-06474</p><p>Dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) Cat#D8893</p><p>Nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich) Cat#N0636</p><p>L-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque) Cat#16948-04</p><p>b-mercaptoethanol (Nacalai Tesque) Cat#21438-82</p><p>Recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) (PeproTech) Cat#100-39</p><p>A8301 (Tocris) Cat#2939</p><p>SB431542 (Tocris) Cat#S7067</p><p>Y-27632 (Wako) Cat#251-00514</p><p>Forskolin (Nacalai Tesque) Cat#16384-42</p><p>Penicillin/streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque) Cat#26253-84</p><p>GlutaMax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Cat#35050-061</p><p>HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich) Cat#83264</p><p>N-2 supplement (1×) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Cat#17502-048</p><p>B-27 supplement (1×) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Cat#12587-010</p><p>N-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich) Cat#A9165</p><p>Human recombinant EGF (Sigma-Aldrich) Cat#E9644</p><p>Human recombinant Noggin (PeproTech) Cat#250-38</p><p>Human recombinant R-spondin1 (Miltenyi Biotec) Cat#130-114-824</p><p>Human recombinant Wnt3a (R＆D Systems) Cat#5036-WN</p><p>Human FGF10 (PeproTech) Cat#100-26-500UG</p><p>Gastrin (Sigma-Aldrich) Cat#G9145</p><p>Protamine sulfate (Nacalai Tesque) Cat#29318-41</p><p>Medium 200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Cat#M200500</p><p>Low Serum Growth Supplement (LSGS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Cat#S00310</p><p>FibroLife S2 Comp kit (Kurabo) Cat#LL-0011</p><p>Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Nakalai Tesque) Cat#08458-16</p><p>DMEM and F-12 (Nacalai Tesque) Cat#08460-95</p><p>Advanced DMEM/F-12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) Cat#12634-010</p><p>Polyethylenimine (PEI) (Polysciences) Cat#23966-1</p><p>Poly-L-lysine (Nacalai Tesque) Cat#28358-64</p><p>Matrigel (BD Biosciences) Cat#354234</p><p>EGM-2MV BulletKit (Lonza) Cat#CC-3156</p><p>Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Nissui) Cat#05905</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Biosafety cabinet</p><p>Cell culture incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37°C</p><p>HOT PLATE (NISSIN) Cat#NHP-M20</p><p>12-well plate (FALCON) Cat#353043</p><p>24-well plate (FALCON) Cat#353047</p><p>15 ml tube (FALCON) Cat#352196</p><p>Type I collagen-coated&nbsp;6-well plate (IWAKI) Cat#4810-010</p><p>Type I collagen-coated&nbsp;24-well plate (IWAKI) Cat#4820-010</p><p>Type I collagen-coated&nbsp;48-well plate (IWAKI) Cat#4830-010</p><p>PrimeSurface 96-well plate (Sumitomo Bakelite) Cat#MS-9096M</p><p>0.2-µm cellulose acetate filter (Sartorius) Cat#17597K</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>A) Retrovirus production</strong></p><p>1.
