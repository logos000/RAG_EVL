Up to date, AMD is estimated to affect 170&nbsp;million worldwide, a number predicted to increase to 196 million in the coming five years and up to 288 million in 2040<sup>2</sup>, implying substantial social and financial consequences. AMD comes in two forms: neovascular or “wet” AMD, characterized by the abnormal growth of choroidal vessels through the Bruch’s membrane causing subretinal edema and hemorrhage, and “dry” AMD, which in advanced stages is characterized by well demarcated&nbsp;areas of RPE loss and outer retinal degeneration, also known as geographic atrophy (GA)<sup>3,4</sup>.&nbsp;The “dry” form accommodates 80-90% of the AMD patients and although neovascular AMD&nbsp;is currently treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections, there is no treatment available for “dry” AMD patients. Therefore, subretinal transplantation of RPE cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) emerges as a potential replacement therapy in GA. Although there are several protocols describing the derivation of RPE from a hPSC source, they still rely on the manual selection of pigmented patches of cells to reach higher purity<sup>5–10</sup>. Such manual selection makes large scale production of hPSC-RPE cells cumbersome and carries a potential risk of tumorigenicity if residual undifferentiated cells&nbsp;remain undetected in the final product. We have established an&nbsp;efficient xeno-free and defined monolayer differentiation methodology where culture on supportive human recombinant laminin eliminates the need for manual selection, allowing&nbsp;large-scale production of pure hPSC-RPE.</p><p><br></p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hPSC (hESC or hiPSC)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biolaminin 111 LN (BioLamina, cat. no.
