McCullough<br>Abstract: <p>Trans-epithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) can be used as a measure of cell monolayer confluence, health, and integrity.&nbsp;An Epithelial Voltohmmeter (EVOM) is used to take TEER measurements.&nbsp;This method details how to take TEER readings using an EVOM with chopstick electrode.</p><p><br></p><p>Please note that chopstick electrodes are only designed for use with 12 mm inserts.</p><p><br></p><p>Disclaimer: The contents of this article have been reviewed by the US Environmental Protection Agency and approved for publication and do not necessarily represent Agency policy.&nbsp;Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute endorsement or recommendations for use.</p><br>Keywords: TEER, trans-epithelial electrical resistance, epithelium, barrier function<br><h2>Equipment</h2><p>EVOM2 Epithelial Voltohmeter (World Precision Instruments Inc, Sarasota, FL, USA)</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><u>Preparing Cells for TEER Readings</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sterilize and soak probe in cell culture medium of the same formulation being used in the cell cultures to be tested prior to reading.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add cell culture medium to the apical side of each Transwell<sup>Ò</sup> </p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 mL for 24 mm insert </p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500μL for 12 mm insert</p><p><u>Taking TEER Readings</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect the electrode to the meter. Insert the RJ plug at the end of the flexible electrode cable into the Input port on the meter.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the Function switch to Ohms. Disconnect the EVOM2 from the charger and turn the Power on (I).</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To measure the blank resistance, place the electrode in a blank insert with cell media in the basal compartment and PBS in the apical compartment.</p><p>*When making measurements, the longer prong goes outside the insert in the media.&nbsp;The shorter prong goes over the Transwell<sup>Ò</sup>.&nbsp;The probe should not be angled and should be slightly touching the bottom of the dish. </p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert the electrode into the blank cup. A steady reading of the solution resistance should result. The value of the blank always adds to the total resistance measured across a tissue culture membrane. &nbsp;NOTE: The blank resistance must be measured and then subtracted from the resistance reading across tissue in order to obtain the true tissue resistance.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take three resistance readings per insert.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make experimental resistance measurements. Subtract the blank resistance to obtain the resistance value of cultured cell monolayers.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, clean and store the electrode dry. </p><p><u>Electrode Cleaning</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rinse with the electrode with distilled water and dry it.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a 1% solution of Tergazyme according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspend the tips of the electrodes in the Tergazyme solution, with the exposed electrode surfaces fully immersed. During soaking, the surfaces of the electrodes may be brushed with a soft brush (like a tooth brush), if desired. </p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soak overnight if the electrodes have not been cleaned on a regular maintenance schedule.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soak 30–60 minutes if on a weekly cleaning schedule or 5 minutes if on a daily schedule.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rinse well with distilled or de-ionized water. Allow electrode to air dry and store dry away from exposure to sunlight.</p><p><u>Probe Maintenance</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probe may be occasionally resurfaced by lightly sanding with 600-grit ultra-fine sandpaper.</p><h2>References</h2><p><strong>EVOM2 Instruction Manual:</strong></p><p>https://www.wpiinc.com/clientuploads/pdf/EVOM2_IM.pdf</p></body></html>
