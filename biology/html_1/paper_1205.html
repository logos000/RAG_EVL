Based on quantitative&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>HNMR (q<sup>1</sup>HNMR), the results are obtained rapidly and accurately. The method is available for viscous solutions to which other simpler techniques do not apply.</p><br>Keywords: quantitative 1H RMN, hand rub solutions, analytical chemistry<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>As the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerates around the world, many low- and middle-income countries are still struggling to access the diagnostic tests they desperately need to control the disease. Moreover, passive protection methods such as masks and hydro-alcoholic gels are the first means of defence to avoid chaotic spread of the virus among the population. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides a protocol that was taken into consideration in many national legislations.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In France, at the beginning of the pandemic, we applied this protocol to fabricate several dozens of litres of hydro-alcoholic mixture at our institute and the contents of ethanol or isopropanol in grams per grams of solution was determined by&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>H quantitative NMR (qNMR). If the contents of alcohols in liquids gels can be approximatively measured using a simple alcohol-meter, this technic is less appropriate for viscous liquids containing gelling agents. We report here a method of ethanol content measurement using&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>H quantitative NMR (<sup>1</sup>H qNMR). Our intention is to remind the scientific community of this well-known technic.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>D2O</p><p>3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid di sodium salt (TSPA, CAS: 2039-96-5, 97% purity).</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>NMR Brucker 400MHz.</p><p>3mm NMR tubes (Norell).</p><p>Balance (0.01 mg accuracy).</p><p>4 mL flat bottom screw neck vial equipped with a centred hole, screw closure closed by a silicone PTFE</p><p>syringe (Inject®-F 1 ml)&nbsp;</p><p>needle (Henke Sass Wolf, Germany, 0.6X25mm)&nbsp;</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>Sample preparation:</strong></p><p>- Masses are weighed using a Mettler Toledo balance (0.01 mg accuracy) into a 4 mL flat bottom screw neck vial equipped with a centred hole closed by a silicone PTFE (Macherey-Nagel, Germany).</p><p>- The standard is weighted first, then 2 mL of D<sub>2</sub>O are introduced.</p><p>- The vial is then closed and gently shaken until all the solid dissolves.</p><p>- The gel is added into the vial with a syringe (Inject®-F 1 ml) equipped with a needle (Henke Sass Wolf, Germany, 0.6X25mm) through the silicone join in order to minimize the evaporation of ethanol. - The solution was shaken, then 600 mL were transferred into 3 mm standard NMR tubes (Norell) for analysis.</p><p><strong>Pulse Program.</strong></p><p>Single pulse, without carbon decoupling (‘zg’ with 90° pulse). Data Points (acquired): 64 K. NS=64. Relaxation delay: D1=60s.&nbsp;Acquisition Time: 4s.

For this purpose, we used 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid di sodium salt (TSPA, CAS: 2039-96-5, 97% purity) as standard (also used as chemical shift reference) and D<sub>2</sub>O for NMR solvent.</p><p>After proper weighting of the standard and the gel, the masses of ethanol or isopropanol contained in the samples are calculated by equations 1:</p><p><br></p><p>Masse= [ 15 X 0.97 X M<sup>(Alc)&nbsp;</sup>X SInt<sup>Alc</sup>&nbsp;X m<sup>(Std)&nbsp;</sup>]/[ 218.3 X n<sup>1</sup>H<sup>(Alc)</sup>&nbsp;X SInt<sup>(Std)&nbsp;</sup>]</p><p>= [ 0.06665 X M<sup>(Alc)&nbsp;</sup>X SInt<sup>Alc&nbsp;</sup>X m<sup>(Std)&nbsp;</sup>]/[ n<sup>1</sup>H<sup>(Alc)</sup>&nbsp;X SInt<sup>(Std)&nbsp;</sup>] Eq.1</p><p><br></p><p>Where M<sup>(Alc)</sup>, n<sup>1</sup>H<sup>(Alc)</sup>&nbsp;and m<sup>(Std)&nbsp;</sup>are respectively the molecular mass, the number of integrated proton and the weighted masse of the chosen alcohol; SInt<sup>(Alc)</sup>&nbsp;and SInt<sup>(Std)</sup>&nbsp;being the sum of the integrals for the chosen alcohol and the standard; 15 and 218 and 0.97 being the total number of proton, the molecular mass and the purity of the standard.</p><p><br></p><p>For ethanol and isopropanol respectively, the equation resumes to:</p><p>Mass<sup>(ethanol)</sup>=[ 0.615 X SInt<sup>(Alc)</sup>&nbsp;x m<sup>(Std)&nbsp;</sup>]/ SInt<sup>(Std)&nbsp;</sup>Eq. 2</p><p>Mass<sup>(isopropanol)</sup>=[ 0.572 X SInt<sup>(Alc)</sup>&nbsp;x m<sup>(Std)&nbsp;</sup>]/ SInt<sup>(Std)&nbsp;</sup>Eq. 3</p><p><br></p><p>We found 75% and 68% for handrub solutions produced according to the WHO protocols.
