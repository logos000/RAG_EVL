The organoids recapitulate tumor-specific characteristics and display inter-tumor heterogeneity. Here we explain how to establish the organoid cultures, maintain them in defined, serum-free medium and use them for patient-specific drug testing. Within 10-14 days, a patient-derived organoid culture is established and can be serially passaged. Compared to other protocols focusing on organoid cultures derived from pediatric kidney malignancies or healthy kidneys, the protocol described here is optimized for adult ccRCC organoid cultures. Organoids established using this protocol can be used to further investigate tumor biology in a complex 3D in vitro system, complement current preclinical model-based drug studies, and advance the development of personalized therapy design.&nbsp;</p><br>Keywords: organoid, kidney cancer, ccRCC, kidney cancer organoid, kidney organoid, cancer model, disease model, preclinical model<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Kidney cancer is the twelfth most common malignancy in the western world and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is its most common form<sup>1</sup>. Even though significant advances have been made in the treatment of ccRCC, including receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies targeting VEGF-dependent angiogenesis, and more recently immune checkpoint inhibitions, the lack of suitable preclinical models has certainly impeded kidney cancer research both regarding the development of novel drugs as well as the stratification of suitable predictive biomarkers<sup>2,3</sup>. Therefore, improving the long-term prognosis of ccRCC will require novel models that pave the way to personalized medicine, which offers treatments that are specific to the biology of each tumor. Organoid cultures have increasingly been shown to recapitulate a tumor in vitro<sup>4</sup>. We have developed and characterized a novel ccRCC organoid culture system, which could be used to test the patient-specific response to treatment strategies in vitro<sup>5</sup>. In this protocol, we provide further detailed instructions on how to establish and maintain these culture systems and evaluate them for your individual research needs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Comparison with other methods</strong></p><p>Organoid culture conditions, described here, were adapted from those previously described, but were tailored to the specific needs of kidney cancer cells<sup>6,7</sup>. We optimized different conditions, enabling us to achieve long-term growth of primary ccRCC tissue with high efficiency. The composition of the medium is summarized in Table 1. We have shown that organoids exhibit kidney-specific epithelial differentiation, while retaining cancer stem cell populations. Organoids resemble proximal tubule structures – the potential cell of origin of ccRCC – and recapitulate typical characteristics of ccRCC, including glycogen deposits and lipid droplets<sup>5</sup>.</p><p>An earlier described kidney cancer organoid culture has established healthy kidney organoids and matched cancer organoid cultures. However, cancer organoid formation efficiency was much lower and organoids could only be maintained for few passages<sup>8</sup>. Other recently published organoid cultures have focused on pediatric cancers, including Wilm’s tumors, malignant rhabdoid tumors, renal cell carcinomas, and congenital mesoblastic nephromas<sup>9,10</sup>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Applications and limitations of the protocol</strong></p><p>Since organoids closely recapitulate several properties of the original tumor and since they are scalable for high-throughput drug screens, they present excellent<strong> </strong><em>in vitro</em> systems that connect clinical trials with cancer genetics, complement current preclinical model-based drug studies and advance the development of personalized therapy design. This has been successfully demonstrated in colorectal cancer organoids as well as in our study on kidney cancer organoids<sup>5,11</sup>.</p><p>Organoid technology can be combined with genome editing technologies to better understand specific disease mechanisms. The first CRISPR-generated genetic model of pluripotent stem cell-derived renal organoids modeled polycystic kidney disease<sup>12</sup>. Genome editing to model kidney cancer has not been done. However, in intestinal organoids, CRISPR-mediated gene modification of the most commonly mutated genes resulted in niche factor independence and carcinoma formation after xenotransplanation<sup>13</sup>. Moreover, 3D cell culture systems can be used in large CRISPR screens to determine growth-specific vulnerabilities that may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies<sup>14</sup>.</p><p>In our work, we focused on the determination of a cancer stem cell population and its implications for patient-specific therapy response in different patient-derived cancer systems<sup>5</sup>. Therefore our focus was to optimize growth conditions for tumor organoids. Growth of organoids derived from adjacent kidney tissue was less efficient in the developed tumor organoid medium. We conclude that the culture conditions would have to be adapted to the needs of healthy kidney tissue to derive a matched healthy kidney organoid.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Experimental Design</strong></p><p><strong>Overview of the procedure</strong></p><p>In our detailed protocol, we describe the establishment and cultivation of human renal carcinoma-derived organoids. The main procedure outlines the mechanical preparation and enzymatic digestion of the tumor tissues as well as the subsequent cell plating and organoid passaging (Steps 1-3). Cells are cultivated in Matrigel and cultured in defined medium, which is exchanged every 2-3 days. Cell rounding and organoid formation can be observed after 2-3 days.&nbsp;We also describe protocols for cryopreservation of kidney cancer organoids to build up personal biobanks (Step 4A) and for organoid preparation for immunocytochemistry, whole-mount confocal microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (Steps 4B-D) as well as for harvesting organoids for protein analyses and RNA extraction (Step 4E). Additionally, we describe the setup of a multi-well drug assay to systematically examine the effects of large- and small-molecule inhibitors on organoid viability (Step 4F).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Culture medium</strong></p><p>In this protocol, kidney cancer organoid cultures are grown in defined medium – its composition is summarized in Table 1. Unlike other organoid cultures, kidney cancer organoids exhibited no requirement for R-Spondin 1, since endogenous autocrine mechanisms to upregulate Wnt signaling were found<sup>5</sup>. Kidney cancer organoids showed strong dependence on EGFR and FGF. However, several other growth factors implicated in kidney development resulted in no benefit to organoid formation. We still expect that further optimizing the culture medium to obtain healthy kidney organoids is possible. For high efficiency of culture establishment and successful long-term maintenance, we suggest using appropriately stored mixtures of growth factors and chemical compounds, and using freshly prepared growth medium for 1 week of cultivation.<strong>﻿</strong></p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agarose (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15510-027)</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amphotericin B (Biomol, cat. no.

Organoids are 3D structures grown from stem cells, which differentiate into organ-specific cell types that self-organize through cell sorting and spatially restricted lineage commitment<sup>4</sup>. Renal cell carcinoma organoids described in previous publications showed inferior organoid formation efficiencies, could only be maintained for few passages, and were not fully characterized. Here we established organoids from kidney tumor biopsies that recapitulate their tissues of origin <em>ex vivo</em> and could be passaged and cultivated as a promising patient-specific pre-clinical <em>in vitro</em> model.</p><p>Following this protocol, rounding of cells and formation of small organoids can be detected within 2-3 d after seeding (Fig. 1a). Tumor-derived cells showed an organoid formation efficiency of 0,084%, which could be increased to 0,191% by previous sorting for cancer stem cells<sup>5</sup>. Generally, heterogeneity could be observed between cultures of different patients, however cystic structures were predominantly formed (Fig. 1a). Tumor organoids retained intra- as well as inter-tumor heterogeneity containing cystic as well as solid and tubular structures (Fig. 1b), thereby making them an excellent pre-clinical model for personalized medicine<sup>15</sup>.</p><p>To confirm the cellular identity of the organoids, immunofluorescence can be performed: tumor organoids should express the renal carcinoma marker carbonic anhydrase IX as well as the epithelial differentiation marker E-cadherin. As the tumor organoids established in this protocol recapitulate the proximal tubule as the putative cell-of-origin of ccRCC, organoids should also stain positively for lotus tetragonolobus, LTL (Fig. 2a,b).</p><p>The complexity of organoid cultures can further be analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Tumor organoids are polarized and show high numbers of cell interactions, including tight and adherens junctions as well as desmosomes that seal the inter-cellular space from the lumen.
