Pfaffl, Dietmar Zehn<br>Abstract: <p>tSCBR-seq is a T-cell tailored plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing protocol with superior mRNA capturing efficacy and dynamic range of gene detection. This was achieved through a series of chemical modifications of the original SCBR-seq protocol published by Soumilon and colleagues [1]. The performance of the protocol was also demonstrated in the article “Proliferation-competent Tcf1+ CD8 T cells in dysfunctional populations are CD4 T cell help independent” [2].</p><br>Keywords:

2-mercaptoethanol per well. Seal the plates well with adhesive foil and store them at room temperature for up to one day.</p><p><br></p><p>(!) Do not store the plates for prolonged periods to avoid lysis evaporation.</p><p><br></p><p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using large nozzle size (100μ) and single-cell purity mode, sort a single-cell of interest into each well of the PCR plate.</p><p><br></p><p>(!) Before sorting the population of interest, test the correct aiming of the machine. First sort 10-20 cells per well into few wells located on top and bottom of a sealed with transparent seal PCR plate. The droplets should be visible on the seal surface. Then sort 10-20 cells per well into few wells located on top and bottom of an empty PCR plate. The liquid droplet should be visible at the bottom of the PCR plate. Do not use smaller than 100μ nozzle to avoid unnecessary cell stress. The use of FACS for single-cell isolation allows for index sorting. Nevertheless, be conservative on the surface markers used for staining to avoid inducing gene expression changes.</p><p><br></p><p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after sorting, seal the plate with <u>adhesive foil</u>, spin it down for 30 seconds at 1000 rcf and snap-freeze it with dry ice.
