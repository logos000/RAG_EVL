However, the PGCs obtained from a single embryo was far from enough to meet the practical application, while somatic cells can be obtained in large quantities. Therefore, the problem of insufficient PGCs can be solved by the induction of somatic cells into PGCs. Here, we successfully transdifferentiate somatic cells into PGCs, which can be transplanted to the recipient to produce offspring. In detail, The CEF of Black-Feathered Langshan Chicken was reprogrammed into iPS by reprogramming factors <em>Oct4, Sox2, Nanog</em> and <em>Lin28</em>, then was induced into PGCs by BMP4/BMP8b/EGF system. The induced PGCs has similar biological characteristics to the primary PGCs, which was transplanted into White Plymouth Rock Chicken, which self-crossed to produce clone-like offspring. It was the the first time to demonstrate the feasibility of avian cloning from somatic cells.</p><br>Keywords: Chicken Primordial Germ Cells（cPGCs）；Trnasgenetic Chciken；Reprogramming<br><h2>Reagents</h2><p>DMEM (Hyclone, SH30243.01), Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, 25200072), FBS (Gibco, 10099141), Knockout-DMEM (Gibco, 10829018), β-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma, M3148), L-Glutamine (Sigma, 59202C), Non-Essential Amino Acid (Sigma, M7145), Knockout-DMEM (Gibco, 10829018), mLIF (Millipore,ESG1106), bFGF (Sigma, F0291), hSCF (Sigma, S7901), Chicken Serum (Gbico, 16110-082), Streptomycin (Solarbio, P1400-100), SEA-1 Antibody (Abcam, AB16285), 4% Paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, P1110), Triton X-100 (Solarpore, T8200), Tween-20 (Solarbio, T8200), T8220), Accutase Digestive Juices (Gibco,40506ES60), Polycoagulant (Santa Cruz, SC-134220), Mitomycin-C (MCE, Hy-13316), BMP4 (ProSpec,CYT-361), BMP8b (R&amp;D, 9316-BP), EGF (Thermo Scientific, PHG0314), DAPI (Beyotime, C1005), Anti-Fluorescent Quench Sealant (Solarbio, S2100), PAS staining KIT (Solarbio, G1281), CVH Antibody (ABCAM, AB13840), c-Kit Antibody (Themo Fisher Scientific, 14-1172-81), PKH26(Sigma, PKH26GL), Coloximide (TCI, C0380), Potassium Chloride (Shanghai Test, 67-56-1), Methanol (Shanghai test, 7447-40-7), Sodium Citrate (Shanghai Trial, 6132-04-3), Jimsa (Solarbio, G1015), Acetic Acid (Shanghai Trial, 1-101)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Fluorescent Microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan, DP72), Inverted Fluorescence Microscope (Olympus, Japan, DP70), FACS LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences, USA), Fluorescent Enzyme Scale Instrument (Tecan, Switzerland, Spark 10M), Bench Speed Automatic Balancing Centrifuge (Hunan Xiangji Laboratory Instrument Development Co., LTD., TDZ4-WS), Frozen Slicer (Leica, Dresden, German, CM1950)</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>1.
