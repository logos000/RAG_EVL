For both fields, genetic manipulation of T lymphocytes is a key technology. Many different methods have been described ranging from plasmid transfer by electroporation or chemical methods to the use of viral vectors<sup>1–3</sup>. Retroviral vectors (RVs) and lentiviral vectors (LVs) have emerged as basic technology for genetic manipulations in cell-based gene therapy medicinal products<sup>4</sup>. Those products consist either of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) harbouring an intact copy of the defective protein for the treatment of patients suffering from genetic diseases or lymphocytes expressing recombinant proteins like chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) for cancer immunotherapy<sup>5</sup>. In all the different methods used for genetic manipulation of T&nbsp;lymphocytes today, they are modified <em>ex vivo</em>, expanded and then infused into the patient. This is an established approach in immunology as well as in gene therapy. For the latter, this means that each patient is treated with an individual T cell product. Moreover, this approach exposes T cells to plenty of manipulations outside the organism that alter their phenotypes and properties<sup>6–8</sup>. This can be avoided through genetic manipulation directly <em>in vivo</em>, keeping the T lymphocytes in their environment. This strategy has become possible with so-called receptor-targeted LVs discriminating between T lymphocytes and other cells at the level of cell attachment and entry<sup>9</sup>.</p><p>The concept of receptor targeting is based on the idea that receptor usage of a gene-delivering vector determines its cell entry selectivity and thus restricts expression of the gene to a specific cell type. Receptor usage can be manipulated by adding targeting ligands to the vector surface that exhibit high affinity for a cell surface receptor selectively expressed on the desired target cell type. By simultaneously destroying natural receptor usage gene delivery to non-target cells is eliminated<sup>10</sup>. Viral glycoproteins compatible with this extensive protein engineering can be derived from paramyxoviruses, such as measles virus (MV) or Nipah virus (NiV). Here, receptor attachment and membrane fusion functions are split onto two glycoproteins. This is in contrast to the glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which is used in conventional LVs and has both functions combined. With engineered paramyxoviral glycoproteins, LVs have been generated that deliver genes selectively into distinct cell types, such as cancer cells, subtypes of neurons, or endothelial cells<sup>11,12</sup>. Making use of the distinct surface markers, CD8 for cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD4 for helper and regulatory T cells, enabled the generation of LVs targeted to these T cell subtypes<sup>13–15</sup>. The corresponding CD8-LV and CD4-LV have been instrumental for the <em>in vivo</em> delivery of CARs specific for the CD19 antigen present on B cell malignancies. A single intravenous (i.v.) injection of CD8-LV into humanized mice was sufficient to induce the formation of CD8+ CD19-specific CAR T cells, while CD4+ lymphocytes remained unmodified<sup>16</sup>. The <em>in vivo</em> generated CAR T cells eliminated CD19+ B lymphocytes as well as tumour cells<sup>17</sup>. Vice versa, CD4-LV mediated the exclusive generation of CD4+ CAR T cells, which interestingly were equally active in eliminating tumour cells<sup>18</sup>. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Applications </em></p><p>The <em>in vivo</em> generation of CAR T cells using CD8-LV or CD4-LV is currently the most prominent application of receptor-targeted LVs. We are therefore focusing on this topic providing protocols for the generation of CAR transferring <em>in vivo</em> applicable vector stocks and their administration in relevant mouse models. Since the animal model used is equally important as the vector generation, we also provide detailed protocols on mouse humanization, animal handling and monitoring for the presence of CAR T cells. The protocol is focusing on a myc-tagged second generation CD19-specific CAR. CAR T technology is constantly improving. The protocol can be applied to any other type of CAR, but may require adaptations in the part describing CAR T cell detection depending on the type of immunological tag or reporter gene that is used in combination with the CAR.&nbsp;A detailed protocol on CAR design and detection was recently published<sup>19</sup>. </p><p>Besides addressing cancer cells, targeting chronically infected cells is another important field of CAR T cell therapy<sup>20</sup>. The humanized mouse model described in the current protocol is well established for the testing of anti-HIV gene therapies, since it is engrafted with the spectrum of human cells susceptible to HIV, which leads to chronic viremia accompanied by HIV-induced loss of human CD4+ T cells. Moreover, it recapitulates HIV latency and generates human immune responses as in HIV patients <sup>21</sup>. The models mostly used to evaluate HIV therapies are NOD/shi-SCID, γc-/- (NOG)<sup>22,23</sup>, or NOD/SCID, γc-/- (NSG) <sup>24,25</sup> mice. Therefore, CD4-LV or CD8-LV delivering CARs directed against HIV can be evaluated in these humanized mice for CAR T cell generation followed by elimination of HIV-infected cells<sup>26,27</sup>. </p><p>Beyond CARs, the provided protocol can be used to package any gene of interest into CD4-LV or CD8-LV. Recombinant T cell receptor (rTCR) genes are an obvious related example, while anti-viral genes, cytokines or interfering RNA are other options, with the latter being relevant for more basic research questions. For <em>ex vivo</em>, gene delivery rates in the same range as those reported for CAR genes can be expected. <em>In vivo</em>, however, it must be kept in mind, that CARs (and also rTCRs) mediate a selective advantage for transduced T cells, potentially resulting in their preferential proliferation. Accordingly, we have observed between 5 to 25-fold higher rates of transduced cells after delivery of CAR genes than of reporter genes<sup>16</sup>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, other types of receptors can be targeted as long as their extracellular parts are readily accessible by the vector particle. Target receptors can be expressed on other human T cell subtypes, on completely different cell types, or even on cells of other species, as e.g. murine CD8 or CD4. In each case, the coding sequence for a suitable targeting ligand, preferably a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) or a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) is the starting point. Once confirmed that the fusion glycoprotein composed of targeting ligand and NiV G protein or MV H protein is well expressed on the surface of packaging cells, the protocol provided here for the generation of CD4-LV or CD8-LV stocks can be followed by exchanging the G or H encoding plasmids. When targeting receptors of other species, it has to be kept in mind that restriction factors may interfere with proper transduction<sup>28</sup>. Switching to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-derived vectors can solve this problem in case of NHP lymphocytes<sup>14</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Alternative methods for receptor-targeted gene delivery</em></p><p>The only other LV-based system for receptor-targeted vectors relies on engineered Sindbis virus (SIN) glycoproteins<sup>29</sup>. The corresponding SIN-LVs have been targeted to a variety of cell types including human T lymphocytes via CD4<sup>30</sup> or CD3<sup>31</sup>. However, data demonstrating the validity of these vectors on primary cells are scarce and the <em>in vivo</em> generation of CAR T cells has not been demonstrated with this technology. SIN-LVs have often been equipped with tissue-specific promotors to achieve sufficient selectivity. While a side-by-side comparison is missing, it seems that they do not reach the selectivity demonstrated for engineered paramyxoviral glycoproteins as e.g. illustrated by the discrimination between CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes<sup>32</sup>. Such an almost absolute selectivity in distinguishing between on-target and off-target cells can be of ultimate importance when toxic or oncogenic genes are delivered. Also for CARs, the inadvertent delivery of a CD19-CAR into the patient’s malignant cells can result in severe adverse events with fatal outcome as described for CAR delivery by VSV-LV<sup>33</sup>. Independently from selectivity, paramyxovirus glycoprotein based LVs are distinct from other LVs by their cell entry mode. SIN-LVs, similarly as VSV-LVs, require endocytosis of the target receptor for proper entry and transduction. MV and NiV pseudotyped LVs enter cells directly at the cell membrane under neutral pH<sup>34</sup>. Blockage of endocytosis enhances their gene delivery activity, especially when receptors with a high endocytosis rate have been targeted<sup>35</sup>. Conversely, this means that also target receptors with absent or low endocytosis rates can be used.&nbsp;</p><p>The development of non-viral vector systems has made enormous progress during the past years. Yet, it came with some surprise when the <em>in vivo</em> generation of murine CAR T cells was achieved with synthetic nanoparticles<sup>36</sup>. Stable integration of the CAR gene was mediated by a copackaged transposase and T cell selectivity via an incorporated CD3-specific antibody. While this achievement is promising for the gene delivery field, it is also obvious that such nanoparticles will require further improvement to reach the activity and selectivity of LVs. It remains to be seen if CD3-targeted nanoparticles can be engineered delivering CARs not only to murine but also to human T cells.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Alternative mouse models for in vivo CAR T cell generation </em></p><p>The humanized mouse with reconstituted human haematopoietic and immune cells is a powerful tool for investigation of human biological systems and for translational research<sup>37,38</sup>. Humanized mice enable direct access into the dynamics of the human immune-haematopoietic system. Two strains of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice homozygous for targeted mutations at the&nbsp;<em>Il2rg</em>&nbsp;locus are available: the NOD/SCID/IL2rγc<sup>null</sup>&nbsp;(NOG) strain<sup>22,23</sup> and the NOD/SCID/IL2rγ<sup>null</sup>&nbsp;(NSG) strain<sup>24,25</sup>. Compared to NOD/SCID mice, transplantation of human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs/hCD34<sup>+</sup> cells) into NSG or NOG recipient mice robustly improved the haemato-lymphoid engraftment efficiency and at least partially supported&nbsp;the maturation of human T and B cells, as evidenced by the development of Ig-producing human B cells as well as human CD4<sup>+ </sup>and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in secondary lymphoid organs <sup>23,24,39</sup>. These NSG or NOG mice have become the gold standard for evaluation of human haematopoiesis and immunity in the context of gene and cancer therapy including CAR T cell therapy <sup>40,41</sup>. </p><p>We chose here to describe humanization of the NSG model, since it is the most widely distributed model used in Europe and beyond. Therefore, the humanization protocol described here will be widely applicable beyond the <em>in vivo</em> evaluation of targeted vectors. Of note, because of its utility for evaluation of novel medicinal products, humanized mice are also commercially available. However, to dispose of a homogenous cohort of humanized mice it is highly recommended to generate them in house. Nevertheless, we need to emphasize that haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) humanized NSG mice are unable to develop a functional human innate immune system and thus do not support human myeloid, natural killer (NK) cell, erythroid and macrophage lineage development<sup>42,43</sup>. </p><p>Two different strategies offer an alternative: First, c-Kit receptor-mutant mice (c-Kit mutant mice) on the NSG background, which support unprecedented levels of human engraftment including myelo-erythroid differentiation<sup>44–47</sup>. Second, MI(S)TRG mice<sup>48</sup>, which are immunodeficient rag2<sup>-/-</sup>IL2rG<sup>-/-</sup> mice<sup>49</sup>, in which the human genes M-CSF, IL-3, GM-CSF and TPO were knocked into their respective mouse loci. In addition, these mice are transgenic for the human SIRPa, which allows mouse phagocytes to tolerate human engrafted cells. Still, none of these mouse models expresses human HLA molecules on thymic epithelial cells. Therefore, human T cells developing in hCD34<sup>+</sup> humanized NSG mice lack the ability to recognize antigens in a human HLA-restricted manner. However, when engrafted with HSPCs and a functional autologous human thymus, education of T cells on human HLA was achieved (BLT-mice)<sup>48,50,51</sup>. The BLT mouse model, although it has major advantages, is much more cumbersome to generate and human fetal liver and thymic tissue is not easily accessible to many research groups. </p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>Limitations </em></p><p>While selectivity for target cells is excellent for receptor-targeted LVs including CD4-LV and CD8-LV, the amount of gene transfer active particles in vector stocks often lags substantially behind that of VSV-LV. To compensate for that, it is of utmost importance that the complete production process is performed under the optimal conditions provided in this protocol for the production of CD8-LV or CD4-LV. Notably, the expected yield of particle numbers does not differ between targeted and non-targeted LVs. We therefore assume that the functional activity and stability of the engineered glycoproteins is reduced. Functional titers could indeed be improved by switching from MV glycoproteins to those of NiV, which are 3-4 times more efficiently incorporated into the lentiviral particle<sup>52</sup>. Likewise, DARPins instead of scFvs improved titers due to their higher stability<sup>53</sup>. </p><p>In this context, it is important to mention that functional titers provided in transducing units (t.u.) per volume very much depend on the particular experimental conditions and the cell type used. Yet, they are required to confirm the activity of a vector stock as a general quality check. They are in our experience rarely predictive for the <em>in vivo</em> performance of vector stocks, especially when comparing targeted and non-targeted vectors. Here, receptor-targeted LVs usually outperform VSV-LV, which attaches to multiple cell types <em>in vivo</em> via the LDL receptor resulting in a completely different biodistribution<sup>53</sup>. However, also <em>ex vivo</em>, CD4-LV and CD8-LV can reach or even outperform VSV-LV when applied in presence of transduction enhancers and/or on minimally activated T lymphocytes that express low levels of the VSV receptor<sup>32</sup>. </p><p>Often, a single surface marker is not sufficient to define a cell type of choice. Many subtypes of T lymphocytes exist, that can be distinguished through combinations of particular surface markers. Therefore, receptor-targeted LVs that depend on more than one cell surface marker are desirable. However, such vectors have not yet been described. The reason is that display of two different targeting ligands on the particle surface will rather expand than restrict the tropism of that vector, since each target receptor can be utilized separately. Notably, <em>in vivo</em> selectivity is influenced by many more parameters than just receptor expression. First, cells with a high target receptor density will be preferentially transduced over those with a lower density. Second, local administration routes directly into the tissue of choice, e.g. lymphoid tissues for CD4-LV and CD8-LV, can be an option to prevent encounters of the vector particles with the unwanted cell type. Third, promotor choice, miRNA target sequences as well as restriction factors expressed in particular cell types can prevent gene expression in some target receptor positive cell types. An example for CD4-positive cells not transduced by CD4-LV are monocytes, which are resistant to LVs in absence of vpx, the virion-associated protein encoded by most simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains and HIV-2<sup>54,55</sup>. These issues should be carefully considered when designing novel types of receptor-targeted LVs. </p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Experimental design </em></p><p>The process we describe here to achieve <em>in vivo</em> CAR T cell generation can be split into four parts (Fig. 1). The generation of CD8-LV or CD4-LV vector stocks is the crucial first step to achieve sufficient <em>in vivo</em> gene delivery rates (Fig. 1a; steps 1-14). The second part running in parallel to the vector production step is the generation of homogenously humanized mice (Fig. 1b, phase 1; steps 18-59). Part 3 then includes preconditioning and vector administration (Fig. 1b, phase 2; steps 60-63), while in the last step mice are monitored for 1-8 weeks (Fig. 1b, phase 3; steps 61-111). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Production and quality control of vector stocks </em></p><p>The generation of CD8-LV and CD4-LV stocks differs from conventional VSV-LVs, since they carry paramyxoviral glycoproteins. This adds another plasmid to the transfection step and requires more sensitive approaches for particle concentration. With respect to the latter, a small aliquot of packaging cell supernatant before concentration should be kept and assessed for vector particle activity to control the concentration step. Also, depending on the stability of the displayed scFv, syncytia formation in the packaging cells may occur, which makes the timing of particle harvest crucial<sup>56</sup>. Overall, it is recommended to follow the instructions for vector stock production as precisely as possible. The quality of the starting components, especially the plasmids and the packaging cells are of ultimate importance. As a positive control, VSV-LV stocks should be generated in parallel or in a test run and result in at least 5x10<sup>11</sup> particles/ml with 10<sup>8</sup>‑10<sup>9</sup> t.u./ml. Using an identical transfer vector plasmid for generation of the VSV-LV control stock is self-evident, since the encoded gene influences the delivery activity of the vector stock. </p><p>Functionality of the LVs has to be confirmed by incubation of target-receptor positive cell lines with different concentrations of the LV stock to determine the transducing units (t.u./ml) by staining of transgene positive cells via flow cytometer. For quantitative comparisons necessary for <em>in vivo</em> applications, however, the particle number of the LV stock appears more important. This can be measured either by nanoparticle tracking, which besides very precise particle numbers also provides the size of the particles, or via p24 ELISA. When producing new types of targeted LVs we recommend using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a transgene for initial testing of proper gene transfer activity. Also, selectivity can best be assessed with GFP by comparing gene transfer into target receptor positive and negative cells. The latter should be in the range of background activity. Moreover, expression and incorporation of the glycoproteins should be verified by Western blot analysis of vector stocks. CAR-encoding LVs should finally be tested for functionality on primary cells like peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to check for CAR-T cell development and killing of target cells (e.g. CD19+ cells in case of CD19-CAR T cells) <em>in vitro</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Generation of humanized mice</em></p><p>The immunodeficient NSG mouse lacking murine B, T, NK and functional myeloid cells is an excellent recipient for the engraftment of human CD34+ HSPCs, subsequently resulting in the development of a human blood system. To obtain a robust and homogeneous engraftment, we describe here the sub-lethal pre-conditioning of NSG mice with busulfan, which reduces the number of residual murine progenitors and makes space in the bone marrow for engraftment of human progenitor cells. Further, we describe the procedure for injection of the human CD34+ cells into the blood stream of the NSG mice for humanization. The quality of the CD34+ cells, age of the mice, as also sterile housing and experimental conditions are crucial to obtain an efficient engraftment as explained in this procedure.</p><p>Finally, this step of the protocol includes the quality control check for successful NSG humanization over time, which leads to the identification of the right time point for vector particle injection. To increase transduction levels <em>in vivo</em> we describe the pretreatment with IL7, which will slightly activate the T cells and make them more permissive to the vector that is subsequently injected.</p><p>Please note that humanized NSG mice are commercially available at The Jackson Laboratory. Alternatively to a full humanization with blood stem cells, NSG mice can also be engrafted with human PBMC before LV administration. This mouse model can also be combined with tumour cells as target for the <em>in vivo</em> generated CAR T cells (Fig. 2).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <em>Detection of in vivo generated CAR T cells</em></p><p>Monitoring of the mice after vector administration, detection of CAR T cells and target cell specific transduction in blood is performed at different time points, while tissues are analysed at experimental endpoint conditions. While protocols for CAR T cell detection and analysis in mouse models have been published, it is important to emphasize that the kinetics of CAR T cell development after <em>in vivo</em> gene transfer differ substantially from that of transplanted <em>ex vivo</em> generated CAR T cells. <em>Ex vivo</em> generated CAR T cells are expanded in culture and then transplanted into mouse models in high numbers resulting in an instant high concentration of CAR T cells <em>in vivo</em>. Timing and detection methods therefore have been adapted to the requirements of <em>in vivo</em> CAR T cell generation.&nbsp;</p><p>The detection of the <em>in vivo</em> generated CAR T cells can be challenging when the signal to noise ratio obtained by flow cytometry is low. It is then crucial to have sufficient numbers of control mice available. Such mice injected just with PBS or control particles are essential to set the gating for the identification of CAR expressing T lymphocytes.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>REAGENTS</p><p><strong><u>Lentiviral vector production and analysis:</u></strong></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plasmids (see Fig. 3 for details):</p><p>Note: All plasmids should be adjusted to a concentration of about 1 µg/µl to use similar volumes in each production.

For that, add 8&nbsp;ml medium to the culture plates, then dilute the cells to a concentration of 2x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and add 10 ml of this cell suspension to the plates.</p><p>Note: To have enough cells for the production expand your cells to ~18 T175 flasks four days before seeding. Check the condition of the cells before seeding. For the transfection, we prefer to work with 15&nbsp;cm culture plates instead of T175 flasks, though this is also possible. Plates have a higher risk for contaminations, but allow a quicker workflow as they are easier to handle, especially when many plates have to be processed.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL</strong> Handling of the plates: Be careful not to move your hand or material above an uncovered plate to avoid contaminations. Evenly spread the cells on the plates by carefully tilting the plate back and forth and from left to right after seeding.</p><p><strong>?

This can be achieved by first changing the medium of 20 plates, then starting to prepare the DNA Mix and PEI Mix (step 4), and performing the medium change of the remaining 20 plates during the incubation time of the transfection mix.</p><p><strong>? TROUBLESHOOTING</strong></p><p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately prepare the DNA Mix and PEI Mix required for transfection in conical-bottom, sterile polypropylene tubes. First, prepare DNA Mix in a 250&nbsp;ml tube and then prepare PEI Mix in another 250&nbsp;ml tube. The following amounts are for transfection of 40 cell culture plates:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>DNA mix:</u> Combine 92&nbsp;ml DMEM without any supplement with 606.9&nbsp;µg pS‑CD19.CAR‑W and 577.8&nbsp;µg pCMV‑dR8.91. As a next step, add 35.9 µg of pCAGGS-NiV-GcΔ34-αCD8opt and 179.5 µg pCAGGS-NiV-FcΔ22 for production of CD8-LV or 53.9 µg of pCG-Hmut-CD4.DARPin29.2 and 161.5 µg of pCG-FcΔ30 for production of CD4-LV.</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>PEI mix:</u> Combine 5.6&nbsp;ml PEI with 88&nbsp;ml DMEM without supplements</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: Amounts can be downscaled to e.g. five 15&nbsp;cm cell culture plates per vector.</p><p><strong>? TROUBLESHOOTING</strong></p><p>The total amount of plasmid DNA per plate is 35&nbsp;µg with a ratio of 1:3:11.3:10.7 between targeted glycoprotein plasmid, fusion protein plasmid, transgene plasmid and packaging plasmid for CD8-LV (as for other NiV glycoprotein based LVs) and a ratio of 1:5:16.9:16.1 for CD4-LV (as for other MV glycoprotein based LVs). The amount of PEI per µg of DNA is 3.68&nbsp;µg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note: The transgene plasmid can be freely chosen. When setting up LVs targeted to other receptors we recommend using GFP for validation. Plasmid ratios may have to be adapted when using transgenes of different size. For third generation packaging LVs plasmid amounts have to be adapted as follows: Instead of using 577.8 µg pCMV-dR8.91 use 385.0 µg of the plasmid coding for Gag/Pol (pMDLg/pRRE, addgene #12251) and 192.77 µg of the plasmid coding for Rev (pRSV-Rev, addgene #12253). The other plasmid amounts are not changed.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: VSV-LVs should be produced as a positive control, when testing new transgenes. Use 245 µg of the VSV-G envelope plasmid (pMD2.G, addgene #12259), 700 µg of the transgene plasmid and 455 µg of the packaging plasmid.</p><p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoroughly mix PEI-Mix and DNA-Mix individually by vortexing for 30 seconds, respectively. Then add PEI-Mix to DNA-Mix and vortex again for 30&nbsp;seconds. Incubate for 20-30&nbsp;min at room temperature.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL</strong> To not exceed this incubation time medium change of at least 20 plates should be completed before preparing the transfection mix.</p><p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the incubation period, pipette 4.6&nbsp;ml of the transfection mix from step 5 to each plate using a 10-ml pipette. Carefully tilt the plates to disperse the medium evenly.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL</strong> Avoid disturbing the attached cells by slightly tilting the plate and carefully pipetting the solution SLOWLY to its border. Distribution of the transfection mix drop by drop is not necessary. Transfect only 10 plates at a time and leave the rest of the plates in the incubator to keep the cells in optimal culture condition.</p><p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return the dishes to the tissue culture incubator with a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C and incubate them over night for 16-18&nbsp;h.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>Stack the dishes horizontally to make sure cells are completely covered with medium any time.</p><p>Note: Transfection can also be performed in the morning (if cell density is &gt; 75%). In this case, medium is replaced 6-8 h after transfection on the same day. Harvest of LV particles will still be two days after transfection, as described in this protocol.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Medium change Timing: Day 3 early morning (~16 h post transfection)</strong></p><p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently aspirate the medium from the cells and add 18&nbsp;ml DMEM (10% FBS, 2&nbsp;mM L‑glutamine). Incubate the plates in a tissue culture incubator with a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C for 24&nbsp;h.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>Only take 10 plates at a time out of the incubator to keep the cells in optimal culture condition. Change the medium of only two plates at once to avoid cell dehydration.</p><p>Note: If cells were transfected in the morning, medium is replaced 6-8 h after transfection on the same day. When using T175 flasks 20 ml DMEM is required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harvest of lentiviral vector particles Timing: Day 4 morning</strong></p><p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get rid of cell debris, filter the cell supernatant through a 0.45&nbsp;µm Bottle Top Filter placed on a 500&nbsp;ml storage bottle. One filter is sufficient for filtration of the supernatant of 20&nbsp;plates. Filter the LV-containing supernatant by connecting a pump to the filter and collect the flow through.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>Keep the supernatant on ice after filtration.</p><p><strong>PAUSE POINT</strong> Store at least one aliquot of the unconcentrated filtered cell culture supernatant at ‑80°C (4°C in case of titration on the next day) to later compare titers of unconcentrated and concentrated vector stocks. An additional vector harvest after another 24&nbsp;h can be considered to increase vector yields<strong>.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Concentration of vector stock over sucrose cushion Timing: Day 4 – 5</strong></p><p>10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribute the filtered supernatant to four 250&nbsp;ml conical centrifuge tubes. Aspirate 14&nbsp;ml of the 20% sucrose solution with a 10-ml pipette. Insert the pipette to the bottom of the centrifuge tube containing the filtered supernatant and slowly underlay with 9&nbsp;ml of the sucrose solution. Stop expelling the solution when it hits the 5&nbsp;ml mark on the pipette. Discard the rest of the solution and use a new pipette for the next tube.</p><p>Note: The extra volume in the pipet is necessary to avoid bubbles in the tube, since the 5 ml mark of a 10-ml pipet is still visible when being inserted in the centrifuge tube containing the supernatant.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>The sucrose cushion should be pipetted very gently to avoid mixing of the two phases.</p><p>11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balance the tubes by addition of PBS w/o Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> until the weight difference is below 0.1&nbsp;g.</p><p>Note: Weighing can be done outside the cell culture hood, although the tubes have to be kept closed. However, PBS has to be added under the cell culture hood to maintain sterility.</p><p>12)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centrifuge for 24&nbsp;h at 4°C (4500×g; acceleration: 6; deceleration: 6) in a benchtop centrifuge.</p><p>Δ <strong>CRITICAL </strong>The centrifugation time should be set for at least 24 h or more. Set the centrifuge on “Hold” to be sure it does not finish before you are ready to proceed.</p><p>Note: You can also concentrate the vectors by ultracentrifugation (SW32 Ti Rotor) for 2&nbsp;h at 100,000×g, but due to the volume restrictions, we prefer low speed centrifugation. If you decide for ultracentrifugation, we recommend using Open-Top Thinwall polypropylene tubes (Beckmann Coulter, 38.5&nbsp;ml, 25x89&nbsp;mm, cat. no. 326823) for centrifugation of the supernatant. These tubes have to be filled to the maximum to prevent collapsing.

In this case, supernatant should be aspirated with a 10&nbsp;ml pipette and filtered with a 0.45&nbsp;µm syringe filter. One filter can be sufficient for two plates by carefully detaching the pipet without clogging the filter (e.g. by keeping ~ 3 ml volume in the pipet).

For this purpose, human PBMC are purified from whole blood or buffy coats from healthy donors via a Ficoll gradient (e.g. Histopaque 1077, Sigma Aldrich, cat. no. 10771) as described in the manufacturer’s protocol.</p><p>For the activation of 2x10<sup>6</sup> PBMC, a 24-well is coated with 500 µl of 1&nbsp;µg/ml anti-human CD3 mAb (clone: OKT3, Miltenyi Biotec) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. Remove medium and replace with 2% BSA in PBS w/o Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> (sterile filtered) for 30 min at 37°C. After washing with PBS w/o Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>&nbsp;twice, 2x10<sup>6</sup> PBMC are seeded in 2 ml T Cell medium (TCM) supplemented with 3&nbsp;µg/ml anti-human CD28 mAb (clone: 15E8, Miltenyi Biotec) and 50&nbsp;U/ml IL‑2 and the plate is incubated for 72&nbsp;h at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 90% humidity. 0.4-1x10<sup>5</sup> activated PBMC are seeded per 96‑well in a volume of 100&nbsp;µl in TCM + 50 U/ml IL‑2. PBMC are then transduced with 5&nbsp;µl vector stock diluted in 100 µl medium per well. Spinfection is performed at 850×g (acceleration: 7, deceleration: 7) for 90&nbsp;minutes in a preheated centrifuge (32°C). Afterwards, 100&nbsp;µl TCM are added into each well and cells are incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 90% humidity. After a cultivation of 4‑7&nbsp;days, the number of transduced cells is determined via flow cytometry with the corresponding antibodies.</p><p>Note: PBMC activation can be adjusted according to the amount of cells needed. E.g. you can activate 1x10<sup>7</sup> PBMC in a 6-well using 1 ml anti-human CD3 mAb (1&nbsp;µg/ml) for coating, and seeding cells in a total volume of 6 ml per well.</p><p>Note: The amount of vector stock per well when transducing primary cells might have to be adjusted according to the gene transfer activity of the vectors determined on Molt 4.8 cells.

These CAR T cells carry the genetic information for the CD19-CAR stably integrated in their genome. This genetic modification is restricted to the target-receptor expressing cell type, which are human CD4+ T cells for CD4-LV and CD8+ T cells for CD8-LV. Any other human or mouse cells present in the animals do not become genetically modified. When closely following the provided protocol, up to 10% of T cells, most of them carrying a single vector copy,<em> </em>either in the fraction of human CD8+ (with CD8-LV) or CD4+ (with CD4-LV) cells, in blood, spleen and bone marrow of NSG mice transplanted with human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells can be expected to convert into CAR T cells. As a consequence, the CD19+ target cells of the CAR become completely eliminated in these mice. Key for achieving this result are properly humanized mice and vector stocks with sufficient activity. Based on the protocol described above, animals with at least 40% humanization, i.e. human CD45+ cells of total CD45+ cells, can be enrolled in the experiment, although with this procedure a humanization of more than 80% is expected. CD4-LV and CD8-LV stocks produced according to the protocol should contain at least 5x10<sup>11</sup> particles/ml and 10<sup>7</sup> t.u./ml as determined on target-receptor positive cell lines (Fig. 4), while target-receptor negative cells do not become genetically modified. With a total volume of about 2.5 ml per vector stock CAR T cells can be generated in 10-15 mice. Beyond the CD19-CAR, any other therapeutic or gene of interest can be packaged into CD4-LV or CD8-LV using the provided protocol. Yields of vector particles and gene transfer activities may then differ. This holds true also for LV targeted to other surface receptors than CD4 or CD8, for which the same protocol for vector stock generation can be followed. </p><h2>References</h2><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Radek, C.<em> et al. </em>Vectofusin-1 Improves Transduction of Primary Human Cells with Diverse Retroviral and Lentiviral Pseudotypes, Enabling Robust, Automated Closed-System Manufacturing. <em>Hum.
