Hence, the VFA determination in rumen fluid allows the evaluation of the nutritional quality of a diet, as well as its potential impact on the chemical composition of ruminant milk and meat. Thus, we developed a protocol to extract, identify, and quantify acetic, propionic, butyric, valeric, and caproic acids in ruminal fluid samples using RP-HPLC-DAD. Despite literature findings had shown that the most suitable column for VFA chromatographic separation under HPLC-DAD is an ion-exchange column, our protocol showed that a C18 column also allows an efficient VFA separation of the aforementioned acid, except for butyric and iso-butyric acids. This condition may constitute a limitation of the Hypersil GOLD C18 column use for VFA determination. However, considering that the concentration of iso-butyric acid is significantly lower than that of butyric acid, a good estimation of butyric acid can be obtained.</p><p><br></p><br>Keywords: fatty acid extraction, HPLC, rumen fluid, short-chain fatty acid<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Ruminants obtain nutrients from feeds for milk, meat, and wool production. But nutrient utilization from feeds implies the activity of different digestive processes, in which rumen microorganisms play a central role in. When ruminant consumes forage or concentrates, the carbohydrate and protein molecules enter the rumen and these are initially catabolized by the action of enzymes secreted by rumen bacteria, fungus, and protozoa. The final products of this catabolic process are the volatile fatty acids (VFA) or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The VFA are short carbon chain compounds that are produced during the fermentative degradation of feeds in the rumen. These are absorbed by the rumen wall and converted by anabolic processes into carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids being these largely deposited in milk and meat.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Generally, formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, iso-butyric, 2-methyl butyric, valeric, isovaleric, caproic, and caprylic acids are considered as VFA. However, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids are the main VFA produced during the feed rumen fermentation. Hence, the objective of this protocol is to describe a method to extract, identify, and quantify VFA in rumen fluid samples, using RP HPLC-DAD as a quantification technique.</p><p><br></p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>3.1 Extraction solution:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>Solution of ortho-phosphoric acid 0.85% (v/v) containing adipic acid in the concentration of 24 mM (100 mL) (working solution):</em>&nbsp;accurately and carefully weigh 0.3507 g of adipic acid (internal standard; Sigma Aldrich®) in a beaker and dissolve them in 50 mL of distilled water (this process needs to be done with magnetic stirring and slight heating).

However, the Hypersil GOLD C18 column allows an efficient VFA separation, except for butyric and iso-butyric acids. This condition may constitute a limitation of the Hypersil GOLD C18 column use for VFA determination. However, considering that the concentration of iso-butyric acid is significantly lower than that of butyric acid, a good estimation of butyric acid can be obtained.</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>1. According to Hypersil GOLD C18 column manufacturer, the secure pH range of buffer use is between 2 – 8. Therefore, in case of future optimizations of this chromatographic method, the use of solvents or mobile phases with a pH out of this range must be avoided to preserve the activity of the stationary phase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. The column used in the proposed method does not allow the use of 100% aqueous mobile phases (example: the use of solutions of inorganic acids). Therefore, in case of future optimizations of this method, the use of a mobile phase 100% aqueous must be avoided.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Depending on the rumen fluid sample volume used, the quantities of reagents to be used during the VFA extraction can be proportionally reduced without significant effects on the chromatographic separation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Verify that the concentration of the internal standard in the final rumen samples and the calibration curve point tends to be the same, assuming that internal standard remains constant after VFA extraction. In this protocol, we calculated the quantities of reagents to preserve a similar concentration of the internal standard in both samples and calibration points (6 mM).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. Calculations (for each VFA using the internal standard method):</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A: for calibration points:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Determination 1: compute VFA peak area / internal standard peak area (for each calibration point).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Determination 2: compute VFA peak concentration (i.e., 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mM) / internal standard peak concentration (6 mM; for each calibration point).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Plot Determination 1 (y) vs Determination 2 (x) and fit a linear regression equation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>B: for samples:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Determination 3: compute VFA peak area / internal standard peak area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.&nbsp;Using determination 3, calculate VFA peak concentration / internal standard peak concentration of samples from the linear regression equation fitted in step 3. After that, multiply this value by the internal standard concentration initially defined (i.e., 6 mM in our protocol).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6. The result derived from step 5 must be multiplied for the appropriate dilution factor (i.e., FD = (4/2)*(1000/500) = 4 in our protocol). This should be the VFA concentration in mmol/mL rumen fluid.</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>For 5 samples:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Mobile phase Reagent preparations: 10 min</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Sample preparation: 15 min.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Calibration curve preparation: 100 min (one calibration curve for all analyzed samples).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- HPLC-DAD set-up and stabilization: 15 min.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- HPLC-DAD run time: 18 min</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Data analysis: 5 min.</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>The representative chromatograms of standards and a rumen fluid sample are shown in figures 1 and 2, respectively (see figures section)</p><h2>References</h2><p>Chromeleon® 7.
