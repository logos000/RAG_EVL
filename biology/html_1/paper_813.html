The procedure takes 2 days from recovery of gametes/embryos from the mouse to imaging of samples in a confocal microscope. The procedure uses bent capillaries and a mouth pipette with a filter, allowing for movement of the samples between solutions following necessary incubation times. This simple procedure works quite efficiently and is an easy skill to master with the availability of the necessary tools. </p><br>Keywords: Epigenetics, developmental biology, transposons, histone modification<br><h2>Reagents</h2><p><em>Material:</em></p><p>- M2 medium supplemented with 4 mg/ml BSA;</p><p>- M2/BSA medium supplemented with hyaluronidase from 6 mg/ml stock diluted 1:20 (300ug/ml final concentration);</p><p>- PBS supplemented with 1% (w/v) BSA;</p><p>- PBS supplemented with 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100;</p><p>- PBS supplemented with 4% (w/v) PFA (resolubilized by heating at 37C and cooled down before using).</p><p>- Oocytes/preimplantation embryos from mouse</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>-Standard Leica bright field dissection microscope </p><p>- 96 well round U-bottom plate (Nunclon)</p><p>- 45 degree bent glass capillaries</p><p>- Mouth pipette for handling and denudation of oocytes/embryos</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong><em><u>Collection and storage of oocytes/pre-implantation embryos:</u></em></strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean the oocytes/embryos from surrounding cumulus cells/sperm by incubating them in a 50 uL drop of hylarunidase diluted 1:3 with M2 media. </p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the drop at 37C for 3-4min on a heated stage.</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect and wash oocytes/embryos in M2 media.</p><p>- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove zona pellucida (this also clears out any remaining cumulus cells) by washing in a 50 uL drop of Acid Tyrodeâ€™s solution while moving the zygotes continuously.
