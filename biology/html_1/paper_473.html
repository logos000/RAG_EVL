The <em>E. coli</em> <em>gusA</em> gene is often used in plant research because plants lack an endogenous <em>gusA</em> gene. In <em>E. coli</em>, the transcript of the <em>gusA</em> gene is more stable than that of the highly used reporter gene beta-galactosidase (<em>lacZ</em>) [2]. The GusA activity can be determined using the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranosid (pNPG). pNPG is converted to glucoronic acid and para-nitrophenol (pNP), which can be quantified spectrometrically at 405 nm. To avoid background, it is best to use an <em>E. coli</em> strain with a deletion of the chromosomal <em>gusA</em> gene, which is available e.g. at the Keio collection [3]. The <em>gusA</em> gene can be used for transcriptional fusions, e.g. to characterize promoters, and also for translational fusions, e.g. to study translational regulation. The assay was adapted to the microtiter plate format to enable the parallel handling of a large number of samples. The “procedure” (see below) describes an application with the <em>gusA</em> gene in a translational fusion with the gene of interest cloned under the control of the inducible arabinose promoter P<sub>BAD</sub>.</p><p><br></p><br>Keywords: Escherichia coli, reporter gene, gusA, enzyme assay<br><h2>Reagents</h2><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20% (w/v) arabinose</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1M Tris-HCl pH 7.2</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sodiumphopsphate buffer: 50mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 50mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GusA lysis buffer: 10mM sodiumphosphate buffer, 10mM KCl, 1mM MgSo<sub>4</sub></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2x β-glucuronidase buffer: 10mM sodiumphosphate buffer, 20mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (v/v) triton-X-100</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pNPG: 8mg/mL in 0.1M Tris-HCl pH7.2 (prepared freshly)</p><p><br></p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microtiter plate (MTP) photometer</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;96 well microtiter plates</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierce<sup>TM</sup> BCA Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific)</p><p><br></p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><u>Cell culture and harvesting</u></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inoculate 50 mL medium in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with plasmid-containing overnight cultures to an inital OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05. At least three biological replicates of each sample should be used and a negative control (culture with an empty vector) should be added. When the cultures reach an OD<sub>600</sub> of about 0.6, induce the p<sub>BAD</sub> promotor with a final concentration of 0.2% (w/v) arabinose. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incubate the cultures for at least 30 minutes to allow expression of the <em>gusA</em> fusion gene. Harvest 20mL for the reporter enzyme assay by centrifugation at 4000rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. </p><p>If a transcript analysis is also desired, further 8mL culture can be harvested in parallel (4000rpm, 10 minutes, 4°C). The pellets can be stored at -80°C for later RNA Isolation (compare the Method “Northern blot analysis”).</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuspend the pellets for the reporter enzyme assay in 1mL GusA lysis buffer.

The assay has been adapted to 96 well MTPs to enable the parallel processing of many samples. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used to generate a standard curve, using concentrations form 0 mg/ml to 2 mg/ml. The colorimetric biuret-reaction results in the formation of a blue color, which can be quantified photometrically at 562 nm. The BSA standard curve is used to calculate the protein concentrations of all samples (mg/ml). </p><p>13.&nbsp;The specific GusA activity [U/mg] is calculated by dividing the volume activity [U/ml] with the protein concentration [mg/ml]. </p><p><br></p><h2>References</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[1] R.A.
