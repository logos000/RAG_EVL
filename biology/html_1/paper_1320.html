In obese patients, there is a different cell homing pattern in AT. We have developed a protocol for NK cell isolation and expansion from AT as follows: 1) harvesting stromal vascular fraction, 2) negative selection of NK cells with MACS, 3) Expansion in a closed system bag on the constant shake, 4) Chemokine activation and 5) cytotoxicity evaluation test of the final product. The entire process with a population of ten billion CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells last only less than 16 days. We have noticed that a large population of NK cells entrapped in AT, while there is a decrease in NK cells count in their peripheral blood (PB) despite no changes in the total number of mononuclear cells. NK cell population harvested from AT has a different pattern in the expression of some cytotoxicity receptors. So, the AT is an important source for NK cell immunobiology studies.</p><br>Keywords: Adipose tissue, Immunobiology, Natural killer cell<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Natural Killer cells (NKs) that comprise between 4-20% of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) <sup>(1)</sup> with a half-life of 7-10 days in the circulation <sup>(2)</sup> are the first line of defense against neoplasms without a need to prior sensitization <sup>(3)</sup>. Mature NKs also are found in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, lung, and omentum and in the uterus during gestation. They are regulated by stimulatory and inhibitory signals and express at least one specific inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) for a self-MHC class I allele to kill cells that lack self-MHC class I molecules <sup>(4)</sup>. In obese patients, there is a different cell homing pattern in adipose tissue (AT) <sup>(5)</sup>. In our laboratory, we found that some patients have increased levels of NKs in their abdominal AT while there is a decrease in NKs count in their peripheral blood (PB) despite no changes in a total number of PB mononuclear cells <sup>(6)</sup>. AT is a primary site of inflammation in obesity, and its macrophages especially M1 have the main role in these processes <sup>(7)</sup>. The AT secrete some hormones, play a role in glucose homeostasis <sup>(8)</sup>, and in addition to adipocytes, pre-adipocytes, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts and etc., <sup>(9)</sup> it harbors immune cell types including macrophages, neutrophils <sup>(10)</sup>, mast cells <sup>(11)</sup>, dendritic cells <sup>(12)</sup>, B cells <sup>(13)</sup>, T cells <sup>(14)</sup>, NK and NKT cells <sup>(15)</sup> (Fig 1). In obese patients a large population of NKs resides in AT which its count exceeds the blood stream NKs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Several protocols have been described in the NKs selection, expansion and activation with many cytokines or co-culture methods. We have tried many of these protocols and modified a new one <sup>(6)</sup>. This protocol is optimized for the human adipose tissue by providing extensive details of the technique to overcome limitations in NK cell purification and activation.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution without Ca<sup>2</sup> <sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2 +</sup> <em>(HBSS; Gibco, cat. no. 14170-112)</em>.</p><p>Phosphate-buffered saline <em>(PBS; Gibco, cat. no. 10010-002)</em>.</p><p>Collagenase type 1 <em>(Sigma, cat. no. 9891)</em>.</p><p>Penicillin/streptomycin <em>(Pen-Strep; Sigma, cat. no.

This population that reaches to more than 10<sup>10</sup> cells could be used for <em>in vitro</em> or <em>in vivo</em> preclinical assays like cytotoxicity evaluation process.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Cytotoxicity evaluation of activated NK cells </em></strong></p><p>Cytotoxicity of NK cells was determined by incubating them with target prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (we have used <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> PTCC 1240 and <em>Escherichia coli</em> PTCC1398 bacteria and neuroblastoma SKN-SH and CHLA-255 cell lines) at different ratios as follows:</p><p>40.

Cover the plate with foil to protect it from light and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature.</p><p>47. Add 50 μl of Stop Solution to each well.</p><p>48. Harvest the supernatant after 15 minutes, homogenate the solution and degas any large bubbles.</p><p>49. Record the absorbance at 490 nm 1 hour after adding the Stop Solution.</p><p>50. Subtract the average values of the culture medium background from all values of experimental wells.</p><p>51. Calculate the percentage of specific target cell lysis by NK cells as the following formula:</p><p>Percent cytotoxicity = 100 × Experimental LDH Release (OD<sub>490</sub>) / Maximum LDH Release (OD<sub>490</sub>)</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>Steps 1-11, 120 minutes (2 h).</p><p>Steps 12-27, 420 minutes (7 h).</p><p>Steps 28-32, 180 minutes (3 h).</p><p>Steps 33-39, 15 days.</p><p>Steps 40-51, 240 minutes (4 h).&nbsp;</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p><strong><em>SVF characterization results</em></strong></p><p>AT is composed of heterogeneous cells and an SVF is rich in immune cells, especially NK cells <strong>(Fig 4)</strong>. We compared SVF and adipocyte cell fractions from obese donors to determine if SVF is a major source of lymphocytes in adipose tissue. Abdominal region SVF and adipocyte fractions from minimum seventeen obese females were studied for more confirmation of results.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Expression of NK cell receptors </em></strong></p><p>To test the important receptors status, NK cells was stained before and after our expansion process for CD16, CD56, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46. Some of them were found to have reduced expression, after the activation process <strong>(Fig 5)</strong>. Most notably, CD16 or F<sub>c</sub>γ receptor, which is frequently down regulated during culture, remained constantly expressed during our expansion and activation method <strong>(Fig 5)</strong>. CD16 plays a critical role in lysis of target microorganisms via ADCC.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Killing efficiency of expanded NK cells </em></strong></p><p>NK cells expanded and activated by this protocol were able to kill microorganisms such as gram positive (<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>) and gram negative (<em>Escherichia coli</em>) bacteria. But the results on the malignant cell lines<strong> </strong>was unsuccessful.<strong> </strong>This phenomenon is in relation to the reduced expression of some receptors such as NKp44 and NKG2D on the surface of this population of NKs. &nbsp;</p><h2>References</h2><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheng, M., Chen, Y., Xiao, W., Sun, R., Tian, Z.
