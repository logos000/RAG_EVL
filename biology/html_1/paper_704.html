Church<br>Abstract: <p>This protocol describes the computational steps necessary to reproduce the results described in the paper "<strong>Unified rational protein engineering with sequence-only deep representation learning</strong>" by Alley et al.</p><br>Keywords: machine learning, protein engineering, deep learning<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Rational protein engineering requires a holistic understanding of protein function. Here, we apply deep learning to unlabelled amino acid sequences to distill the fundamental features of a protein into a statistical <em>representation </em>that is semantically rich and structurally, evolutionarily, and biophysically grounded. We show that the simplest models built on top of this <u>uni</u>fied <u>rep</u>resentation (UniRep) are broadly applicable and generalize to unseen regions of sequence space. Our data-driven approach reaches near state-of-the-art or superior performance predicting stability of natural and<em> de novo</em> designed proteins as well as quantitative function of molecularly diverse mutants. UniRep further enables two orders of magnitude cost savings in a protein engineering task. Here we provide a protocol for reproducing these results.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>No reagents necessary</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Preferably, m5.12xlarge or m5.24xlarge&nbsp;AWS instance with Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS AMI (for example, ami-0f65671a86f061fcd).</p><p><br></p><p>Code and dependencies described under "Requirements" in <a href="https://github.com/churchlab/UniRep-analysis" target="_blank">https://github.com/churchlab/UniRep-analysis</a></p><h2>Procedure</h2><p>1.
