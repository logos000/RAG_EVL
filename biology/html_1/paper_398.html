By combining a new strategy for cDNA preparation with PacBio long-read sequencing, FLAM-seq enables to generate hundreds of thousands of reads per sample in an easy and short procedure, with starting material ranging from 500 ng to 10 μg of total RNA. Besides the quantification of gene expression and the information about the mRNA isoform, the data generated with FLAM-seq allow accurate measurement of poly(A) tail length for thousands of genes in the sequenced samples. Here we describe the protocol step by step from the RNA preparation to the first steps of data analysis.</p><br>Keywords: RNA, long reads, full-length mRNA sequencing, poly(A) tails<br><h2>Reagents</h2><p>Truseq mRNA preparation kit (cat.

Briefly, the RNA after poly(A) selection is eluted in 10 μl, GI tailing is performed in 12.5 μl and RNA eluted in 10 μl, cDNA synthesis is performed in 20 μl and eluted in 20 μl, PCR is performed in 50 μl for 23-25 cycles. Moreover, we found that fixing cells with methanol before RNA extraction improves RNA quality and yield for samples of neuronal origin.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><em>Poly(A) versus total RNA</em></p><p>FLAM-seq can be performed with either poly(A)-selected RNA or with ribo-depleted RNA. IN an exploratory analysis, we observed that RNAs with very short tails can be depleted with the poly(A) selection, however they represent a minor population in most biological samples (Figure 1). The advantage of poly(A) selection resides in the fact that PacBio sequencing has low depth compared to other sequencing technologies and poly(A) selection limits the fraction of reads mapping to non-mRNA molecules. Using poly(A)-selected RNA can therefore slightly bias the tail length measurement but allows obtaining enough reads to measure tails for thousands of mRNAs. Since tail length per transcript typically have a highly dispersed distribution, what is the required sequencing depth really depends on the biological questions that one wants to address. For poly(A) selection, we used the Illumina Truseq mRNA preparation kit, however any equivalent oligo-dT-based method is suitable in principle.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><em>GI tailing of RNA</em></p><p>We were able to replace the Thermo Fisher USB poly(A) length assay kit with yeast poly(A) polymerase (Thermo Fisher, 74225Z25KU) fed with equimolar G/I ribonucleotides, which is less expensive. However, we found that the buffer provided with this enzyme is very viscous and apparently incompatible with bead-based purification and downstream reactions. If the user decides for this alternative, we recommend to perform phenol-chloroform extraction followed by precipitation before proceeding with cDNA synthesis.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><em>Library profile</em></p><p>After PCR amplification, we recommend to check the library profile on an Agilent Fragment Analyzer. Fragment size of FLAM-seq libraries usually peaks between 1.5 and 2.5 kb, depending on the sample quality and the 5’ coverage of the amplified cDNAs (Figure 2a). Transcript coverage can be biased towards the 3’ ends, especially for mRNAs larger than ~ 1.5 kb, as reported in the associated publication. We found that increasing RT incubation to 90 minutes and PCR elongation to 5-7 minutes improves library size, but can yield more PCR artifacts depending on the RNA sample quality and amount. When optimizing FLAM-seq, we found that libraries often contained a significant fraction of PCR artifacts, generated by multiple rounds of concatenation of the template switch oligo with the RT primer and resulting in a ladder-like profile of the final library (an extreme example in Figure 2b). To avoid this issue, we introduced a size-selection and purification step after RT and PCR, as well as an anchored dC primer and a modified template switch oligo (with isonucleotides on its 5’ end) for the reverse transcription. If the final library still contains low-size concatemers, we recommend to increase the RNA input and introduce a stricter size-selection for long fragments after cDNA preparation.</p><p><br></p><p> </p><p><em>Data analysis</em></p><p> The analysis pipeline that we provide discards many reads from the original sequencing output: if the library had a good size profile, still roughly 50% of the reads are typically discarded as they do not contain a poly(A) tail or one of the adapter sequences or they do not uniquely map to the genome. The PacBio Sequel system can provide up to one million reads per SMRT cell, with productively sequenced molecules typically in the range of 200,000 per SMRT cell. In our experience, 2 or 3 SMRT cells per sample are usually required for the basic analyses provided in our associated publication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></body></html>
