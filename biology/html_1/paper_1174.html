Here, we create multi-layered normal bladder assembloids and tumour assembloids by reconstituting tissue stem cell/tumour cell-derived organoids with multiple stromal components to represent an organized tissue architecture and functionality of adult bladder, and to mimic <em>in vivo</em> pathophysiological features of patient-derived urothelial carcinoma, respectively. Our assembloid model will facilitate development of an innovative model system for studying tissue regeneration and tumourigenesis at molecular and cellular levels, and also provide a unique experimental tool for establishing novel personalized therapeutic options, such as new drug screening strategies that are customized for different stages and types of cancer in individual patients.</p><br>Keywords: Bladder organoid, bladder assembloid, bladder tumour organoid, tissue stroma, tumour microenvironment, bladder cancer, tumour plasticity<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Organoids are derived from three major cell types: tissue-restricted adult stem cells, pluripotent stem cells and, in the case of tumour organoids, tumour cells (reviewed in<sup>3,4</sup>). These organoids are widely used for modelling key characteristics of organs and tissues to better understand various aspects of human disease such as cancer. However, current organoids are still limited because such model systems fail to account for a large number of factors, including native tissue architecture and surrounding microenvironment<sup>1,2,5</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we report the 3D reconstitution of normal bladder and patient-specific bladder tumour “assembloids” - organoids derived from tissue stem/tumour cells reconstituted with other components of the tissue stroma/microenvironment such as stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and muscle cells.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Cells</strong></p><p>·	Long-term cultured (&gt; 6 months) mouse bladder organoids</p><p>·	Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF)</p><p>·	HULEC</p><p>·	Mouse bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMC)</p><p>·	Human bladder tumor organoids</p><p>·	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reagents</strong></p><p>·	DMEM (Welgene, # LM001-07)</p><p>·	FBS (Merck, # ES009B-KC)</p><p>·	Penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, # 15140122)</p><p>·	Advanced DMEM/F-12 (Gibco, # 12634028)</p><p>·	HEPES (Sigma, # H3375)</p><p>·	Nicotinamide (Sigma, # 3376)</p><p>·	N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Sigma, #A9165)</p><p>·	GlutaMAX™ Supplement (Gibco, # 35050061)</p><p>·	Recombinant mouse EGF (Peprotech, # 315-09)</p><p>·	50X B-27 supplement (Gibco, #17505-044)</p><p>·	A8301 (Tocris, # 2939)</p><p>·	Growth factor reduced, Matrigel (Corning, # FAL-354230)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>·	12-well Not treated culture plates (Corning, # 351143)</p><p>·	Hemocytometer (Marienfeld, # 0640010)</p><p>·	Parafilm (Sigma, # P7543)</p><p>·	Microcentrifuge tube (Axygen, # MCT-150-C)</p><p>·	15 ml tube (SPL, # 50015)</p><p>·	35 mm petri-dish (SPL, # 10035)</p><p>·	100 mm petri-dish (SPL, # 10090)</p><p>·	Spray bottle containing 70% (vol/vol) ethanol</p><p>·	Sterilized scissors</p><p>·	Fine forceps</p><p>·	Centrifuge</p><p>·	12-well version of spinning reactor or Orbital shaker</p><p>·	Biosafety cabinet</p><p>·	CO<sub>2</sub> incubator</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>* Perform every step in the biosafety cabinet</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Generation of normal mouse bladder assembloids</strong></p><p>* This protocol is standardized to a preparation of culture in 2 wells of 12-well plate (= 10 assembloids).</p><p>*&nbsp;A day before,&nbsp;thaw 60 µl of Matrigel<strong>&nbsp;</strong>overnight at 4 °C.</p><p>* Prepare long-term (&gt; 6 months) bladder organoids, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), HULEC, bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMC) cultures in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>1.
