Surgical resection of CLM is the only treatment that significantly prolongs their survival<sup>2</sup>. Nevertheless, a multidisciplinary approach has been recommended for the treatment of CLM as the best strategy to achieve synergy in the efficiency of all treatments<sup>3</sup>. One of these strategies includes cancer immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors<sup>4</sup>, which has proven to achieve durable clinical effects in some patients with advanced disease in some types of cancer<sup>5</sup>. In CRC, only patients with deficient mismatch repair respond to these treatments<sup>4</sup>. There are various immune-suppressive and tumor-promoting mechanisms, which are directly related to the unresponsiveness to cancer immunotherapy<sup>6</sup>. Traditionally, the techniques used for current stratification of CLM patients are immunohistochemistry<sup>7,8</sup> and flow cytometry<sup>9</sup>, which provide limited information about composition, location and phenotypic characterization and functional relationships of immune and stroma cells within the tumor and the adjacent liver parenchyma. Therefore a better analysis is warranted to deconvolute the complexity within the tumor immune microenvironment and to reveal informative biomarkers that will aid the current stratification of CLM patients for available therapies and particularly immunotherapies<sup>10</sup>.</p><p><br></p><p>Techniques such&nbsp;as Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and automated image quantitation analysis, enable a deeper understanding of the diversity of the host’s anti-tumor immune response by identifying the key players that may inhibit anti-tumor T-cell responses and T-cell infiltration into the tumor tissue<sup>10-14</sup>.

Use inForm® software v2.4.2 Cell segmentation and phenotyping algorithm to calculate cell count per HPF according to the trainable phenotypes of interest: CD3+&nbsp;T Lymphocytes (CD3+ CD8-CD103-), CD8+ T cells (CD3+CD8+CD103-), TRM (CD3+CD8+CD103+), T regulatory cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>) , non T cells expressing CD8+ or CD103+&nbsp;and cells expressing EMT markers such as α-SMA or E-cadherin.

The specificity of the antibodies have been independently validated in specimens of sclerosed hemangiomas and benign liver tissues. This novel panel mIHC allows the characterization of conventional and unconventional T-cells contained within the CD3<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, which may offer insights into novel biomarkers for CLM post liver resection and immune surveillance. We raise the possibility of discovering novel phenotypes and potential immune targets that can be modulated by available cancer immunotherapy.&nbsp;</p><h2>References</h2><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keum N, Giovannucci E.
