Klima, Cameron M. Chow, Jiayi Dou, Anastassia A. Vorobieva, Lauren Carter, David Baker<br>Abstract: <p>Bacterial expression and purification of <em>de novo</em> designed mini-fluorescence-activating proteins (mFAPs) are accomplished by genetically fusing mFAP variants to an N-terminal 6xHis tag and optionally to a Tobacco Etch Virus <em>(</em>TEV) protease epitope. The protocol can take less than 24 hours to complete, and allows for downstream <em>in vitro</em> characterization of photophysical properties of mFAPs by equilibration with exogenous fluorogenic compounds.</p><br>Keywords: bacterial expression, protein purification<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p><em>De novo</em> designed mini-fluorescence-activating proteins<sup>1</sup> (mFAPs) are

For expression of 6xHis-tagged proteins encoded on pET15b or pET29b(+) vectors in Lemo21(DE3) <em>E. coli</em>, either a single colony from an agar plate, 25.0 μL of overnight-grown culture, or 25.0 μL of a 20% glycerol culture stock is inoculated into 50.0 mL, 500 mL, or 1.00 L of lysogeny broth (LB) media or Terrific Broth II (TBII) media supplemented with 50.0 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> carbenicillin (pET15b) or 50.0-100.0 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> kanamycin (pET29b(+)) at final concentration.</p><p>2. To induce protein expression, cells are grown at 37°C shaking at 200-250 rotations per minute (rpm) overnight (16-22 hours) with 500 µM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) final concentration added either prior to inoculation or 4 hours prior to harvesting cells.</p><p>3. Cells are harvested by centrifugation at 3,000-4,000x<em>g</em> for 10 minutes at 4°C.</p><p>4. Cell pellets are resuspended in 20.0-30.0 mL of either lysis buffer #1 supplemented with 1.00 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup> phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and a small amount of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), lysis buffer #2, or lysis buffer #3.</p><p>5. Cells are lysed via either sonication at 40-70% amplitude, FastPrep-96 at 1,600 rpm with glass beads, or cell disruption using a microfluidizer at 18,000 psi.</p><p>6. Crude cell lysates are centrifuged at 24,000x<em>g</em> for 30-60 minutes at 4˚C.</p><p>7. To purify clarified cell lysates via gravity Ni-NTA immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), 2.00 mL of Ni-NTA agarose resin is pre-equilibrated with 10.0 mL of either lysis buffer #1, wash buffer #2, or wash buffer #3.</p><p>8. Clarified cell lysate is loaded onto the column and the flow-through is collected.</p><p>9. The column is washed 1-3 times with 20.0 mL of either wash buffer #1, wash buffer #2, or wash buffer #3.</p><p>10. The proteins are eluted from the column in 5.00-15.0 mL of either elution buffer #1, elution buffer #2, or elution buffer #3 and the eluates are collected.</p><p>11a. For keeping 6xHis tags intact, IMAC-purified proteins are buffer exchanged into high salt Tev cleavage buffer or low salt Tev cleavage buffer using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units. Proceed to step 14.</p><p>11b. For removing 6xHis tags, IMAC-purified proteins are concentrated to ~1.0 mL using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units, 1.0-5.0 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup> 6xHis-tagged Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV-6xHis) protease is added at a ~1:100 dilution, and the reaction is incubated at 25°C overnight. Proceed to step 12.</p><p>12. TEV-6xHis protease is removed via secondary Ni-NTA IMAC purification, eluting proteins in 5.00 mL of lysis buffer #1 or lysis buffer #2.</p><p>13. Cleaved protein is concentrated in Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units.</p><p>14. Protein concentrations are measured using either a QuBit 2.0 and QuBit Protein Assay Kit or a NanoDrop 8000 with extinction coefficients predicted from amino acid sequence using the ProtParam tool<sup>2</sup> or Biopython module<sup>3</sup>.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC).</em></p><p>1. IMAC-purified proteins are prepared at ≥1 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup> and applied to a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column or Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column on a LC 1200 Series high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) machine for separation of IMAC-purified proteins based on molecular size.</p><p>2. SEC-purified proteins are eluted in either high salt Tev cleavage buffer, Tris buffered saline (TBS), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), or Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline without calcium or magnesium (DPBS) (Thermo Scientific).</p><p>3. Monomeric protein fractions are collected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units with 3 kDa cutoff.</p><p>4. Protein concentrations are measured as in step 14 of "Large-scale bacterial expression and protein purification."</p><p><br></p><p><em>Small-scale bacterial expression and protein purification.</em></p><p>1. 25.0 μL of overnight-grown cultures of Lemo21(DE3) <em>E. coli</em> are inoculated into each well of Nunc 2.0 mL DeepWell 96-well plates containing 1.00 mL of LB media supplemented with 50.0 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> carbenicillin (pET15b) final concentration, and plates are sealed with adhesive Breathe-easy film covers. Optionally, 2-8 replicate plates are prepared to optimize purified protein yields.</p><p>2. Cells are grown at 37°C and shaken at 1,200 rpm for 3-4 hours.</p><p>3. 500 µM IPTG final concentration is added to each well.</p><p>4. Protein expression is induced for 4 hours at 37°C shaken at 1,200 rpm.</p><p>5. Cells are pelleted at 2,272x<em>g</em> for 2-5 minutes in a plate centrifuge.</p><p>6. Pellets are resuspended in 50.0 μL of lysis buffer #1 supplemented with 1.00 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup> PMSF and a small amount of DNase I, combining pellets of any replicate plates.</p><p>7. Cells are transferred to skirted 96-well polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plates and sealed with adhesive foil covers for cell lysis via a microplate sonicator at 40-60% amplitude for 2-4 minutes in an ice bath.</p><p>8. Crude cell lysates are centrifuged at 2,272x<em>g</em>&nbsp;for 5 minutes in a plate centrifuge.</p><p>9. Clarified cell lysates are applied to His MultiTrap HP 96-well plates pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer #1, and IMAC purification undergone following the manufacturer's protocol for purification except resin is washed three times in wash buffer #1 and eluted three times, each time using 50.0 μL of elution buffer #1.</p><p>10. Eluates are consolidated into a single 96-well PCR plate.</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p><em>Large-scale bacterial expression and protein purification –&nbsp;</em>18-48 hours</p><p><em>Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) – </em>30-60 minutes</p><p><em>Small-scale bacterial expression and protein purification – </em>8-10 hours</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>IMAC-purified and SEC-purified protein samples for downstream&nbsp;<em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;characterization.</p><h2>References</h2><p>1.
