Spencer, Teagan Paton, Timothy J.J. Inglis, J. Mark Sutton, Hywel Morgan<br>Abstract: <p>There is an urgent need to develop simple and fast antimicrobial susceptibility tests that allow informed prescribing of antibiotics. In this protocol we describe a method for a label-free AST that can deliver results within an hour, using an actively dividing culture as starting material.</p><br>Keywords: antimicrobial susceptibility test, impedance, cytometry, single cell analysis<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In this protocol an actively dividing bacterial isolate is incubated in the presence of the antibiotic for 30 minutes, and then approximately 10<sup>5</sup> cells are analysed one-by-one with microfluidic impedance cytometry for 2-3 minutes. The measured electrical characteristics reflect the phenotypic response of the bacteria to the mode of action of a particular antibiotic, in a 30-minute incubation window.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><u>Cell media</u></p><p>Tryptic soy broth (TSB)&nbsp;<em>[Sigma: 22092]</em></p><p>Cation Adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) <em>[Sigma: 90922]</em></p><p>Hanks media&nbsp;<em>[Sigma: H6648]</em></p><p>Agar plates <em>[Sigma L5542]</em></p><p><br></p><p><u>Antibiotics</u></p><p>Meropenem <em>[Sigma M2574]</em></p><p>Colistin <em>[Sigma 1148001]</em></p><p>Gentamicin <em>[Sigma G4918] </em></p><p>Ciprofloxacin – <em>[Sigma 17850]</em></p><p>Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid <em>[Sigma A8523 and Sigma 33454]</em></p><p>Cefoxitin <em>[Sigma 1098107]</em></p><p><br></p><p><u>Reference Particles</u></p><p>Polybead® Microspheres 1.50μm <em>[Polysciences 17133-15]</em></p><p><br></p><p><u>Bacterial isolates</u></p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> strain 43358</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> strain ATCC 700603</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain 18397</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain 43292</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> strain 44271</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> strain KS1</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> strain KS11</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> strain K1</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> strain 1705</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> strain K14</p><p><em>Acinetobacter baumannii </em>strain NCTC 13424</p><p><em>Acinetobacter baumannii </em>strain ATCC 17978</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain 51851</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain NCTC 13368</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain CFI-014</p><p><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>strain NCTC 13437</p><p><em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>strain PA01</p><p><em>Escherichia coli </em>strain CFL 161</p><p><em>Escherichia coli </em>strain NCTC 12923</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain51851</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain NCTC 13438</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain 51851</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain TW3</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain NCTC 13368</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain M6</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain NCTC 13368</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain NCTC 5054</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain NCTC 13438</p><p><em>Klebsiella pneumoniae </em>strain M6</p><p><em>Escherichia coli </em>strain LEC001</p><p><em>Escherichia coli </em>strain NCTC 12923</p><p><em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>strain NCTC 13616</p><p><em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>strain NCTC 6571</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>--Zurich Instruments HF2IS impedance analyser (Zurich Instruments AG, Zurich, Switzerland)</p><p>--Shaking incubator set to 36-37<sup>o</sup>C with an air atmosphere.</p><p>--Vortex mixer for falcon and eppendorf tubes</p><p>--Single cell impedance cytometer glass chips.

This is sample A.</p><p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Add a 1uL aliquot of sample A to an eppendorf containing 1mL Hanks media and vortex for 1 minute to ensure the sample is thoroughly mixed.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Dilute sample A 1000-fold (1uL in 1mL Hanks) and measure the concentration of cells using the impedance cytometer (see impedance cytometer measurements section later for further details).</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Take an aliquot of sample A and dilute such that the final concentration (called sample B) is 5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL; From step 3, if the concentration of sample A is <em>N</em> cells/mL, add a volume of sample A given by <em>V</em>= <em>N</em> / 5x10<sup>6</sup> (uL) to 10mL MHB, such that the final concentration (called sample B) is 5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. Typically sample A will be between 10<sup>8</sup> and 10<sup>9</sup> cells/mL, and therefore the volume <em>V</em> will be between 10-100uL.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Incubate sample B in a shaking incubator for 30 minutes at 37<sup>o</sup>C.</p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Add aliquots (950uL) to 7 pre-warmed test tubes each containing 50uL MHB and Meropenem at a concentration of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 mg/L of meropenem (final antibiotic concentration is 20x lower; i.e. 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/L.)</p><p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Incubate the tubes for 30 minutes at 37<sup>o</sup>C.</p><p><strong>Step 8. </strong>Wash the cells and resuspend in Hanks media (spin at 10,000*g for 5 minutes, remove the supernatant and top up to 1mL)</p><p><strong>Step 9. </strong>Dilute each sample 1:10 (add 100uL from each of the 7 eppendorfs to 7 new eppendorfs containing 900uL Hanks).</p><p><strong>Step 10. </strong>Add a volume of concentrated bead suspension that contains approximately 10<sup>4 </sup>polystyrene beads (1.5um diameter) to each eppendorf.</p><p><strong>Step 11. </strong>Load the contents of each tube into a 1mL syringe and measure with the impedance cytometer (see later).</p><p><br></p><p><u>Protocol 2.</u></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Streak out a 10uL loop from a frozen glycerol stock onto an agar plate. Place the plate into an incubator overnight at 37<sup>o</sup>C.</p><p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Pick three typical colonies from the plate and add to 3mL of MHB - this is sample A.</p><p><strong>Step 3. </strong>Vortex sample A for 1 minute to ensure that it is well mixed.</p><p><strong>Step 4. </strong>Dilute sample A 400-fold (2.5uL in 1mL Hanks) and measure using the impedance cytometer to determine the concentration of the bacteria in sample A (see impedance cytometer measurements section later for further details).</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Assuming the concentration of sample A is <em>N</em> cells/mL, add a volume of sample A given by <em>V</em>=<em>N</em> / 15x10<sup>5</sup> uL to 3mL MHB, such that the final concentration (called sample B) is 5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. Typically sample A will be approximately 10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL, and therefore the volume <em>V</em> will be approximately 15uL.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Incubate sample B in a shaking incubator for 30 minutes at 37<sup>o</sup>C.</p><p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Add aliquots (500uL) to pre-warmed test tubes each containing 500uL MHB and an antibiotic. Concentrations of antibiotics are 4mg/L and 32mg/L for Meropenem , 2 mg/L for ciprofloxacin, 16 mg/L for gentamicin, 8 mg/L for Colistin, 16 mg/L for ceftazidime, along with a control (no antibiotic).&nbsp;Final concentrations of antibiotics will be half the above concentrations.</p><p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Incubate the tubes for 30 minutes at 37<sup>o</sup>C.</p><p><strong>Step 9. </strong>Dilute each sample 1:10 (add 100uL to an new eppendorfs containing 900uL Hanks media).</p><p><strong>Step 10. </strong>Add a volume of concentrated bead suspension that contains approximately 10<sup>4 </sup>polystyrene beads (1.5um diameter) to each eppendorf.</p><p><strong>Step 11. </strong>Load the contents of each tube into a 1mL syringe and measure with the impedance cytometer (see</p><p><br></p><p><u>Single cell impedance cytometry measurements</u></p><p><strong>Step 1. </strong>Load the sample into a 1mL syringe.</p><p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Connect the syringe to the impedance cytometer tubing.</p><p><strong>Step 3. </strong>Insert the syringe into a syringe pump.</p><p><strong>Step 4. </strong>Start the syringe running at 30uL/min.</p><p><strong>Step 5. </strong>Start the ziControl software which controls the Zurich Instruments impedance analyser, and apply a measurement voltage (see measurement settings below).</p><p><strong>Step 6. </strong>Record data for 2-3 minutes (depending on the required number of bacteria to measure).</p><p><strong>Step 7. </strong>Turn off the measurement voltage.</p><p><strong>Step 8. </strong>Flush through with a suitable cleaning reagent (e.g. buffer, NaOH, NaClO).</p><p>Repeat steps 1-8 for each remaining sample.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Measurement settings (ziControl)</u></p><p>Sample rate: 230k samples/second</p><p>Applied frequencies: 5MHz and 40MHz</p><p>Applied voltage: 2v pk-pk</p><p><br></p><p><u>Data analysis</u></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Determine the impedance of each particle by extracting the peak signal amplitude using convolution for each applied frequency.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Determine the mean signal of the 1.5um beads</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Normalise the opacity-cell size scatterplot by a single linear multiplier for each axis to ensure the mean of the beads is at Opacity =1 and diameter = 1.5um.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Define a contour is defined around the population of cells not exposed to antibiotic. This is termed the unexposed contour should include 50% of the cell population.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> For each antibiotic exposed sample, normalise the data (as per step 3) and determine the number of cells that fall within the unexposed contour.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Single cell impedance cytometer chip fabrication</u></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Deposit 10nm titanium and the 200nm platinum onto two 6 inch glass substrates</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Spin-coat a suitable photoresist (e.g. S1813) and pattern by exposure to UV light through a 7 inch photomask</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Develop the resist by washing with a suitable resist developer.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Pattern the meta layers using Ion beam milling.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>. Strip the photoresist.</p><p><strong>Step 6. </strong>Spin-coat SU-8 to the desired channel thickness (e.g. 30um) on to one of the two patterned wafers</p><p><strong>Step 7. </strong>Expose to UV light through a 7 inch photomask and develop.</p><p><strong>Step 8. </strong>Align and bond the second wafer to the first wafer&nbsp;by vacuum bonding at 180°C, 10kN for 6 hours.</p><p><strong>Step 9.</strong> Carefully scribe and dice the wafer to release the individual cytometer chips.</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>If the microcytometer chip gets blocked, try flushing with buffer from outlet back to the inlet. If this is unsuccessful, replace with a new chip. If the cytometer is frequently clogging, filter all reagents with a 0.22um (sterile) filter. </p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>A populations of beta-lactam exposed cells from an isolate that is <strong>sensitive </strong>to the antibiotic are expected to <strong>increase</strong><em> </em>in low-frequency impedance and <strong>decrease </strong>in electrical opacity relative to an unexposed sample of the same isolate.
