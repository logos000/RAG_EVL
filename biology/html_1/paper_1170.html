Thus, we developed a protocol to extract, identify, and quantify the SCFAs of silages. The proposed method was tested with satisfactory results in corn silages. Despite literature findings suggest that the most common instrumental method for determining SCFAs is the gas chromatography technique, the liquid chromatography technique using both C18 column and ion-exchange columns can be proposed as analytical technique for SCFAs determination as well. The use of the C18 column in HPLC-DAD has a particular limitation because it does not allow efficient separation of butyric and iso-butyric acids. However, considering that the concentration of iso-butyric acid in silages is significantly lower than that of butyric acid, a good estimation of butyric acid can be obtained.</p><br>Keywords: fatty acid extraction, feedstuff, HPLC, volatile fatty acid<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The ruminant production systems around the world are strongly based on the intake of forages. In addition, it is known that climatic conditions (mainly temperature and rainfall distribution) influence the growth and productivity of pastures. Hence, changes of climate conditions across the year, determine the availability of forages with adequate nutritional quality for ruminant production. This condition may impair ruminant health, production, and reproduction. Thus, the use of forage conservation techniques is a common strategy in livestock systems to overcome this limitation.</p><p>One of the most common forage preservation techniques uses a combination of both anaerobic and acidic environments. This technique is known as ensiling and the feedstuff produced is defined as silage. The ensiling process intends to preserve the nutritional quality of the original forage or vegetal feed source, extending the nutritional availability of forage to different periods in the year.</p><p>The nutritional quality of silages can be evaluated using different parameters. Among these parameters, the evaluation of the short-chain fatty acids (SFCAs) profile constitutes a suitable choice for quality evaluation due to the SFCAs profile and the nutritional composition of the silage are correlated.</p><p>In silages, the SFCAs profile may be composed of lactic, acetic, propionic, butyric, iso-butyric, 2-methyl butyric, valeric, isovaleric, caproic, and caprylic acids, whose concentrations may vary according to the forage source, as well as potential physical or chemical treatments applied during ensiling. Hence, this protocol aimed to describe a method to extract, identify, and quantify SFCAs in silages, using RP-HPLC-DAD as a quantification technique.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>3.1 Extraction solution:</strong></p><p><em>Solution of ortho-phosphoric acid 0.85% (v/v): </em>add to a 100 mL class A volumetric flask, 1 mL of ortho-phosphoric acid 85%, and complete to 100 mL with Milli-Q water.</p><p><strong>3.2 Mobile phase components for HPLC running:</strong></p><p><em>3.2.1 Phase A:</em> sodium phosphate buffer solution 10 mM (pH = 2.6) (1 L): weigh 0.78 g of Sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (Sigma Aldrich ®) and mix them with 0.34 mL of 85% ortho-phosphoric acid in a beaker.

Considering that the concentration of lactic acid in solution C is approximately equal to 10 mM, prepare 6 chromatographic vials and add to each one, the Solution C and Milli-Q water quantities, as described in Figure 1.</p><p>3.3.2 Preparation of the calibration curve from 2 to 10 mM of SCFAs using a commercial mix SCFAs mixture (CRM46975, Sigma Aldrich): Considering that the concentration of each SCFAs in the commercial mixture is equal to 10 mM, prepare 5 chromatographic vials and add to each one, the commercial mixture and Milli-Q water quantities, as described in Figure 2.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>- HPLC equipped with an autosampler, Hypersil GOLD C18 column, Hypersil GOLD C18 guard column, a column oven, and a Diode Array Detector.</p><p>- Centrifuge (reaching a minimum of both 10,000 x G and 4 ºC).</p><p>- Freezer (minimum temperature of -20 ºC).</p><p>- Analytical balance.</p><p>- Centrifuge tubes of at least 5 mL of capacity.</p><p>- Blender machine.</p><p>- Transfer pipettes from 100 uL to 5 mL plus tips.</p><p>- 100 mL class A volumetric pipette</p><p>- Pipetter pump.</p><p>- Whatman Uniflo syringe membrane filters of 0.45 um (PES membrane).</p><p>- 5 mL plastic syringes.</p><p>- Chromatographic vials with septa.</p><p>- Vacuum filtration equipment.</p><p>- PYREX™ Gooch Type Filtering Crucibles.</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>5.1 Extraction of short-chain fatty acids in silage:</strong></p><p>1.

However, the Hypersil GOLD C18 column allows an efficient SCFAs separation, except for butyric and iso-butyric acids. This condition may constitute a limitation of the Hypersil GOLD C18 column use for SCFAs determination. However, considering that the concentration of iso-butyric acid is significantly lower in silages, a good estimation of butyric acid can be obtained with the reported method herein.</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>1. According to Hypersil GOLD C18 column manufacturer, the secure pH range of buffer use is between 2 – 8. Therefore, in case of future optimizations of this chromatographic method, the use of solvents or mobile phases with a pH out of this range must be avoided to preserve the activity of the stationary phase.</p><p>2. The column used in the proposed method does not allow the use of 100% aqueous mobile phases (example: the use of solutions of inorganic acids). Therefore, in the case of future optimizations of this method, the use of a mobile phase 100% aqueous must be avoided.</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>- Mobile phase Reagent preparations: 10 min (for 50 samples).</p><p>- Sample preparation: 30 min (for one sample). </p><p>- Calibration curve preparation: 242 min for developing the calibration curves (for 50 samples) </p><p>- HPLC-DAD set-up and stabilization: 15 min (for 50 samples). </p><p>- HPLC-DAD sample run time: 22 min (for one sample). </p><p>- Data analysis: 5 min (for one sample).</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>The successful identification of lactic and acetic acids, as well as propionic acid (main fatty acids in common silage samples), are presented in Figure 4.
