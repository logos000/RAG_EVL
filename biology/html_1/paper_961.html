Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) and single protein tracking (SPT) techniques reveal the dynamic organization of proteins at the nanoscale. In parallel, stretchable substrates are used to investigate cellular responses to mechanical forces. However, simultaneous combination of SRM/SPT and cell stretching has never been achieved. Here, we present a cell stretching device compatible with SRM and SPT, composed of an ultra-thin Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer. The PDMS sheet is gliding on a glycerol-lubricated glass cover-slip to ensure flatness during uniaxial stretching, generated with a 3D-printed micromechanical device by a mobile arm connected to a piezoelectric translator. This method enables to obtain super-resolved images of protein reorganization after live stretching, and to monitor single protein deformation and recruitment inside mechanosensitive structures upon stretching. This protocol is related to the publication ‘Cell stretching is amplified by active actin remodeling to deform and recruit proteins in mechanosensitive structures’, in Nature Cell Biology. </p><p><br></p><br>Keywords: mechanobiology, mechanosensing, focal adhesions, cytoskeleton,cell stretching,super-resolution microscopy, single particle tracking<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>	Growing evidence demonstrates that macromolecular assemblies driving critical cellular functions are regulated by mechanical forces. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of force-sensing within most macromolecular assemblies in cells are still unknown. Several innovative techniques allow to measure and generate forces on proteins <em>in vitro</em> or within cells <sup>1–4</sup>, but they cannot probe protein mechanical responses within crowded macromolecular structures inside the cell or confined at the interface with the extracellular environment.</p><p>	Super-resolution microscopy (SRM) and single protein tracking (SPT) techniques are ideal to study the dynamic organization of proteins at the nanoscale. There are two major classes of SRM: coordinate stochastic based on Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM: PALM, STORM, PAINT) <sup>5–7</sup>; or coordinate targeted (STED, RESOLFT)<sup>5–7</sup>. SRM and SPT confirmed, together with fluorescent tension-sensors, that proteins could be stretched under mechanical tension<sup>2,8–10</sup> in mechanosensitive structures. In parallel, stretchable substrates of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) have been coupled with optical imaging to investigate cell responses to external forces<sup>1,11,12</sup>.&nbsp;However, the simultaneous combination of SRM or SPT with cell stretching is extremely challenging, since it requires to combine glass-like optical properties with mechanical stability of the imaged plane during substrate deformation. </p><p>	SMLM/SPT require the optimal signal to noise ratio of single molecules emission to attain the best spatial resolution (typically 10-50 nm)<sup>5–7</sup>. SMLM/SPT techniques are thus ideally performed in the total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) or oblique illumination modes using high numerical aperture (NA) short working distance oil immersion objectives matching the index of refraction of glass slides<sup>5–7,13,14</sup>. In addition, SMLM/SPT techniques rely on object reconstruction or tracking from thousands of imaging planes, which implies perfect mechanical stability of the sample while imaging. This is incompatible with large deformations and displacements of the substrate in the axis (Z) and plane (XY) of observation during stretching. </p><p>	Similarly, coordinate targeted STED/RESOLFT nanoscopy techniques perform better using high numerical aperture (NA) short working distance oil immersion or glycerol immersion objectives. Compared to SMLM/SPT techniques, STED like techniques will be less sensitive to drift, as they have low pixel dwell times<sup>15,16</sup>. However, mechanical drift stemming from multiple factors (e.g., motorized and piezoelectric stages) can greatly compromise the performance of the STED system, degrading signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution<sup>15,16</sup>. Thus, perfect mechanical stability of the sample has to be ensured throughout acquisitions. Once again, this could be incompatible with large XYZ deformations during stretching.&nbsp;</p><p>	In most commercial configurations, cell stretching is performed using macroscopic devices and images are acquired after fixation, or thick elastomeric substrates are stretched in combination with low NA objectives and upright microscopes<sup>17,18</sup>. These low magnification configurations are quite permissive to slight defocusing <sup>19</sup>. Various custom-made devices could potentially enable simultaneous stretching and live cell imaging <sup>1,11,19–22</sup>. However, they are either limited to low-magnification imaging or are incompatible with continuous automatic focusing during stretching</p><p>	Here, we present a cell stretching device compatible with SRM and SPT which enables to study the nanoscale reorganizations and deformations of protein assembly or individual proteins inside mechanosensitive structures<sup>23</sup> (Fig. 1a). This device is composed of an ultra-thin Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer (10 µm) providing glass-like optical properties compatible with SRM and SPT (Fig. 1b,c). To simultaneously enable substrate stretching and ensure flatness upon deformation, this ultra-thin PDMS layer is deposited on a glycerol-lubricated glass cover-slip (Fig. 1b,c). Glycerol allows the deformable substrate to float freely while avoiding PDMS adhesion and refractive index mismatch.&nbsp;A drop of glycerol is sandwiched between the plasma cleaned PDMS sheet and glass coverslip forming a glycerol layer of ∼ 0.7 µm in thickness (Fig. 1c) To manipulate the thin PDMS substrate and avoid any distortions along the optical path, the size of the observation chamber is kept as small as possible (∼9 mm2 (Fig. 1b)), and its mechanical stability is reinforced by adding a thicker (40 µm) Gel-Pak frame on top of the thin PDMS sheet (Fig. 1c). To generate uniaxial stretches on the glass-PDMS assembly, we design a 3D-printed micro-device (Fig. 1a,b). The micromechanical device consists of a fixed (holding) arm and a mobile (stretching) arm, connected to a piezo motor, positioned on opposite sides of the observation chamber on the PDMS frame (Fig. 1a,b). A clamp fixes the glass-PDMS slide to the base of the device and to the holding arm (Fig. 1a). The observation chamber or the whole microchip can be filled with culture or observation medium.</p><p>	Our micromechanical stretching device is compatible with the two major classes of SRM: coordinate stochastic (e.g. PALM, STORM, PAINT) and coordinate targeted (e.g. STED)<sup>5–7,24</sup> (Fig.2). Experiments can be divided into two main approaches: 1) live stretching and SRM/SPT imaging in live cells (Fig. 2a-c) and 2) live stretching followed by rapid fixation, labelling and SRM imaging (Fig.2d,e). </p><p>	Concerning the first approach, we can perform SPT acquisitions in cells before and after large (10-50%) or small (2-5%) stretches to study the effect of external stress on protein dynamics and diffusive properties (Fig. 2a). In addition, we can also perform simultaneous live cell stretching (2-5%) and SPT to study acute mechanical response of individual proteins: 1) force-dependent protein unfolding or deformations (Fig. 2b); or 2) force-dependent protein recruitments and reorganizations. Finally, the device can also be used to acquire STED SRM images of live cells that experience stretching (Fig. 2c). Regarding the second approach, the device can be used to perform SRM (e.g. DNA-PAINT, STED, STORM) in fixed cells after live stretching (2-50 %) followed by rapid fixation and labelling for SRM (Fig. 2d,e). </p><p><br></p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Reagents for assembling the micromechanical device </strong></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PDMS (Sylgard 184, Samaro, Cat.

As for the resin, we recommend using Grey Pro resin because it offers high precision, moderate elongation, and low creep (https://formlabs.com/eu/materials/engineering/#grey-pro-resinGrey Pro Resin).

Here, an inverted motorized microscope (Nikon Ti) was used, equipped with a CFI Apo TIRF 100x oil, NA 1.49 objective and a perfect focus system PFS-2), allowing long acquisition in TIRF illumination mode. For photoactivation localization microscopy, cells expressing mEos2/tdEos tagged constructs were photoactivated using a 405 nm laser (Omicron) and the resulting photoconverted single molecule fluorescence was excited with a 561 nm laser (Cobolt Jive). Both lasers illuminated the sample simultaneously. Their respective power was adjusted to keep the number of the stochastically activated molecules constant and well separated during the acquisition. Fluorescence was collected by the combination of a dichroic and emission filters (dichroic: Di01-R561, emission: FF01-617/73, Semrock) and a sensitive EMCCD (electron-multiplying charge-coupled device, Evolve, Photometric). The acquisition was steered by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) in streaming mode at 50 Hz. GFP-paxillin was imaged using a conventional GFP filter cube (excitation: FF01-472/30, dichroic: FF-495Di02, emission: FF02-520/28, Semrock). </p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>For simultaneous stretching and sptPALM with trapeze like patterns</u>: select a cell and launch a PALM acquisition at high frequency (50 Hz) for the entire field of observation.

The confocal microscope was equipped of a white light laser 2 (WLL2) with freely tuneable excitation from 470 to 670 nm (1 nm steps). Scanning was done using a conventional scanner (10Hz to 1800 Hz). The confocal microscope was equipped with the STED module tunable to STED microscopy. A two-dimensional (2D) STED donut was generated using a vortex phase plate. This STED microscope was equipped with 3 depletion lasers: 592 nm, 660 nm and 775 nm For STED microscopy, cells were imaged with a combination of a WLL2 laser and a 775 nm depletion laser. Fluorescence was collected with an internal hybrid detector. The acquisition was steered by LASX Software (Leica).</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform live labelling of the target protein on the micromechanical device. For actin or tubulin labelling, use SiR-Actin or SiR-Tubulin compounds, according to previous studies and manufacturer’s instructions <sup>25</sup>. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the labelling, wash the staining solution and incubate the device in warm Ringer solution until the experiment. </p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After bead incubation and mounting of the sample as previously described, select a cell and acquire a confocal image followed by a STED image on a sub region of the cell (pixel size has to be inferior to 20 µm). </p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretch the cell according to the desired percentage (e.g. 4 or 30%) and maintain the cell on the field of observation by observation by compensating for XY displacements using manual repositioning (Leica stage steered by a joystick)</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stretching, acquire a new confocal image followed by a STED image for the same sub region. </p><p><u>&nbsp;</u></p><p><strong>Super-resolution microscopy in fixed cells with large stretches</strong></p><p>The following steps are required to perform large and sustained stretching followed by rapid cell fixation. </p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm 4% PFA with 0.25% Glutaraldehyde at 37°C. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mounting the micromechanical device on the microscope, acquire several low resolution images of GFP markers for different cells. </p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the entire module (device and motor in the stage-adapted holder) and stretch the cells outside the microscope. Immediately after stretching, remove the Ringer solution and fix the cells in warm 4% PFA with 0.25% Glutaraldehyde. </p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fixation, rinse 3-4X with PBS. </p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clamp the stretching arm to the holding arm using the thread and groove system and two M3 screws. Afterwards, remove the screw that connects the stretching arm to the motor. With this, stretching is sustained throughout all the subsequent labelling steps and super-resolution imaging. </p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Label target proteins according to the imaging technique. </p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After labelling, and before performing super-resolution imaging, acquire again several low resolution images of GFP markers for the same cells.&nbsp;</p><p><u>DNA- PAINT on fixed cells with large stretches</u></p><p>Cells are imaged at 25°C in Buffer C<sup> </sup>in the same microscope used for live sptPALM. Cy3B-labelled strands were visualized with a 561 nm laser (Cobolt Jive). Fluorescence was collected by the combination of a dichroic and emission filters (dichroic: Di01-R561, emission: FF01-617/73, Semrock) and a sensitive sCMOS (scientific CMOS, ORCA-Flash4.0, Hammatasu). The acquisition was steered by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices) in streaming mode at 6.7 Hz. Vimentin-GFP was imaged using a conventional GFP filter cube (excitation: FF01-472/30, dichroic: FF-495Di02, emission: FF02-520/28, Semrock). Super-resolution DNA-PAINT reconstruction and drift correction were carried out as described before, using the software package Picasso <sup>24</sup>.</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilute the desired imager strand in Buffer C.

Vimentin-Halo was visualized with Cy3B-labelled DNA imager strands, added to the stretching chamber at variable concentrations (2-5 nM), as previously described <sup>24</sup>.</p><p><u>STED on fixed cells with large stretches</u></p><p>Cells are imaged at 25°C in PBS 1X in the same microscope used for live STED, with the same combination of a WLL2 laser and a 775 nm depletion laser. </p><p><br></p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p><strong>Autofluorescence of the medium inside the micromechanical device</strong></p><p>This is likely caused by the 3D-printed micro-device itself. Since resins used for SLA are photoactivable at UV light, they can also be excited by the 405 nm laser used for sptPALM. Detachment of particles from the 3D-printed micro-device will therefore be visible and might interfere with the mEos /tdEos signal. There is no clear information about fluorescence of different SLA resins so, if autofluorescence persists, two possibilities exist. First, the entire holding arm can be covered with Dow Corning™ High-Vacuum Grease, which prevents release of autofluorescent particles. Alternatively, other resins can be tested, such as Black (Formlabs). </p><p><strong>PDMS is not stretched</strong></p><p>Case 1: During PDMS elastic substrate production, air bubbles formed when Gel-Pak frame was brought in contact with 10 µm PDMS layer on the silicon wafer. Usually this will generate irregularities in the substrate which, if close to the 3x3 mm observation chamber, will affect the stretching. </p><p>Case 2: Glycerol coating was incomplete and thus PDMS adhered to the glass. </p><p>Case 3: Plasma cleaning of PDMS elastic substrate was not effective (either too long or too short) and thus PDMS is not gliding on glycerol. </p><p>Case 4: Stretching arm was not properly attached to the glass-PDMS assembly </p><p><strong>Sustained stretching causes the micromechanical device to rupture or leak</strong></p><p>The groove and thread system is still rather preliminary and requires further optimization, since it causes pressure on the micro-device, leading to leakage of liquid from inside of the device. Different designing strategies can be developed to sustain stretching, such as two 3D-printed clamps from the side and an adjustable screw in the middle, or simply a 3D-printed rod that blocks the recoil of the arm. </p><p><br></p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>Before experiment:</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printing one 3D micro-device (holding and stretching arm) : 4 hours </p><p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Note: </strong>Since 3D micro-devices can be re-used several times, it is more efficient to dedicate a full week to 3D printing in order to have a substantial amount of devices for all experiments. </p><p>For experiments: </p><p><u>Day 1</u></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing the PDMS elastic substrate: 2 hours for 20 substrates</p><p><u>Day 2 and 3 </u></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cell preparation: 1 or 2 days</p><p><u>Day 3</u></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembling the glass-PDMS ‘sandwich’: 3 hours for 20 substrates</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembling the complete micromechanical device: 1 day</p><p><u>Day 4</u></p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coating the micromechanical device and cell seeding: 3 hours</p><p><br></p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabricating a 10 µm PDMS elastic substrate</strong></p><p>Make sure GelPak frame is placed without air bubbles and that PDMS should be detached carefully after curing overnight. If the elastic substrate is properly made, no air bubbles or irregularities should be visible, especially around the observation chamber.</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembling the micromechanical device</strong></p><p>Successful PDMS gliding on glycerol layer can be observed later in the microscope during stretching, by calculating the actual displacement after a test stretching. The device will be properly fully assembled if no medium is leaking from the chamber and the arm remains well attached throughout all subsequent steps. </p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cell preparation</strong></p><p>If the device is well coated and cells are viable after electroporation, detachment and seeding, they should start to spread briefly after seeding. 1h later, spread cells should be visible in the observation chamber of 3x3 µm. </p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing the stretching device for live stretching or large stretches followed by rapid fixation</strong></p><p>Bead incubation can be quickly confirmed using GFP filter cube. Successful stretching and viability of the device can be confirmed by performing a test stretch and assessing that the same two beads are more distant between each other after stretching. If the device is assembled correctly, stretches closer to the holding arm will produce smaller displacements. </p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live cell stretching combined with super-resolution microscopy and single protein tracking</strong></p><p>Successful combination of live sptPALM or STED with stretching is achieved if 1) focus is maintained throughout stretching, 2) Live XYZ repositioning is possible throughout stretching and 3) quality of either the single-molecule signal or the STED effect is assured throughout the entire acquisition. </p><p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super-resolution microscopy in fixed cells with large stretches</strong></p><p>Sustaining the stretching after fixation can be verified immediately after fixation by assessing morphology of the 3x3 chamber on a bench top microscope. If the chamber remains deformed, stretching is maintained. This can also be confirmed when imaging the sample after labelling, by re-measuring the distance between the same two beads used to test the stretching before fixation. For DNA-PAINT acquisitions to be successful, drift correction is a key aspect and has to be ensured. </p><p><br></p><h2>References</h2><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goldyn, A.
