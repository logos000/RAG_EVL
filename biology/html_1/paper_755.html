Knowledge detailing human pre-gastrulation embryonic development including spatial self-organization and cell type ontogeny remains limited by available two-dimensional technological platforms. Here, we present a three-dimensional (3D) blastocyst-culture system, which enables human blastocyst development through primitive streak anlage (PSA). By the 3D-platform combined with immunofluorescence imaging and single-cell RNA-Seq, we reveal a developmental landscape of human pre-gastrulation embryos. Our protocol allows recording and analysis of embryo developmental landmarks and mechanisms from human blastocysts to pre-gastrulation stage (day 14 post- fertilization).</p><br>Keywords: Human pre-gastrulation embryo, three-dimensional (3D) culture, primitive streak anlage, immunofluorescence imaging, single cell RNA-seq<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>	Early human embryogenesis, such as architecture formation and cell type specification, is obscure owing to technical challenge and unavailable materials. Recent<em> in vitro</em> implantation platforms using a two-dimensional (2D) culture approach have revealed some developmental landmarks<em> </em>of <em>in vivo</em> early human embryos<a href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a>. However, these 2D-culture embryos are largely flattened, which creates an imperfect model of normal three-dimensional (3D) embryonic development <em>in vivo</em> and limits classification using equivalent Carnegie stages<a href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup>3-5</sup></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Culture maintenance medium:</strong></p><p>Advanced DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fischer Scientific,12634-010)</p><p>DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum) (Biosera, bs-0003)</p><p>L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 25030)</p><p>ITS-X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 51500-056)</p><p>β-Estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich, E8875)</p><p>Progesterone (Sigma-Aldrich, P0130)</p><p>N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich, A7250)</p><p>Sodium Lactate (Sigma-Aldrich, L7900)</p><p>Sodium Pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, P4562)</p><p>Y27632 (Selleck, S1049)</p><p>Matrigel (Corning, 354234)</p><p><strong>Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removing medium:</strong></p><p>Kitazato Thawing Media Kit (Kitazato Corporation, VT102)</p><p>G-2 (Vitrolife, 10029)</p><p>Mineral oil (Vitrolife, 10029)</p><p>Tyrode’s solution (Sigma-Aldrich, T1788)</p><p><strong>Fixation and Immunostaining:</strong></p><p>Paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, 158127)</p><p>Triton X-100 (MP Biomedicals, 0219485483)</p><p>Tween-20 (Life Science Products &amp; Services, TB0560)</p><p>BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A8022)</p><p>PBS (Solarbio, P1010)</p><p><strong>Single Cell Isolation:</strong></p><p>0.5% Trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15400054)</p><p>G-MOPS (Vitrolife, 10130)</p><p>PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14190114)</p><p>DFBS (defined fetal bovine serum) (Biosera, bs-0003)</p><p>SuperScript II (Invitrogen, 18064-014) </p><p>KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems, KK2601)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>CO<sub>2</sub> cell culture incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 3111)</p><p>Confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica, SP8)</p><p>Multi-photon microscope (Leica, TCS SP8 DIVE)</p><p>Inverted microscope (Leica, IV/2010)</p><p>Biosafety cabinet (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1389)</p><p>Stereo microscope (Nikon, SMZ645)</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p>All donated embryos in this study were surplus frozen embryos from couples who already had at least a healthy baby after IVF clinic treatment. The informed consent process for embryo donation compiled with International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation (2016) and Ethical Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell research (2003) jointly issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health of People’s Republic of China.</p><p><strong>Embryo thawing and zona pellucida removal</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before embryo thawing, human embryo culture medium G-2 was equilibrated in a</p><p>4-well plate overnight. 0.5 ml of G-2 medium was added to the well, and then 0.25 ml of mineral oil was used to cover the G2 medium.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The G-2 medium must be pre-equilibrated in the incubator overnight or for at least 6 hours.</p><p>2. Human blastocysts (day 5 or 6 post-fertilization, d.p.f 5-6) were thawed using a Kitazato Thawing Media Kit by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>3. After culturing in drops of equilibrated G-2 medium for 4 hours, the embryos were transferred to acidic Tyrode’s solution to remove the zona pellucida.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Pasteur's pipette diameter should be larger than the embryo diameter to avoid damaging the embryos. No more than two embryos were treated in the acidic Tyrode’s solution each time. Once the zona pellucida vanished, the embryos were immediately transferred to G-2 medium to avoid damage to the embryos by the acidic Tyrode’s solution.</p><p>4. Embryos were washed in G-2 medium for two times and then transferred to <em>in vitro </em>culture medium.</p><p><strong>Evaluation of embryo quality </strong></p><p>According to the Gardner’s scoring system<sup>6</sup>, thawed blastocysts were given numerical scores from 1 to 6 based on their expansion degree and hatching status. The blastocyst with expansion and hatching status above 3 and with visible inner cell mass above grade B were included in the study. Based on morphologies, normal embryos had to meet the two following requirements: obvious expansion during culturing and absence of obviously dead or broken (fragmented) cell mass during development. Otherwise, they were excluded in this study.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>In vitro</em> three-dimensional culture of human embryos</strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture conditions were

Embryos were washed in 0.25% trypsin drops for 2 times and then transferred to the third drop of trypsin</p><p>5. Embryos were incubated in a 7℃ incubator for 15 mins</p><p>6. 2 µL DFBS was added to the third drop to terminate the digestion</p><p>7. Each embryo was transferred to a drop of G-MOPS in 35mm petri dish covered by mineral oil in room temperature</p><p>8. Use different diameters of Pasture pipette to blow the embryo into single cell</p><p>9. Each single cell was washed in DPBS</p><p>10. Each single cell was pipetted into a PCR tube with 2 µL lysis solution</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p><strong>Zona pellucida remove of embryos: </strong>When the embryo develops <em>in vivo</em>, it hatches itself from the zona pellucida. We need to remove the zona pellucida to ensure the embryo's continued development. The digestion process of Tyrode’s solution is very violent, excessive digestion will affect the quality of embryos. The thickness of zona pellucida was various of different embryos, so that embryos should be digested at a maximum number of two in the same time.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The diameter of Pasteur pipette should be larger than the embryo, or the embryo would be damaged.</p><p>During digestion, the embryos must be observed all the times to ensure that the digestion time is just right.</p><p>Before embryos transferred to mIVC1, make sure the residue of Tyrode’s solution was washed out.</p><p><strong>Optimizing the&nbsp;components of culture medium: </strong>To optimize the culture medium, we add<strong> </strong>sodium lactate and sodium pyruvate to supplement the energy required for embryo metabolism, add Y27632 to delay apoptosis. We removed penicillin/streptomycin and performed strict aseptic operations.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> strictly aseptic operations should be performed.</p><p><strong>Establish of 3D culture system:</strong> In the process of repeating 2D culture system, we found that at d.p.f 11 the trophoblast became apoptosis and the diameter of the embryos cannot be enlarged. In order to simulate the development process of embryos<em> in vivo</em>, we attempted to add a substance during the embryo implantation stage so that the embryo can grow in three dimensions. Therefore, we used low-attachment plate during&nbsp;pre-implantation stage then added Matrigel at the implantation stage until d.p.f 14.</p><p><strong>Confirm the concentration of Matrigel: </strong>To preserve the three-dimensional structure of the embryo, we tried four experimental conditions of Matrigel and finally we confirmed that 10% Matrigel was the best condition.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>All the operations of Matrigle should be carried on the ice.</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>3D culture of embryos from blastocyst: 9 days</p><p>IF staining of frozen sections: 2 days</p><p>IF staining of whole embryos: 2 days</p><h2>References</h2><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shahbazi, M.
