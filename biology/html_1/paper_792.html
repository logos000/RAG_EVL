discard.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 50mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to the remaining volume of MEM.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 5mL of 100X penicillin/streptomycin to the medium.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix thoroughly and label with the date and additives.</p><p><strong><u>Collagen Coating of Tissue Culture Plates </u></strong></p><p>16HBE cells should be grown on dishes/plates/inserts that have been coated with 50 mg/mL bovine collagen I solution according to the separate method “Collagen Coating for Tissue Culture”.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Thawing Cryopreserved Cells</u></strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm media and prepare materials prior to obtaining a vial of cells from cryostorage.</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reduces the amount of time cells are thawed in the presence of DMSO.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove vial from liquid nitrogen (wearing eye protection) and thaw in 37°C water bath (1-2 min).</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that cells are thawed quickly to prevent damage and reduced viability.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 24 mL of growth medium to a 50 mL conical tube then add the thawed cells and gently mix by inversion.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pellet cells via centrifugation at 1,000 x <em>g</em> for 3 minutes at room temperature.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully aspirate the supernatant.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently resuspend the cells in 10mL of pre-warmed growth medium and transfer into a 10 cm collagen coated tissue culture dish (see separate method “Collagen Coating for Tissue Culture”).</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incubate in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> overnight.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check cells the following day for attachment to the dish.&nbsp;Replace medium to remove dead cells (rounded, unattached cells).&nbsp;Culture at least three passages before using in experiments.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Sub-culturing cells</u></strong></p><p>Cells should be split three days after being plated at 2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-warm growth medium and PBS in a 37 °C water bath and a trypsin aliquot at room temperature (~30 minutes).</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the cull culture medium.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rinse cells in 10 cm plates with 10 mL pre-warmed PBS (use 20 mL for 15 cm plates), swirling gently.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspirate the PBS wash.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 750 μL trypsin (for 10 cm plate, 1.5mL of 15 cm plate) and spread evenly across the cell surface</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place in 37 °C incubator for 4 minutes.&nbsp;Following incubation, use the palm of your hand to hit the side of dish to facilitate detachment.&nbsp;If cells are still attached, incubate for another 2 minutes.&nbsp;Incubate and tap dish until &gt;95% of the cells are detached.&nbsp;Check detachment with microscope.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 12 mL medium and gently wash the surface of the dish with a pipette and triturate once to break up any large cell clumps.&nbsp;Transfer to a 50 mL centrifuge tube.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash the plate with an additional 12 mL of medium, collect, triturate, and add to the cell suspension in step #7.</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centrifuge at 1,000 x <em>g</em> for 4 minutes to pellet cells.</p><p>10.&nbsp;Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 12 mL of medium.&nbsp;Add additional growth medium to dilute the cell suspension if desired.&nbsp;Typically, medium is added such that there is a total volume of 12 mL per 1-2 15 cm plates collected.</p><p>11.&nbsp;Prepare a 1:5 dilution in PBS (800 μL PBS + 200 μL cell suspension) in an Eppendorf tube.</p><p>12.&nbsp;Count cells on a hemocytometer (do not use an automated cell counter as these cells tend to form small clumps that are not accurately quantified by automated methods).</p><p>13.&nbsp;Dilute cells to 2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL in growth medium in a 50 mL tube or larger sterile bottle to the total volume that will be used for plating (10 mL for each 10 cm plate and 25 mL for each 15 cm plate).</p><p>14.&nbsp;Mix thoroughly by swirling and dispense the diluted cell suspension into collagen coated tissue culture dishes (see separate method “Collagen Coating for Tissue Culture”).</p><p>15.&nbsp;Incubate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.&nbsp;Cells will be ready to split three days after plating.</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>NOTE:</strong> plating cells at a determined cell density will result in more predictable sub-culture and more reproducible performance in subsequent experimental assays.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Preparing cells for cryopreservation</u></strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare freezing medium.</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50% FBS, 40% growth medium, 10% DMSO.</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter through a 0.2 μm syringe filter.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow sub-culturing protocol through step #7. </p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determine the number of cells present and pellet cells by centrifugation at 1,000 x <em>g</em> for 3 minutes at room temperature.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuspend the cell pellet at a density of 3.0 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in freezing medium.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aliquot into cryovials (1 mL per vial).</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put vials in a controlled cell freezing container (filled to indicated line with isopropyl alcohol) and place in a -80 °C freezer overnight.&nbsp;</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chamber regulates cooling to about 1 °C per minute.</p><p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: isopropanol should be changed after every three freezing cycles.</p><p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: do not leave vials at -80 °C longer than overnight as it will impact viability after thawing.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the frozen vials in liquid nitrogen storage.</p><h2>References</h2><p>Original description of cells: </p><p>Cozens AL, <em>et al.</em> (1994) CFTR
