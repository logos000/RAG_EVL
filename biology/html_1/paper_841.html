Further improvement of the editing range and efficiency is critical for their broader applications. In this protocol, we demonstrated that fusion of the single-strand DNA binding domain (ssDBD) from Rad51 protein between Cas9n and cytidine deaminases, serial hyper CBEs (hyCBEs) were generated with substantially increased activity and an expanded editing window toward the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in cell lines<strong>.</strong> Moreover, hyeA3A-BE4max specifically generated a C-to-T conversion without inducing bystander mutations in the hemoglobin gamma (HBG) gene promoter to mimic a naturally occurring genetic variant for amelioration of β-hemoglobinopathy, suggesting the therapeutic potential of the improved base editors. This step-by-step protocol is related to the publication “Increasing the efficiency and targeting range of cytidine base editors through fusion of a single-strand DNA binding protein domain” in Nature Cell Biology.</p><br>Keywords: CRISPR-Cas9, Base editing, CBEs, Gene therapy<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Through fusion of cytidine deaminases, such as rAPOBEC1<sup>1</sup>, hAID<sup>2</sup>, hAPOBEC3A<sup>3-5</sup> or PmCDA1<sup>6-8</sup> at the N or C terminus of Cas9n (Cas9 D10A), CBEs were developed to efficiently generate C-to-T transitions. Their efficiency was further enhanced by the presence of a uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) domain either through direct fusion to the C terminus or separately delivered with CBEs<sup>7,9</sup>. The editing window of CBEs (such as BE3, BE4 or BE4max) is typically located 4-8 nucleotides downstream from the 5′ end of the targeted sequence distal to the PAM site<sup>1,7,10</sup>. Base editors could only edit the nucleotides within this window which is determined by the intrinsic feature of distinct deaminases. Great efforts have been made to either reduce or increase the editing window to generate versatile base editors for various purposes. Three BE3s have been developed with the editing window within three nucleotides, but their activity is either comparable or reduced compared with BE3<sup>11</sup>. Through structure-based design and modifications of hAPOBEC3A, eA3A-BE3 has been shown to selectively generate C-to-T conversions within the TC motifs but not in a non-cognate bystander motif<sup>4</sup>. </p><p>On the contrary, base editors with increased targeting range are also valuable to generate more genotypes for saturation mutagenesis, disrupt gene function or correct genetic mutations for gene therapy. These innovative modifications had no significant impact on the editing efficiency which is critical for CBE applications, especially for therapeutic purposes. Several studies have shown to enhance C-to-T base editing activity through codon optimization, nuclear localization signal (NLS) modification<sup>10</sup> or molecular evolution through phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) of distinct cytidine deaminases<sup>12</sup>, but these enhanced CBEs are inefficient at catalyzing cytidines adjacent to the PAM site.</p><p>Since cytidine deaminases mainly catalyze C-to-T conversion on the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrate generated by Cas9 D10A nickase, we hypothesized that fusion of a non-sequence specific ssDBD might increase the binding affinity and editing activity.Through the screen of ten ssDBDs, serial hyper CBEs (hyCBEs) were generated through fusion of ssDBD from Rad51 to BE4max, A3A-BE4max and eA3A-BE4max. HyCBEs exhibited higher activity and broader editing window than the original CBEs, and hyeA3A-BE4max exhibited a high preference for TC motifs with a broader targeting range. As an example, hyeA3A-BE4max could specifically generate C-to-T conversion at the -117 site in hemoglobin gamma (HBG) promoter to reactivate the γ-globin gene expression in HUDEP-2 cells,suggesting the potential of hyeA3A-BE4max in gene therapy. This protocol below contains the construction of the hyCBEs and the application of hyeA3A-BE4max in HUDEP-2 cells.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>General reagents:</strong></p><p>KOD–Plus-Neo DNA Polymerase (TOYOBO, cat. no.

Followed by high-throughput deep sequencing to obtain precise editing efficiency with site-specific primers 117G-Hitom-F/R containing an adaptor sequence (Forward 5′-ggagtgagtacggtgtgc-3′; Backward 5′-gagttggatgctggatgg-3′) at the 5′ end. The above products are then subjected to a second-round PCR . The resulting libraries are mixed and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform.</p><p>The primers described above are as follows :</p><p>HBG-Δ<sup>G</sup>γ-117G-F(Merlin) :AGTGTGTGGACTATTAGTCAA</p><p>HBG-Δ<sup>G</sup>γ-117G-R(Merlin) :catggcgtctggactaggag</p><p>117G-Hitom-F :ggagtgagtacggtgtgctggaatgactgaatcggaacaaggc</p><p>117G-Hitom-R :gagttggatgctggatggctggcctcactggatactctaagact</p><p><strong>E: Statistics analysis </strong></p><p>The C&gt;T, A, G conversions and indels in the HTS data are analyzed using BE-Analyzer <sup>15</sup> or CRISPResso2<sup>16</sup>.

Means of two groups are compared using Student’s t-test (unpaired, 2-tailed), with P &lt; 0.05 considered to be statistically significant.</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>When measuring the titer, if no fluorescence is observed in the cells, it is related to the state of the cell. The virus titer is too low.
