Here we present our protocol for an engineered stromal-free niche developed using complementary single cell transcriptomic analyses of HE/HSC and the AGM-EC niche to define ligand-receptor interactions sufficient to support HSC formation from embryonic hemogenic precursors in vitro. This protocol will be useful to identify and characterize additional niche-derived signaling ligands/pathways that may further enhance HSC generation from HE in vitro in a well-defined platform, and provides a basis for further translational efforts toward HSC production in vitro such as from embryonic or pluripotent stem cells.</p><br>Keywords: engineered niche, aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM), hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), hemogenic precursors, hematopoietic niche, anti-Notch1 antibody, anti-Notch2 antibody, fibronectin, VCAM1-Fc, Delta1(Dll1)-Fc, CXCL12 <br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are multilineage, self-renewing cells with the ability to engraft long-term when transplanted to an adult host. The first HSCs emerge during embryonic development from specialized hemogenic endothelial cells within the major arterial vasculature—including the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. HSCs have significant therapeutic potential for use in cellular therapies and disease modeling. However, efforts to reliably and reproducibly generate HSCs in a stroma-free niche, and to specify HSCs from induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells, have achieved only limited success. To facilitate these efforts, a thorough understanding of the signals that are necessary and sufficient to support HSC emergence and development is essential. Previous studies generated an engineered platform to support Notch signaling in hematopoietic progenitors derived from human cord blood HSCs as well as murine bone marrow-derived HSCs<sup>1,2</sup>.&nbsp;These stroma-free methods used in-house engineered, immobilized Notch ligand (Delta1/Dll1) to support Notch signaling (and, in some cases, in conjunction with immobilized fibronectin fragment and appropriate cytokines to support expansion of short-term engrafting progenitors for therapeutic applications<sup>3</sup>). We previously identified conditions incorporating the use of immobilized Dll1 sufficient to support quantitative expansion of AGM HSCs derived from embryonic day 11 (E11), when directly engrafting HSC are first reproducibly detected in the AGM at low frequency. However, this niche was insufficient to support the maturation of hemogenic precursors isolated prior to E11 to engrafting HSCs<sup>4</sup> and was dependent on FBS-containing media which introduces unknown variability due to FBS components and batch variation, as well as artificial Dll1 ligand generated in-house<sup>5</sup>. Building on these prior methods, and leveraging complementary single cell transcriptomics to identify ligand-receptor interactions in the&nbsp;HSC-supportive AGM-EC niche, our lab has developed methodology for the maturation of AGM-derived hemogenic precursors to engrafting HSCs through culture in an engineered niche, using a stroma-free and serum-free platform incorporating Notch receptor-specific activating antibodies (in place of Dll1 ligand) and other commercially-available components. Herein, we provide details on how to replicate these results.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><u>Reagents for engineered culture plate preparation:</u></p><p>48-well non-tissue culture-treated plates (Corning/Falcon, cat no. 351178)</p><p>Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)(Gibco, cat. no. 14190-144)</p><p><sup>5</sup>anti-Notch1 antibody (clone HMN1-12)(Biolegend, cat no. 95499)</p><p>anti-Notch2 antibody (clone HMN2-35)(Biolegend, cat no. 96014) *Not currently available from Biolegend as a purified nonconjugated antibody.

Harvest embryos from pregnant females at 9.5 to 11.5 days post coitum (dpc), depending on the stage desired.  &nbsp;</p><p>3. Dissect the AGM&nbsp;(or for E9.5 embryos, the central portion of the embryo proper containing the para-aortic splanchnopleure/P-Sp)&nbsp;from the embryos&nbsp;on ice-cold PBS with 10% FBS,&nbsp;as previously described7, pooling embryos from&nbsp;litters at the equivalent developmental stage based on somite numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Collect the&nbsp;pooled&nbsp;P-Sp/AGM&nbsp;tissues in a 15ml conical tube containing 10 ml PBS with 10% FBS on ice. Gravity settle tissues and gently remove PBS/10%&nbsp;FBS. Add 1ml 0.25% collagenase. Place in a 37°C water bath for 25 min. &nbsp;</p><p>5. Add 1 ml of PBS/10% FBS. Pipette about 20-30 times with a 1 ml pipette tip to obtain a single cell suspension. Add an additional 8 ml of PBS/10% FBS and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant. &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp;</p><p><u>Sorting of VE-Cad+EPCR+CD61+ precursors  &nbsp;</u></p><p>1. Prepare the blocking buffer for antibody staining. Add 10&nbsp;micrograms/ml&nbsp;anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fc receptor (FcR) block) and 1&nbsp;microgram/mL DAPI (1 mg/ml&nbsp;stock in H2O) to 1&nbsp;ml&nbsp;PBS with 10% FBS. &nbsp;</p><p>2. Draw up in a 3&nbsp;ml&nbsp;syringe and pass through a 0.22-micron&nbsp;syringe filter to sterilize. Re-suspend the cell pellet from the dissociated murine embryonic tissues in 500&nbsp;microliters&nbsp;blocking buffer and incubate on ice for 5 min. &nbsp;</p><p>3. Prepare the antibody mix: Add 10&nbsp;microgram/ml FcR block to 1&nbsp;ml&nbsp;PBS with 10% FBS and 10&nbsp;microliters&nbsp;of each fluorochrome-conjugated antibody (see reagent list): VEcadherin-PECy7, EPCR-PerCP-eFluor710, and CD61-APC. Also prepare a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;antibody mix&nbsp;containing&nbsp;isotype controls&nbsp;antibodies&nbsp;(see reagent list)&nbsp;that will&nbsp;be used&nbsp;to stain&nbsp;a small fraction of AGM cells&nbsp;(~10%)&nbsp;for&nbsp;setting&nbsp;sorting&nbsp;gates.&nbsp;(Note: use a 1:100&nbsp;final&nbsp;dilution of antibodies unless otherwise indicated based on the manufacturer’s recommendations&nbsp;or according to titrations).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>4. Draw antibody mix into a 3 ml syringe and pass through a 0.22-micron&nbsp;syringe filter to sterilize. Add 0.5&nbsp;ml&nbsp;antibody mix to cell pellet in blocking buffer from above. Incubate on ice for at least 20&nbsp;minutes. &nbsp;</p><p>5.

Remove cell clumps by pipetting the cell suspension through a 35-micron&nbsp;cell strainer cap on a 5 ml tube. Place on ice until FACS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>7. Perform fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) by first gating&nbsp;on&nbsp;SSC and FSC&nbsp;(using&nbsp;relatively broad gates&nbsp;for FSC-A, as embryonic hemogenic precursors tend to vary in&nbsp;size,&nbsp;and&nbsp;using&nbsp;FSC-W and SSC-W&nbsp;gates&nbsp;to exclude doublets; for sample gating,&nbsp;see6)&nbsp;and&nbsp;gating on&nbsp;live cells&nbsp;as&nbsp;DAPI&nbsp;negative. Gate on VE-Cadherin positive&nbsp;cells and then gate on&nbsp;the subset that is positive for both&nbsp;EPCR&nbsp;and&nbsp;CD61.&nbsp;Use isotype control and&nbsp;fluor-minus one (FMO)&nbsp;samples to set thresholds for gates.&nbsp;Set the sorting machine to the lowest flow rate of 1.0&nbsp;to minimize shear stress. Sort cells into a&nbsp;5ml&nbsp;tube containing&nbsp;cold&nbsp;PBS/10% FBS. &nbsp;</p><p>8. After sorting, centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 10 min, aspirate, and re-suspend the cell pellet&nbsp;in&nbsp;serum-free media (enough for 100&nbsp;microliters/48-well). Re-suspend approximately 1-2 embryo equivalent of&nbsp;sorted&nbsp;cells per 48-well (this may need to be adjusted based on the embryonic stage).&nbsp;</p><p>9. Add 100&nbsp;microliters&nbsp;of cells to each 48-well (from plate prepared for engineered niche culture), for a total volume of&nbsp;500&nbsp;microliters/well&nbsp;(or for other well formats, total volume indicated in Supplementary Table 2). &nbsp;</p><p>10. Culture cells for 6-7 days&nbsp;in a 37°C&nbsp;tissue culture incubator with 5% C02&nbsp;before harvesting for phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry and transplantation assays.&nbsp;During culture, colonies of&nbsp;highly&nbsp;motile, semi-adherent, dividing&nbsp;hematopoietic progeny should emerge&nbsp;(see Figure&nbsp;1 and Supplementary movie), but&nbsp;cells&nbsp;should not be confluent at the time of harvest. To harvest cells, pipette vigorously&nbsp;and scrape&nbsp;wells&nbsp;with pipette tip&nbsp;to remove all cells.&nbsp;Remove&nbsp;10% of cells&nbsp;for phenotyping,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;remaining 90%&nbsp;for transplantation&nbsp;or other secondary assays (such as CFU or lymphoid assays in secondary OP9 and OP9-Delta&nbsp;co-cultures8).&nbsp;General phenotyping and&nbsp;transplantation&nbsp;assays are described in our previously published protocol.6&nbsp;To ensure that all cells are harvested,&nbsp;a small volume of&nbsp;PBS/2% FBS&nbsp;can be used&nbsp;in an additional round of vigorous pipetting and added to the&nbsp;rest of the harvested cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>Hematopoietic colonies do not form&nbsp;and/or have reduced growth and/or have an uneven&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;in culture from sorted AGM cells:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>1. The process of sorting could potentially harm AGM cells. Make sure to set the flow sorter to the lowest flow rate of 1.0 or adjust nozzle size to minimize shear stress on AGM cells.&nbsp;</p><p>2. If care is not taken while washing plate to aspirate ligand solution and wash with PBS one well at a time, adherent antibodies and immobilized ligands may dry out, impairing their ability to interact with AGM cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;During&nbsp;6-7 days of&nbsp;culture&nbsp;in&nbsp;37°C incubator, the&nbsp;media may&nbsp;start to evaporate&nbsp;which may affect cell growth and viability.&nbsp;Using an incubator with adequate&nbsp;humidity, and&nbsp;adding&nbsp;sterile water or&nbsp;PBS to the&nbsp;empty&nbsp;wells surrounding&nbsp;the wells&nbsp;containing&nbsp;cells&nbsp;at the beginning of culture&nbsp;should help prevent evaporation&nbsp;from occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>4. Media is yellow by end of culture period&nbsp;or cells are overgrown in culture (confluent or forming colonies of cells growing on top&nbsp;of one another): initial cell density for plating&nbsp;was too high.&nbsp;Reduce the numbers of cells plated at day 0.&nbsp;We generally aim for&nbsp;1-2 embryo equivalent of cells per 48-well, but this may need to be adjusted based on the embryonic stage.&nbsp;</p><p>5.&nbsp;Coating wells with&nbsp;an&nbsp;inadequate&nbsp;amount of&nbsp;ligand solution&nbsp;will cause uneven distribution of ligand coating&nbsp;on&nbsp;the plastic&nbsp;bottom.&nbsp;Cells will&nbsp;then&nbsp;distribute&nbsp;unevenly sometimes&nbsp;with&nbsp;a donut shape&nbsp;on the well bottom.&nbsp;Increase amount of ligand solution used to initially coat the plastic.&nbsp;</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>8-10 days for setting up timed&nbsp;matings&nbsp;and embryo development prior to dissection and sort&nbsp;</p><p>6-7 days of culture to expand sorted hemogenic precursor colonies&nbsp;</p><p>Total estimated time of procedure: 14-17 days&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>During culture in the engineered niche, colonies of highly&nbsp;motile, semi-adherent hematopoietic&nbsp;cells&nbsp;should emerge (see Figure 1 and Supplementary movie), containing a mixture of&nbsp;HSCs and their progeny&nbsp;by phenotype and based on transplantation assays following culture.
