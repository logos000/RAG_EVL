Methodological capabilities, however, have been limited to few laboratories due to difficulties reproducibly visualizing these rare cell subsets in the meninges. To explore meningeal lymphatics fundamental role during homeostasis and how they may contribute to human pathology, the field has begun to require purification and characterization of lymphatic endothelial cells. Here, modern cell biological techniques involving a combination of histological, flow-cytometric, and functional drainage assays are applied to brain and spinal cord meninges and detailed stepwise procedures used for successful in vivo and ex vivo characterization of meningeal lymphatic vessels.</p><br>Keywords: Brain meninges, Spinal cord meninges, Neuroimmunology, CSF drainage <br><h2>Introduction</h2><p><strong><span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span></strong>The meningeal microenvironment is composed of many cell types, including innate and adaptive immune cells. Lymphatic vessels within the meninges have been shown to support the drainage of macromolecules and solutes [<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR1" target="_blank">1</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR2" target="_blank">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR3" target="_blank">3</a>]. Studying their functions that may govern inflammatory processes and immune surveillance of the meninges and CNS poses a valuable contribution to our understanding of neurological disease, and even resistance to therapies of the CNS [<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR4" target="_blank">4</a>]. Recent studies from our laboratory indicated that the meningeal environment is changed following performance of cognitive tasks [<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR5" target="_blank">5</a>]. T cells are recruited to the meningeal spaces, supporting neuronal function through production of IL-4 and regulating meningeal myeloid cell phenotypes and subsequent brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Thus, investigating the migration in and out of the meninges of different cell types through lymphatic vessels is critical for further understanding the crosstalk between immune system and nervous system. The use of single cell analysis such as flow cytometry or RNA-seq allows phenotypic and even functional characterization of the lymphatic cells, aiming at deciphering their role in guiding immune sentinels. Such fundamental features as morphology, surface phenotype, and function are unreported in neurological diseases. Here we provide simple methods to extract and analyze lymphatic endothelial cells from the meninges to effectively identify their contribution to physiological processes in health and disease. These techniques could also be used to address this and many other outstanding questions pertaining human meningeal lymphatics biology.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Animal Preparation</strong></p><p>1.

Anesthetize mouse by injection of a suitable dosage of anesthesia [<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#CR6" target="_blank">6</a>] in accordance with the regulations of your institution’s animal care and use committee.</p><p>2. Make an incision through the abdominal wall of the chest, cut both sides of the rib cage to expose the heart and clip the right auricle with a small scissor.</p><p>3. Perfuse the mouse through the left ventricle with ~15 ml of ice-cold PBS with 5&nbsp;U/ml heparin at a rate of ~10 ml per minute until the liver is clear of blood.</p><p>4. Replace the PBS-containing syringe with the PFA-containing syringe and perfuse manually with ~15 ml of 4% PFA at a rate of ~10&nbsp;ml/min (<em>Note: </em>Twitching and stiffing of the muscles indicate successful perfusion of the fixative.).</p><p>5. Remove the skin from the back and head of the dorsal site of the mouse with a pair of blunt scissors.</p><p>6. Decapitate mouse close to the skull, approximately at C1 level. Make a transverse cut through the L5 vertebrae, just above the hips.</p><p>7. Continue with a longitudinal incision from the anterior end, down the right side of the spinal cord until reaching the cervical region. Repeat longitudinal cut along the left side of the spinal cord. Lift the column and separate it from muscles, organs and connective tissue underneath.</p><p>8. Keep the skull and spinal cord in 4% PFA at 4&nbsp;°C for 24&nbsp;h (<em>Note: </em>Over fixation for 2–3&nbsp;days may cause some antigens to be masked and not be recognized by specific antibodies. The tissue should be stored in PBS supplemented with 0.01% sodium azide or 0.02% thimerosal&nbsp;at 4&nbsp;°C for up to a year. If fluorescent proteins are used, tissue should be protected from light to avoid photobleaching.).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spinal Cord Meninges Whole-Mount Preparation</strong></p><p>1. Fill a petri dish with PBS and place the spinal cord with the ventral site up. Take angled spring scissors and clip the neural arch bilaterally one to two segments at a time. Then lift the end of the lose bone and cut across the neural spine to remove the bone and expose the ventral surface of the spinal cord. Continue this process with the next vertebrae until the whole ventral surface of the spinal cord is exposed.</p><p>2. To widen the spinal column for dissection, hold the edges of the spinal column on either side with two straight forceps and crack open carefully.</p><p>3. Remove spinal cord and adherent meninges in one piece and place in petri dish with fresh PBS (<em>Note: </em>Optional: dorsal root ganglions can be carefully pulled out of bone segments before the spinal cord is resected.).</p><p>4. Use spring microscissors to make a midline incision of the meninges along the ventral surface of the spinal cord.</p><p>5. Remove meninges and place in 24-well plate with 1 ml PBS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dural Brain Meninges Whole Mount Preparation</strong></p><p>1.Remove muscles caudal of the skull and use fine angled scissors to make two incisions: (1) cut the skull starting at the brainstem and go counterclockwise toward the olfactory bulb. (2) Make a second incision in clockwise direction on the left side of the head until the rostral part is reached on both sides. Stay above the mandible muscles.</p><p>2. Use forceps to pick up the bone at the inferior end and bend it over, taking care not to damage the attached dura mater.</p><p>3. Place the skullcap in 24-well plate with 1 ml of 4% PFA and incubate at least 2&nbsp;h at room temperature or overnight at 4&nbsp;°C.</p><p>4. Wash once with 1 ml PBS. Carefully remove meninges (dura and some arachnoid) from interior part of the skull cap with fine forceps under a dissecting scope. It is easiest to start at the top of the skull and pull the meninges down in the middle part, and then remove the sides. Move along the edge and peal the meninges from each site and collect it by the pineal gland. If done correctly, the whole meninges can be scoped up in on piece (<em>Note: </em>Be careful to not tear the meninges and only touch the edges to collect the meninges in the center of the skullcap.).</p><p>5. Place dissected meninges in 1 ml of PBS in a 24-well plate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Immunohisto-chemistry and Imaging Meninges</strong></p><p>1. Wash tissue once in 0.5 ml PBS and incubate in 0.3 ml blocking solution for 1&nbsp;h at room temperature (<em>Note: </em>The volume used should be just enough to cover the entire tissue. In general, we recommend all steps to be performed on an orbital shaker (with slow agitation). The serum used for blocking depends on the species the secondary antibody was raised in. If the target antigen is intracellular, it is important to permeabilize with Triton X-100 to improve the penetration of antibodies.).</p><p>2. Immunostain the meninges with 0.3 ml primary antibody, such as VEGFR-3, Lyve-1 and podoplanin (at a concentration of 1:100, 1:400, and 1:100) in PBST overnight at 4&nbsp;°C (<em>Note: </em>Longer incubation periods do not enhance the staining signal significantly. We routinely use directly conjugated antibodies for multicolor staining if clones were generated in the same animal species and have corresponding secondary antibodies.).</p><p>3. Decant the solution and wash with 0.5 ml PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat two times with fresh PBS.</p><p>4. Incubate the tissue with 0.3 ml secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescent protein (at a concentration of 1–2&nbsp;μg/ml) in PBST with 1% BSA for 1&nbsp;h at room temperature in the dark.</p><p>5. Decant the secondary antibody solution and wash once with PBS and incubate in 0.3 ml Hoechst or DAPI (at a concentration of 0.1–1&nbsp;μg/ml in PBS) for 3 min at room temperature in the dark.</p><p>6. Rinse twice with 0.5 ml PBS.</p><p>7. Transfer meninges with paintbrushes to a glass slide with a few drops of PBS. Unfold them carefully and aspirate PBS to flatten meninges and let them dry. Cover with mounting medium to preserve fluorescence and seal with a nail polish to prevent movement (<em>Note: </em>Avoid any bubbles to not affect the preservation of the tissue and quality of the image.).</p><p>8. The tissue is now ready for imaging by using a conventional widefield microscope, confocal microscope, or an ultramicroscope (<em>Note: </em>Depending on the mounting medium, slides can be stored at 4&nbsp;°C or −20&nbsp;°C in the dark for weeks or month.).

The neck is shaved, the mouse placed on a stereotaxic frame and the head secured with tooth and ear bars.</p><p>3. The surgical site is swabbed with 10% iodine, followed by 70% ethanol, and a 1 cm sagittal incision of the skin over the occipital bone and cervical spinal cord is made.</p><p>4. Under the dissection microscope, the covering muscle layers are separated by blunt dissection with forceps and a pair of retractors used to hold the muscles apart.</p><p>5. The mouse’s body is lowered by ~1 cm so that the head forms a 140° angle (<em>Note: </em>It is important to position the head and body of the mouse properly on the stereotaxic instrument so that the cisterna magna is exposed.).</p><p>6. The posterior atlantooccipital membrane is exposed and penetrated with a Hamilton syringe equipped with a bevel ended 33-G needle (<em>Note: </em>Avoid blood vessels to prevent bleeding.).</p><p>7. A volume of 2&nbsp;μl of tracer, such as fluorescent ovalbumin, is diluted in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (<em>see</em>&nbsp;Note&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8712-2_9#Sec22" target="_blank">4&nbsp;</a>) and slowly infused intra cisternally.
