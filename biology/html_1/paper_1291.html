The optimized acid hydrolysis of serum/plasma samples takes only 10 min and 10 μl of acid and 2 μl serum/plasma samples. The monosaccharide composition analysis is subsequently accomplished by HPAEC-PAD analysis. Each step of the experimental procedures has been optimized with repeated tests of monosaccharide standards and serum samples. The described workflow takes approximately 70-90 min, up to 48 serum/plasma samples can be analyzed with one HPAEC-PAD instrument per day.</p><br>Keywords: serum, plasma, glycan, microwave instrument-assisted acid hydrolysis, high performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD), monosaccharide compositions<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p>	Four major types of human biomolecules include nucleic acids (including DNA and RNA), proteins, lipids and glycans. Unlike RNAs and proteins, glycan biosynthesis has no templates but depends on genes, nutrition, and other environmental factors in time and space[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1</a>]. As results, animal glycome is estimated to be 10<sup>4</sup> times larger than the proteome[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2-5</a>]. Glycans are abundantly present in blood circulations in patients suffering cancerous and non-cancerous diseases. Thus, glycans are rich source for biomarker discovery. However, nearly all studies of serum glycans as possible disease biomarkers have been focused on resolving complicated glycan structures by complicated glycan preparation procedures plus expensive instrumentations, such as LC-MS[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">5-7</a>]. </p><p>	Despite there are many different types of glycans [<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">8</a>], all human glycans consist of up to 10 monosaccharides, i.e. sialic acid (SA), N-acetyl galactosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetyl glucosamine (GalNAc), galactose (Gal), mannose (Man), fucose (Fuc), glucose (Glc), xylose (Xyl), glucuronic acid (GlcA), and iduronic acid (Ido A). However, few methods have been developed to quantify glycan contents or monosaccharide compositions in human sera or plasmas.</p><p>	This protocol was originally developed from the corresponding author’s laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis for glucosamine- and galactosamine-based, serum- or animal tissue-derived glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification purposes [<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">9-13</a>]. We then discovered that significantly different quantity and compositions of glucosamine and galactosamine are present in the plasmas of human patients suffering lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers, respectively, [<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10</a>, <a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">14</a>]. Since the major glycans in human sera/plasmas are N-linked and O-linked glycans instead of GAGs, we subsequently developed a HPLC method that can quantify all other monosaccharides in addition to glucosamine and galactosamine released from serum/plasma glycans simultaneously[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">15-18</a>] for biomarker development. &nbsp;</p><p>	Releasing monosaccharides from serum/plasma glycans is the bottleneck of monosaccharide composition analysis[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">19</a>, <a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">20</a>]. It is usually conducted in a sealed glass ampoule at 105–120 °C for 1–6 h[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">21</a>] or in a PicoTag station[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10</a>]. To enhance the efficiency of the acid hydrolysis, we previously developed a MAAH coupled HPAEC-PAD analysis for monosaccharide composition analysis of 7 different types of polysaccharides[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">22</a>]. In current study, we optimized the acid hydrolysis condition for releasing glycan monosaccharides from serum/plasma samples and the monosaccharide compositions are then obtained by HPAEC-PAD analysis.&nbsp;</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>Deionized water (Millipore Mingche Q-Gard system, 18.2 MΩ-cm (Millipore)) </p><p>Hydrochloric acid (HCl; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent)</p><p>Sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH; 50% w/w, Fisher Scientific)</p><p>Methanol (chromatographically pure, Millipore)</p><p>Glucose (Glc; 99% purity, Merck)</p><p>Mannose (Man; 99% purity, Merck)</p><p>Fucose (Fuc; 99% purity, Merck)</p><p>Galactose (Gal; 99% purity, Merck)</p><p>Glucosamine (GlN; 99% purity, Merck)</p><p>Galactosamine (GalN; 99% purity, Merck)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>REAGENT SETUP</strong></p><p><strong>Sera/plasmas</strong> Each serum/plasma sample is stored at -80 °C before use. </p><p><strong>Monosaccharides standard stock solution (10 mg/mL)</strong> Weigh the correct amount of monosaccharides standard, dissolve in Milli-Q water, aliquot into tubes and store at -20 °C.</p><p><strong>HCl (6 M) </strong>Prepare by careful dilution from concentrated HCl.

NaOH solution should be prepared fresh.</p><p>· Step 12 Problem 2: No signal, weak signal or impurity peaks; Solution: Check the concentration of HCl. Serum cannot be fully hydrolyzed if the concentration of HCl is lower than 6 M. Over hydrolyzing samples by using higher than 6 M HCl could result in weak signal or impurity peaks.</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>Steps 1-2, serum collection and storage: ~50 min for 60 samples</p><p>Steps 3-5, serum glycan acidolysis: ~ 10 min for 10 samples</p><p>Step 6, sample transfer: ~ 10 min for 10 samples<strong> </strong></p><p>Steps 7-8, acid removal: ~30 min for 10 samples</p><p>Step 9, monosaccharide standard preparation: ~5 min</p><p>Steps 10-11, HPAEC-PAD analysis: ~30 min per sample</p><p>Steps 12-13, our lab is equipped with a Thermo Scientific™ Dionex™ ICS-5000+&nbsp;system and has the capacity of analyzing 48 samples per day. </p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p><strong>Methodological investigation</strong></p><p>	We published a precise and convenient method for analyzing monosaccharide compositions of 7 different types of polysaccharides by MAAH plus HPAEC-PAD analyses previously[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">22</a>]. Our ultimate goal is to use the microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis for serum/plasma monosaccharide composition analysis.</p><p><strong>The effects of microwave power on monosaccharide standards</strong></p><p>	To test the effect of microwave power on monosaccharide standards, the established microwave conditions (100 W at 100°C for 10 min) without 3 mol/L HCl, are applied to 0.1 mg/ml mixed six monosaccharide standards. The t-test was performed on the A (no-microwave) and B (microwave) groups containing the 6 monosaccharide standards. We found that <strong>(Figure 1)</strong> there is no significant difference between the two group (<em>p &gt; 0.05</em>), indicating that the microwave-power itself has no effect on both physical and chemical properties of each of the monosaccharides in the mixture at the condition of 100 W at 100°C for 10 min.</p><p><strong>The effect of HCl concentrations on serum MAAH</strong></p><p>	Since the glycans in the serum/plasma samples are present as thousand different kinds of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are not pure polysaccahrides as those used in our previous publication [<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">15</a>], we tested the best HCl concentrations that should be used for microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis of serum/plasma samples.</p><p>	We first made a serum pool by combining 100 μL serum from each of 10 kidney cancer patients. Two μL serum x 6 from the serum pool are taken and 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mol/L HCl (final concentration) are used for acid hydrolysis under the condition of 100 W at 100 °C for 10 min, respectively. The resulting supernatant at each HCl concentration is analyzed by HPAEC-PAD. The ion chromatogram is shown in <strong>Figure 2a</strong>. The experiment is repeated three times. The average peak areas of each monosaccharide obtained from the serum pool is calculated. We found that 4 mol/L HCl produces the highest yield of two basic monosaccharides (GalN and GlcN) but with less neutral monosaccharides (Fuc, Gal, Glc, and Man). In contrast, 2 mol/L HCl only partially releases the two basic monosaccharides (GalN and GlcN). We concluded that 3 mol/L HCl keeps a balance in releasing both basic and neutral monosaccharides <strong>(Figure 2b).&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The best volume of serum/plasma samples required for monosaccharide composition analysis</strong></p><p>	In searching for the best volume of serum samples for monosaccharide composition analysis, we made another serum pool by combining 100 μL serum from each of 10 uremia patients. In triplicate, 2, 5 or 10 μL sera from the serum pool are used for acid hydrolysis under the condition of 3 mol/L HCl, 100 W at 100 °C for 10 min, respectively. The resulting supernatant is analyzed by HPAEC-PAD. The ion chromatogram of serum monosaccharides of the serum pool is shown in <strong>Figure 3a</strong>. Under the same acid hydrolysis conditions, we found that the content of monosaccharides is increased with increased amount of sera used but the increase is not linear. We decided to use 2 mL serum for MAAH coupled HPAEC-PAD analyses for two reasons: 1. two mL serum is sufficient for detecting all six monosaccharides; 2. For certain diabetic patients, the glucose peak becomes platooned by hitting the up-limit of PAD detection if 5 μL serum is used.</p><p><strong>Repeatability of the optimized MAAH coupled HPAEC-PAD analysis</strong></p><p>	We next determined the reproducibility of the optimized condition of 3 mol/L HCl, 100 W at 100°C for 10 min for monosaccharide composition analysis of 2 ml of serum sample from a kidney cancer patient. Mean value of each monosaccharide retention time (min), peak area (nC*min) and their RSD are showed, respectively. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Monosaccharide</strong>	<strong>retention time (min)</strong>	<strong>RSD (%)</strong>	<strong>Peak area (nC*min)</strong>	<strong>RSD (%)</strong></p><p>Fuc							4.87±0.004					0.08			0.23±0.01					4.35</p><p>GalN						8.45±0.004					0.05			0.70±0.04					5.71</p><p>GlcN						10.09±0.004				0.04			13.59±0.74					5.44</p><p>Gal							12.16±0.004				0.03			1.85±0.08					4.32</p><p>Glc							13.34±0.004				0.03			9.72±0.52					5.34</p><p>Man							14.81±0.005				0.03			2.26±0.12					5.31</p><p><br></p><p>	The data showed that the relative standard deviation (RSD) of retention time is less than 0.1 % and RSD of peak area is less than 6 %, demonstrating a good reproducibility of 6 consecutive analysis <strong>(Figure 4)</strong>. </p><p>	Thus, the optimized method has the characteristics of rapid acid hydrolysis (only 10 min is needed), efficient (10 samples are processed at a time), less acid consumption (only 10 μL 3 mol/L HCl is used for hydrolysis), straight forward (no monosaccharide derivation is needed for detection[<a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">25</a>, <a href="about:blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">26</a>]), and small sample size (only 2 ml of serum/plasma sample is used). In conclusion, an efficient, sensitive, and quick monosaccharide composition analysis of serum/plasma sample is established using MAAH coupled HPAEC-PAD analysis.</p><h2>References</h2><p>1.
