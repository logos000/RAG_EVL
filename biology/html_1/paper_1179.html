Using 18 clickable labels for click-ExM imaging of DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, glycans and small molecules, we demonstrate its universality, compatibility with signal-amplification techniques, and broad applications in cellular and tissue imaging. The click-labeling and ExM steps could be finished within two days.

As a critical step of ExM, the biomolecules or the labeled fluorophores need to be covalently anchored into the polymer network and preserved during homogenization of the fixed cells (e.g., by strong protease digestion) to ensure isotropic expansion. This imposes a great challenge to develop tailored protocols for specific imaging targets including proteins and RNA; however, other types of biomolecules such as lipids, glycans, and small molecules remain challenging for ExM.</p><p>	To expand the applicability of ExM, we developed click‑ExM, a variant of ExM, into which a unified method to label, anchor, and preserve fluorescent signals for all kinds of biomolecules is integrated.&nbsp;To develop such a unified protocol, we exploited click-labeling, which has emerged as a versatile tool for fluorescence imaging of various biomolecules. DNA, RNA, proteins, glycans, and lipids can all be metabolically labeled with a bioorthogonal or “clickable” functional group (e.g., azide or alkyne), which is subsequently conjugated with fluorescent probes via bioorthogonal chemistry such as Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC or click chemistry) and copper-free click chemistry.&nbsp;In click‑ExM, the metabolically labeled biomolecules are reacted with azide-biotin or alkyne-biotin via click chemistry, followed by staining with fluorescently labeled streptavidin.&nbsp;The streptavidin-fluorophore conjugates serve as a tri‑functional probe, which binds biotin, anchors into the gel, and presents fluorescence.</p><p><br></p><h2>Reagents</h2><p>All chemical reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers, and used without further purification.
