Pre-warm supplemented MEM growth medium (MEM + glutaMAX with 10% FBS, 1X penicillin/streptomycin, 1X NEAA, and 1X sodium pyruvate) and PBS in a 37°C water bath and a trypsin aliquot at room temperature (~30 minutes).</p><p>2.	Trypsinize, collect, and pellet IMR90 cells at 1,000 x g at room temperature.</p><p>a.	NOTE: Cells should be used on the third day after being plated at either 4.0 x 104 cells/mL.</p><p>3.	Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 12 mL of supplemented growth medium.&nbsp;Triturate at least four times to thoroughly break up the majority of clumped cells.&nbsp;Add additional growth medium to dilute the cell suspension if desired (typically, a total volume of 12 mL per 2-3 15 cm plates collected).</p><p>4.	Prepare a 1:1 dilution in Trypan Blue (50 μL Trypan blue + 50 μL cell suspension) in an Eppendorf tube.</p><p>5.	Count cells that exclude Trypan Blue on a hemocytometer (count both sides of two independent loads, four counts total).&nbsp;Record the number of cells obtained per plate.&nbsp;Calculate the number of population doublings that occurred during the last passage (include the indicated values in the associated worksheet):</p><p><br></p><p>([(3.32(log(cells collected per plate)-log(cells plated per plate)) + previous APD])</p><p><br></p><p>6.	Dilute cells to 1.0 x 105 cells/mL (for 6 well) or 1.25 x 105 cells/mL (for 12 well) in supplemented growth medium in a 50 mL tube or larger sterile bottle to the total volume that will be used for seeding (2 mL/well for 6 well and 800 μL/well for 12 well, making 2-5 mL extra).</p><p>7.	Mix thoroughly by inversion and dispense the diluted cell suspension into each collagen-coated well in the appropriate volume:</p><p>a.	2 mL/well for 6 well plates</p><p>b.	800 μL/well for 12 well plates</p><p>8.	Incubate in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and 20% O2 for 1 day before combining with 16HBE cells.</p><p><br></p><p>Seed 16HBE Cells in Transwell Inserts (Day 1)</p><p>1.
