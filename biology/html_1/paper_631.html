In addition to commercial tags such as TMT and iTRAQ, we developed 4-plex and 12-plex N,N-dimethyl leucine (DiLeu) tags as cost-effective alternatives with comparable performance <sup>1,2</sup>. DiLeu labeling methods allow multiplexing of samples and enable comparative analysis of acetyl-CoA flux regulated proteomes from different mouse models in the same LC-MS runs, providing statistically reliable data that avoids run-to-run variations. This protocol describes steps including 40 hrs of sample preparation of lysis, tryptic digestion, tag labeling, SCX purification and high pH fractionation, as well as details about LC-MS/MS analysis and data processing. The protocol can be applied to other proteome quantitation systems.</p><br>Keywords: Isobaric Labeling, Proteomics, Quantitation, Mass Spectrometry, LC-MS/MS<br><h2>Procedure</h2><p><strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Tissue Lysis and Protein Extraction</u></strong></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare 10 mL lysis buffer (8M urea, 50 mM Tris Base, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM NaCl, 1 EDTA-free Roche protease inhibitor tablet (11836170001), 1 Roche PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor tablet (04906845001)), adjust pH to ~8 by adding HCl;</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place tissue in 2 mL Eppendorf tube;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add 500 µL lysis buffer;</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vortex sample until it begins to break up, some tissue may require vigorous manual lysis;</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Place sample in 4 ºC ice water bath to keep cold) Use a probe sonicator to perform three 15 second sonication pulses at 50% amplitude (60W), each followed by a 30 second rest period;</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary, repeat sonication until tissue is lysed.

The parent mass error tolerance was set to be 50 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was 0.02 Da. Fixed modifications included DiLeu labels on peptide N-termini and lysine residues (+145.12801 Da) and carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues (+57.02146 Da). Dynamic modifications included oxidation of methionine residues (+15.99492 Da). Identifications were filtered at 1% peptide and protein false discovery rate (FDR). Quantitation was performed in Proteome Discoverer with a reporter ion integration tolerance of 20 ppm for the most confident centroid. Only the peptide spectrum matches (PSM)s that contained all reporter ion channels were considered, and protein quantitative ratios were determined using a minimum of one unique quantified peptide;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistical analysis: Reporter ion ratio values for protein groups were exported to Excel workbook and student t-test was performed with biological quadruplicates.
