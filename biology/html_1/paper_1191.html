It has led to significant changes in healthcare provision and clinical research activities associated with change in demand, practice and policy. In March 2020, the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network suspended any new or ongoing studies at NHS and social care sites that were not nationally prioritised COVID-19 studies. The rapid reconfiguration of services meant many dedicated research personnel moved to the healthcare frontline, and remaining research personnel refocused work on COVID-19. Similar changes occurred in healthcare, with non-urgent clinical activity suspended and new, remote ways of working introduced to protect both patients and healthcare personnel as the UK entered a lockdown in March 2020.</p><p><br></p><p>The importance of public involvement in all aspects of clinical and research activity is well recognised and enshrined in policy and procedures throughout health and social care; it’s relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic is reaffirmed by the NIHR (2). Public involvement improves the quality and relevance of research (3), and, though rapid escalation of research considering COVID-19 makes involvement more challenging, these benefits are worth retaining. Public involvement can help researchers understand public perception of risk as the driver of a range of pandemic-related behaviours (4), such as compliance with lockdown requirements, adoption of protective measures like mask wearing and social distancing, and wider engagement with services including health, screening, social care and education and therefore support communication efforts (5).</p><p><br></p><p>Understanding of public feelings of safety, perception of factors affecting feelings of safety, intention to participate in research, comfort with new ways of working, and attitudes to research will support efforts to ease lockdown in the sensitive hospital environment and is a key component of NIHR Restart project (6). Procedures, and particularly communication, around restarting clinical and research activities within hospitals need to incorporate the public voice to maximise chances of success. Failure to ensure patients and research participants feel safe within the hospital could have wide ranging impact, including failure to access necessary healthcare (highlighted by the 57% decrease in A&amp;E attendance in April 2020 (7)), postponement or failure to access necessary treatment (8), successfully delivering key metrics for research outside of COVID-19, and failure to recruit to research essential to tackling COVID-19. Furthermore, communication and perception of risk are poorly understood and have the potential to impact public trust in science (9).</p><p><br></p><p>We aim to rapidly assess public attitudes to attending hospital across the UK for research purposes and clinical appointments, and attitudes to vaccine research using an online survey and online focus groups.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>References</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHO. <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019</a> <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019</a>: WHO; 2020 [</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIHR. <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/nihr-reaffirms-its-support-for-patient-and-public-involvement-engagement-and-participation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/24641" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/nihr-reaffirms-its-support-for-patient-and-public-involvement-engagement-and-participation-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/24641</a> 2020 [</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NIHR. <a href="https://www.invo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/9938_INVOLVE_Briefing_Notes_WEB.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.invo.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/9938_INVOLVE_Briefing_Notes_WEB.pdf</a>. 2020.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detoc M, Gagneux-Brunon A, Lucht F, Botelho-Nevers E.

Social media posts will be shareable so people can ‘retweet’ and ‘share’ the link to reach a wider audience. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The link to the online survey will be emailed to the NIHR Leicester BRC public involvement mailing lists, and by cascade (snowball sampling) to colleagues in public involvement roles emailing the link on to their public involvement mailing lists.</p><p><br></p><p>Potential participants who click on the link with be presented with the survey participant information. The next 3 questions cover screening and consent using yes/no (Boolean) options. A negative answer will take the potential participant to an end-screen thanking them for their interest and explaining that they are not eligible to participate.</p><p><br></p><p>S1&nbsp;Are you aged 18 or over? Yes/no&nbsp;</p><p>S2&nbsp;Are you resident in the UK? Yes/no&nbsp;</p><p>S3&nbsp;Are you willing to take part in the research as described? Yes/no&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Method: An English-language online survey was developed in partnership with the NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre Bioinformatics Hub in Research Electronic Data Capture Software (REDcap). The survey was developed specifically for this research and featured 1) participant information, 2) screening against inclusion/exclusion criteria and 3) survey questions. The survey will be administered between 11 and 24 June, 2020.</p><p><br></p><p>Survey Content: Participant characteristics of age, sex and ethnicity will be collected, and whether they considered themselves classified at risk of COVID-19 because of a health condition (yes <em>vs.</em> no) or their age (yes <em>vs.</em> no). The questionnaire focuses on perception of risk when attending hospitals during the pandemic. A 100-point Likert scale ranging from disagree (0) to agree (100) for each statement created by the researchers will be presented with a simple, interactive sliding scale. The questions are shown in Appendix 1. </p><p><br></p><p>Analysis of Scales: Descriptive analyses will be performed. The continuous 100-point Likert scale will be assessed for normality using histograms and the Shapiro-Wilk test. The distribution of responses is not likely to be normally distributed, therefore the median value and interquartile range (IQR) will be used to present the findings. The responses will be stratified into four key groups: 1) whether or not the participant was classified at risk of COVID-19 because of a health condition; 2) or due to their age; 3) men or women; and 4) White European or Black, Asian or Minority Ethnicity (BAME). The two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test will be used to calculate whether there is a significant difference between groups, the statistical significance will be set at P-value&lt;0.05 (two-sided). Results will be reported as median Likert scale followed by the interquartile range (median [IQR]). Participants are not required to answer every statement. Data from REDCap will be exported into Stata version 16.0 to conduct data analyses. </p><p><br></p><p>Focus Groups</p><p><br></p><p>Recruitment: The email invitation (Appendix 2) will be emailed to the NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre public involvement mailing list (approximately 500 people). Potential participants will contact the researcher, who will post out the participant information sheet and postal consent form (Appendix 3) with a reply paid envelope. On return of the completed consent form the link for the focus group will be emailed to the participant.</p><p>Method: Focus groups will be hosted on the platform ‘zoom’ on the 30<sup>th</sup> June 2020, and recorded using the function in ‘zoom’. The topic guide is shown in Appendix 4. The researcher, Rebecca Pritchard will facilitate the focus group. </p><p>Analysis: Focus group recordings will be transcribed and identifying elements (comments, names etc) removed. Transcriptions will be subject to thematic analysis using NVivo 11. </p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>Ethics</p><p><br></p><p>This research will be reviewed by the Medicine and Biological Sciences Research Ethics Committee of the University of Leicester (ref:26258-rp237-ls:healthsciences).</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Appendix 1: Survey Participant Information and Questions</p><p>Consent and PIS Section&nbsp;</p><p>Study Title: Exploring risk perceptions of COVID-19 exposure in relation to hospital attendance&nbsp;</p><p>Researcher: Rebecca Pritchard&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is this project?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This questionnaire asks people about their general attitude to taking risks, what they think about risk and&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;or coronavirus&nbsp;and what they think about attending hospital for various reasons during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why are we doing this research project?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>We want to know how risky people think it is, coming to hospital accident and emergency, outpatients and research units. &nbsp;</p><p><em> </em>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do I have to take part?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>No, it is up to you if you want to take part.
