Robust culturing of these cells on collagen-fibroblast constructs produces three-dimensional models comparable to&nbsp;<em>in vivo </em>VF mucosa.</p><br>Keywords: vocal fold epithelium, in vitro culture, differentiation<br><h2>Introduction</h2><p><sup>﻿</sup>This protocol focuses on formation of reproducible hiPSC-derived VF epithelium that mimics development of VF epithelium <em>in utero</em> and creation of <em>in vitro</em> human VF mucosa composed of hiPSC-derived stratified squamous VF epithelial cells (VFEC) and collagen gel seeded with human primary VF fibroblasts (VFF). This model system can be used for VF mucosal disease modeling and testing therapeutic approaches for the treatment of vocal fold remodeling, inflammation or other laryngeal diseases.</p><h2>Reagents</h2><p><strong>Growth media:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;RPMI medium supplemented with Glutamax (Gibco, Life Technologies, cat#: 61870-036)</p><p>-&nbsp;DMEM/F-12 with Glutamax (Gibco, Life Technologies;cat#: 10565-018)</p><p>-&nbsp;DPBS without Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ (Lonza, Morristown, NJ; cat#: 17-512F)</p><p>-&nbsp;10xDMEM (10% final volume; Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO; 02429 -100ml)</p><p>- 10xPBS pH=7.4 Quality Biological;&nbsp;Gaithersburg, MD; cat#: 119-069-101)</p><p>-&nbsp;DMEM medium - high glucose (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO; cat#: D6429-500ml)</p><p>- Ham's F12 Nutrient Mix (Gibco Life technologies; cat#: 11765-054)</p><p>- Collagen Type 1, rat tail high concentration collagen (Corning; Corning, NJ; cat#: 354249)</p><p>- HyPure Cell Culture Grade Water (Hyclone; Pittsburgh, PA; cat#: SH3052903)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Enzymes: </strong></p><p>-&nbsp;Trypsin (TE) Tryple Express (Gibco life Technologies, cat#: 12604-013) for passaging VF basal epithelial  progenitors</p><p>- Trypsin, Hyclone trypsin 0.25% (Hyclone, Pittsburgh, PA; cat#: SH30042.02) for passaging VF fibroblasts</p><p>- Versene 1x (Gibco Life Technologies; cat#: 15040-866) for passaging of human iPS cells</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Supplements:</strong></p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Activin A (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA; cat#: 120-14)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Wnt3A (R&amp;D Systems, Mineapolis, MN; cat#: 5036-WN)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Y-27632 dihydrochloride (rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, R&amp;D Minneapolis, MN; cat#: 1254/10)</p><p>-&nbsp;Fetal bovine serum (FBS) Ppeak Serum, Wellington, CO; cat#: PSFB3)</p><p>-&nbsp;B27 supplement (Gibco, Life Technologies; cat#: 17504044).</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;N2 supplement (Gibco, Life Technologies; cat#: 17502048)</p><p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;l-Ascorbic acid (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO; cat#: A82902)</p><p>-&nbsp;1-Thioglycerol (MTG; Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO; cat#: M6165)</p><p>-&nbsp;Penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) (Gibco,Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; cat#: 15-140-122)</p><p>-&nbsp;NOGGIN (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; cat#: 8057-NG)</p><p>-&nbsp;SB-431542 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; cat#: 1614/10)</p><p>-&nbsp;FGF-2 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; cat#: 233-FB)</p><p>-&nbsp;FGF10 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; cat#: 345-FG)</p><p>-&nbsp;FGF7/ keratinocyte growth factor (KGF; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; cat#: 251-KG)</p><p>-&nbsp;cell culture inserts (Corning, Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO; cat#: 353090)</p><p>-&nbsp;MEM–non-essential amino acids solution 100x (Gibco Life Technologies; cat#: 11140-050)</p><p>-&nbsp;hydrocortisone (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO; cat#: H0888)</p><p>-&nbsp;cholera toxin (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO; cat# C9903)</p><p>-&nbsp;insulin (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO; cat#: 91077C)</p><p>- adenine (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO; cat#: A8626)</p><p>-&nbsp;epidermal growth factor (EGF; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; cat#: 236-EG)</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All signaling factors must be reconstituted as per a manufacturer's protocol and stored at -20<sup>0</sup>C and should not be left at 4<sup>0</sup>C for more than a week.

The cultivation at the A/Li interface can be extended up to three weeks.</p><p><strong>Day 32 (or Day 33)</strong></p><p>Set the wells aside for RNA extraction and IF staining or flow cytometry cell sorting.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>Protocol 2: Preparation of collagen – fibroblast constructs</u></strong></p><p>Prepare collagen-fibroblast constructs 1 or 2 days before VBP are re-plated on day 10). VF fibroblasts are routinely cultivated in culture medium composed of DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10%FBS, 1% MEM NEAA 100x and 1% P/S. The medium is changed every other day and cells are passaged with trypsin.</p><p><strong>Day 8 / 9 (If the cells are re-plated on day 10) </strong></p><p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On ice, combine high-concentration rat tail collagen (4mg/ml; 80% final volume) and 10xDMEM (10% final volume) and adjust pH with 1N NaOH to 7.2 - 7.4.</p><p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resupend VF primary fibroblasts 2T1 cells, passage P5 - P6, in ice-cold FBS (10% final volume; 500 000 cells/ml final volume) and add to a collagen mixture.</p><p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plate a mixture of collagen gel and VF fibroblasts on a cell culture insert, 2ml per a 6-well culture insert</p><p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it solidified for one hour in a tissue incubator at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37<sup>0</sup>C degrees.</p><p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one hour, gently detach collagen with a pauster pipette and flood constructs with DMEM basal medium (Section 1, step 7). Return constructs into an incubator and left them at least 24 hours to allow for gel contraction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Day 10</strong> <strong>- Re-plating VBP on collagen-fibroblast constructs on day 10</strong></p><p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1 or 2 days, mildly trypsinize VBP and plate them on collagen constructs at high density in 100ul DMEM basal medium supplemented with high concentration of FGF2 (250ng/ml), FGF10 (100ng/ml) and FGF7 (100ng/ml) as described in Section 1.</p><p><strong>Note: T</strong>o make 4mg/ml rat tail collagen follow the manufacture's instructions and calculations. Briefly, to make 10ml of gel, mix 1.25ml 10xPBS, 4.17ml of rat tail collagen and 6.12ml of sterile HyPure water. Keep cold and adjust pH with 1N NaOH to pH=7.2 - 7.4. The calculations vary according to the Lot# of the rat tail collagen. The protocol for the gel preparation has been previously described by others (4, 5, and 6).</p><p><strong><u>Protocol 3: FAD medium preparation. </u></strong></p><p>FAD medium is freshly prepared every week, as previously described (4, 5, and 6)</p><p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix DMEM medium high glucose and Ham's F12 in ratio 1:3, with 2.5 ml FBS, 0.4 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 8.4ng /ml cholera toxin, 5 mg/ml insuline, 24mg/ml adenine, 10ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1% penicillin-streptomycin.</p><p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In submerged cultures, apply 1ml of FAD on the transwells with collagen constructs and 2 ml of FAD into the basolateral chamber. FAD is changed every other day.</p><p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create the A/Li, FAD medium was placed in the basolateral chamber only and changed three times a week.</p><p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Conditional FAD medium</strong> was formed by cultivation of FAD with human primary VFF 21T cells for 24 hours in 37<sup>0</sup>C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-humidified atmosphere. After 24 hours the medium was collected, sterile-filtered and stored at -20<sup>0</sup> C. The ratio of 30:70 (30% for conditional and 70% for fresh FAD medium) was used in the experiment.</p><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p><strong>1) Problem 1: </strong>During re-plating VF basal progenitors on constructs (day 10, Protocol 1), cells do not attach to the collagen gel properly, cells escape from the gel and attach to the bottom of a traswell instead.</p><p><strong>Possible reason</strong> - using more media than recommended and a bigger tip (100ul and larger).</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>Resuspend the cell suspension in less than 100ul of media and use 20ul tip to plate the cells on the top of the constructs. Place one drop of cell suspension after another on the same spot, the whole drop has to stay on the construct, until cells attach to the gel. Be also very careful when transferring cells to the incubator.</p><p><strong>2) Problem: </strong>During VBP differentiation on the constructs (day 12 - 32, Protocol 1), cells do not cover the construct properly and are organized in clusters.</p><p><strong>Possible reason: </strong>VF fibroblasts do not support VBP growth enough. Fibroblasts demonstrating more shrinkage of the collagen gel before adding cells (day 8 or 9 in protocol Section 2) better support the growth. </p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Screen fibroblasts for optimal growth-support and contraction abilities, when planning initial experiments. </p><p><strong>3) Problem: </strong>Some non specific differentiation of cells appears on constructs.</p><p><strong>Possible reason: </strong>During VBP repeating (day 10, 11) cell colonies are small and do not grow enough. Single cells leave the colonies and migrate into the empty space and undergo non-epithelial differentiation.</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>Do not use these VBP colonies for re-plating, collect only those that are confluent and proliferate.</p><p><strong>4) Problem: </strong>During gel preparation (day 8, 9 Protocol 2), collagen prematurely precipitates when transferring on transwells.</p><p><strong>Possible reason: </strong>pipets and tubes with solutions for mixing collagen gel are not cold enough.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> all components must be kept on ice until the gel mixture is placed on inserts. Pipets should be chilled before use.</p><h2>Time Taken</h2><p>Step 1 - DE differentiation - 3 days</p><p>Step 2 - AFE differentiation - 4 days</p><p>Step 3 - VBP differentiation 2 days (2D cultures) + 2 days on constructs</p><p>Step 4 - VFEC differentiation - 10 days</p><h2>Anticipated Results</h2><p>After 32 days in culture hiPSC-derived VF mucosa is formed.
