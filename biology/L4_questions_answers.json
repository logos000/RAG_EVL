In contrast, we observed nearly planar hetNOE and R1 relaxation profiles for the SMN and NusG Tudor domains. Similarly, we also observed enhanced R2 relaxation rates predominantly for the loop residues of the RfaH Tudor domain in comparison to the SMN and NusG Tudor domain (Figure 5).

However, quantitative analysis of such spectra has been complicated by the non-linearity of the signal intensities preventing its broad usage (Linnet and Teilum, 2016; Stetz and Wand, 2016). Nevertheless, latest developments employing accordion spectroscopy (Bodenhausen and Ernst, 1982) with nonuniform sampling providing comparable data quality as conventional approaches offers a promising route under time-limited circumstances (Carlstrom et al., 2019).",

However, quantitative analysis of such spectra has been complicated by the non-linearity of the signal intensities preventing its broad usage (Linnet and Teilum, 2016; Stetz and Wand, 2016).

The presence of extended motions on the fast timescale (ps–ns) was evident by the fluctuating hetNOE values (Figure 3) as well as R1 rates (Figure 4) across the RfaH Tudor domain. In contrast, we observed nearly planar hetNOE and R1 relaxation profiles for the SMN and NusG Tudor domains. Similarly, we also observed enhanced R2 relaxation rates predominantly for the loop residues of the RfaH Tudor domain in comparison to the SMN and NusG Tudor domain (Figure 5).

However, quantitative analysis of such spectra has been complicated by the non-linearity of the signal intensities preventing its broad usage (Linnet and Teilum, 2016; Stetz and Wand, 2016). Nevertheless, latest developments employing accordion spectroscopy (Bodenhausen and Ernst, 1982) with nonuniform sampling providing comparable data quality as conventional approaches offers a promising route under time-limited circumstances (Carlstrom et al., 2019).",
