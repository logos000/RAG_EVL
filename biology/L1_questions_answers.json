The protocol first requires a screening of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome using immunogenicity predictors to generate comprehensive epitope maps. Then, these epitope maps are used as input to Monte Carlo simulations designed to identify statistically significant “epitope hotspot” regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic. The epitope hotspots that share significant homology with proteins in the human proteome are removed to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. Finally, a database of the actual HLA genotypes of citizens is used to develop a “digital twin” type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population. The approach identifies an optimal constellation of epitope hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the human population.",

        "source": ". This is why the analysis of proteins that are actively synthesized by a microbe is now extensively recognized, as last step of the functional hierarchy, to provide associations with functions that become part of the active metabolism. Many protocols have been devised for extracting and analyzing proteins from diverse samples. However, case by case adaptations of those protocols are needed, in order to guarantee a correct representation of cytosolic and membrane bound proteins, the last one having common and inherent problems of extractions. Here we developed a two-step extraction method that can be universally used. It is based on the utilization of a first “soft” lysis buffer containing 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate hydrate (CHAPS) to extract mostly cytosolic proteins. membrane-bound proteins. Second, to improve the extraction efficiency of membrane proteins, we additionally used a new extraction method in which a multi-chaotropic lysis buffer containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 100 mM triethylamonium bicarbonate, a protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, and most importantly 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), was used. The addition of 5% SDS guarantee the extraction of membrane-bound proteins. Indeed, denaturing detergents such as SDS totally disrupt membranes, bind to both membrane (hydrophobic) and non-membrane (water-soluble, hydrophilic) proteins and denature proteins by breaking protein–protein interactions. Non-denaturing detergents such as CHAPS used in the first step have rigid and bulky nonpolar heads that do not penetrate into water-soluble proteins; consequently, they generally do not disrupt membranes or do at low extend",

We compared a detergent based buffer (SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate) and a chaotropic agent containing buffer (GH, guanidine hydrochloride) for protein extraction. Detergents lyse cells by forming micelles and disrupting membranes, thus releasing contents within cellular organelles. Chaotropic agents, such as guanidine hydrochloride, tend to lyse cells by disrupting hydrogen bonding of water molecules and ionic interactions. We also compared different purification methods, by S-Trap (Protifi), FASP and by in-solution digestion. Presence of detergents used in the extraction process and of polymers will greatly reduce the sensitivity and accuracy of mass spectrometry proteomics. Here, the comparison of two different spin column-based methods of purification against an in-solution digestion method will allow determination the effect of sample purification on mass spectrometry protein identification. In addition, strong cation exchange (SCX) pre-fractionation of peptides before LC-MS proteomics further enhances the number of identified proteins in both the SDS-FASP and SDS-STrap methods.",

In DNA-PAINT, the single-molecule events are due to transient binding and unbinding between a pair of DNA oligos, one attached to the affinity agent bound to a specific target and designated the docking strand (DS), and the other conjugated to a fluorophore and designated the imaging strand (IS). The fluorescent IS typically diffuses in the imaging buffer and is not visible until it hybridizes with the DS, upon which a distinct, fluorescent spot is detected on the camera. As such, each fluorescent spot arises from a single IS molecule binding to the DS, and the precise location of the DS (and the underlying target molecule) can be determined through subpixel localization of the single-molecule image.

This protocol introduces how to generate heart organoids from mouse embryonic stem cell-derived embryoid bodies (EB) in the presence of the laminin-entactin (LN/ET) complex and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) by three consecutive steps, 1) the culture of ESCs, 2) \nin vitro \ndifferentiation of ESCs into EBs and 3) \nin vitro \nculture of EBs for the generation of heart organoids. The generated heart organoids possess structural and functional capacity similar to atrial and ventricular parts of \nin vivo \nembryonic heart.

These hiHepPCs can continuously produce their cell population in long-term monolayer cultures and differentiate into both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes after cell aggregate and cystic epithelial spheroid formation, respectively, under three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions.\nReagents\nCell\nPlat-GP (Cell Biolabs) Cat#RV-103\nHUVEC (Takara) Cat#C-12200\nReagent\nInsulin (Wako) Cat#097-06474\nDexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) Cat#D8893\nNicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich) Cat#N0636\nL-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque) Cat#16948-04\nb-mercaptoethanol (Nacalai Tesque) Cat#21438-82",

Majority of outer membrane proteins have a β-barrel architecture (De Geyter et al., 2016; Plummer and Fleming, 2016; Noinaj et al., 2017; Slusky, 2017) and they often serve as selective channels for small molecules to move across in or out of the outer membrane. Surface exposed domains in these channels provide means to fluorescently label and utilise them for fluorescent microscopy studies to investigate their spatial organization, which in turn provide insights to understand the surface distribution of membrane proteins in bacteria (Gibbs et al., 2004; Spector et al., 2010; Rassam et al., 2015).",

But nutrient utilization from feeds implies the activity of different digestive processes, in which rumen microorganisms play a central role in. When ruminant consumes forage or concentrates, the carbohydrate and protein molecules enter the rumen and these are initially catabolized by the action of enzymes secreted by rumen bacteria, fungus, and protozoa. The final products of this catabolic process are the volatile fatty acids (VFA) or short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). \n \nThe VFA are short carbon chain compounds that are produced during the fermentative degradation of feeds in the rumen. These are absorbed by the rumen wall and converted by anabolic processes into carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids being these largely deposited in milk and meat.",

        "source": "Liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a dreadful vascular complication, which leads to liver damage. Part of its molecular mechanisms is still unclear (1). This is the reason why the experimental model is currently still challenging and essential. The reduction or total interruption of oxygenation (ischemic phase) is the starting event, which induces the accumulation of different molecular factors. The restoration of blood perfusion, instead of improving graft functionality, increases oxidative stress and parenchymal disruption due to the oxygen delivery and the neutrophils’ invasion respectively (2). IRI can be caused by different events such as inflow clumping during surgical procedures in hepatic resection, liver transplantation, trauma, as well as during the stenosis induced by tumours. IRI is often associated with graft loss in liver transplantation and with a higher morbidity and mortality (3). The surgical approach for the creation of an IRI experimental model can be ideally classified as follows: i) whole organ ischemia (total vascular inflow occlusion): in this section, it is possible to have different models such as total vascular occlusion (TVO), total vascular inflow occlusion (TVIO) (Figure 1), portal vein occlusion (PVO), hepatic artery occlusion (HAO), and a congestion model in which the inferior vena cava (IVC) is occluded (IVCO), ii) partial vascular inflow occlusion in which PVO, HAO, TVIO are applied onto one of the hepatic pedicle’s branches. Additionally, the bile duct can either be included or not in the occlusion or it can be a model itself known as bile duct occlusion (BDO). In 2012, Hori et al. reviewed the surgical approach to an orthotopic pig liver transplantation, the description of which can be also helpful for hepatic ischemic models (4).

        "source": "Optogenetic actuators exist in either active or inactive states. Absorption of light drives transition of the chromophore to the activated state, whereas thermal processes typically cause gradual relaxation to the initial or dark state. Relaxation rates determine how often activation light needs to be applied to maintain the activated state, but this rate is strongly affected by temperature and sequences surrounding the photosensor domain. Application of existing cellular optogenetic actuators and optimization of new ones therefore requires knowledge of the relaxation rates under the experimental conditions in which they are used. When proteins targeted by the actuator do not generate immediately visible responses, alternative methods are required to determine relaxation times. We describe a simple yet sensitive procedure to measure the relaxation rate constant for an optogenetic actuator. By using resonance energy transfer with a fused fluorescent protein tag to detect the change in chromophore state, low amounts of whole cell lysate are sufficient to perform the measurement.",

One of the difficulties is that, once activated, optogenetic actuators typically relax over a period of seconds and minutes via thermal processes\n2,3,4\n. When downstream effects are not visually detectable in real time, prior knowledge of relaxation times becomes important to design illumination protocols that keep actuators in active state for periods of time desired while avoiding excessive and potentially toxic illumination of the cells expressing the actuator.

As the state of this chromophore is responsible for actuation by LOV2-based optogenetic tools, the measurement provides a generic method to directly and sensitively inform the actuation state of the construct, regardless of its downstream mechanism of action. The relaxation rates of LOV2-based optogenetic actuators are thereby easily determined. We anticipate this method could be applicable to different photosensor domains and fluorescent proteins as long as the distance between the dipoles permit RET.

These molecules are produced in a range of organs and tissues at concentrations that are commensurate with their biological actions, which in large part are dictated by the affinity of these molecules to their cognate receptors. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) represents a robust and highly sensitive approach for both the identification and quantitation of these potent autacoids since chromatography allows for the separation of isobaric molecules as well as double bond and chiral isomers. Mass spectrometry captures information on the fragmentation profile of the molecules of interest, which coupled with the retention time of the molecule in liquid chromatography provides a fingerprint for the identification of these molecules. In addition, LC-MS/MS allows for the simultaneous monitoring of tens and sometimes hundreds of molecules providing a snapshot of a number of dynamic pathways and the flux down each of these bioactive pathways. Herein, we shall review the protocols employed to obtain a snapshot of the dynamic pathways for the four major bioactive metabolomes that include the arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, n-3 docosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid metabolomes",

Methodological capabilities, however, have been limited to few laboratories due to difficulties reproducibly visualizing these rare cell subsets in the meninges. To explore meningeal lymphatics fundamental role during homeostasis and how they may contribute to human pathology, the field has begun to require purification and characterization of lymphatic endothelial cells. Here, modern cell biological techniques involving a combination of histological, flow-cytometric, and functional drainage assays are applied to brain and spinal cord meninges and detailed stepwise procedures used for successful in vivo and ex vivo characterization of meningeal lymphatic vessels.",

Despite literature findings suggest that the most common instrumental method for determining SCFAs is the gas chromatography technique, the liquid chromatography technique using both C18 column and ion-exchange columns can be proposed as analytical technique for SCFAs determination as well. The use of the C18 column in HPLC-DAD has a particular limitation because it does not allow efficient separation of butyric and iso-butyric acids.

This condition may impair ruminant health, production, and reproduction. Thus, the use of forage conservation techniques is a common strategy in livestock systems to overcome this limitation.\nOne of the most common forage preservation techniques uses a combination of both anaerobic and acidic environments.

Here the sequence diversity in randomized gene libraries is typically low: protein variants with a few or even a single point mutation can be functionally different. An erroneous raw third-generation sequencing read cannot reliably be assigned to its template, when multiple template candidates differing only in few point mutations are possible. This inability to assign reads to any one parental molecule therefore renders consensus-based ‘polishing’ from unlinked reads impossible. Similar samples in which individual members differ merely in a few nucleotides can also be found in e.g. immune repertoires, metagenomic 16S amplicons or medical diagnostics, calling for a suitably high-quality sequencing solution.",
