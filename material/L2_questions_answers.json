In contrast to suspended load, bedload\nis deﬁned as the part of the sediment load occuring close to the granular bed in which\nparticles are in permanent or intermittent contact with the bed (Fredsøe & Deigaard\n1992).\n\nThe sediment transport rate is usually quantiﬁed in dimensionless form using the\ns = Qs/[d(cid:112)(ρp/ρf − 1)gd], where Qs\nso-called Einstein number (Einstein 1942), Q∗\nrepresents the volumetric sediment transport rate per unit width, ρp and ρf are the",
