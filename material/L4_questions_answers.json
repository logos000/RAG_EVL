            "The second theory (or group of theories) to take into account surface effects is based on the effect \nthat surface stress has in the mechanical response of the structures and, at least partially, is very similar \nto the already analyzed residual stress theory (RST), only that this time we consider surface stress. Gurtin \nand  Murdoch   [85]  developed  a  surface  elasticity  formulation,  in  which  a  surface  stress  tensor  is \nintroduced to augment the bulk stress tensor that is typically utilized in continuum mechanics. Similarly, \nresearchers have also considered the thermodynamics and energy of surfaces to study the surface effect \non mechanical behavior of materials  [86, 87, 88, 89]. For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses. Overall, these theories have been applied to different structures like plates, \nwires and rods  [54, 57, 92, 93, 94].",

            "In this paper, we describe an MPI/OpenMP based parallel algorithm in detail for MD of \nsystems with short range interactions and discuss its various implementation and speedup \nissues; the numerical aspects are demonstrated through a simulation of nano-indentation of \na chromium film by a spherical carbon indenter. Chromium and its compounds are used as \nprotective films owing to its corrosion resistance [31] and the dimensions of such films can \nreach the order of nanometers [32]. The embedded atom method [33] is used to model the \ninteractions among chromium atoms; the interactions between the indenter and the film are \nmodeled by a carbon-chromium Morse-potential [34]. The MD algorithm uses a two-tier \nVerlet neighbor list [35] to speed up the simulation. The parallelization scheme is \nimplemented on a shared address space computer architecture using multiple threads. Since \nour usage of threads is limited to within one SMP node only, MPI is used to perform the \nsimulation on a cluster of several SMP nodes in a parallel manner. Thus, MPI is used to \ncommunicate between the nodes and threads are used within each nodeto perform the \ncomputation. The speed-up and communication overhead obtained by varying the number \nof SMP nodes and threads used in each system are studied. Speed-up achieved by our \nalgorithm is also compared with that by LAMMPS.",

We present a hybrid algorithm \nusing MPI (Message Passing Interface) with OpenMP threads for parallelizing a \ngeneralized MD computation scheme for systems with short range interatomic interactions.  \nThe algorithm is discussed in the context of nano-indentation of Chromium films with  \ncarbon indenters using the Embedded Atom Method potential for Cr-Cr interaction and the \nMorse potential for Cr-C interactions. We study the performance of our algorithm for a \nrange of MPI–thread combinations and find the performance to depend strongly on the \ncomputational task and load sharing in the multi-core processor. The algorithm scaled \npoorly with MPI and our hybrid schemes were observed to outperform the pure message \npassing scheme, despite utilizing the same number of processors or cores in the cluster. \nSpeed-up achieved by our algorithm compared favourably with that achieved by standard \nMD packages.",

            "Our work is closely related to contemporary work by the second author and Hoai-Minh\nNguyen [24] concerning the wrinkling seen in a conﬁned ﬂoating sheet [18]. That problem has\nmany similarities to the one considered here: the sheet is in tension, the wrinkling is induced by\nlateral conﬁnement, and the length scale of the wrinkling is smallest at the unconﬁned edges of\nthe sheet. There is an underlying energy, considered already in [18]. The analysis in [24] adopts\na variational viewpoint similar to that of the present paper, proving matching (with respect\nto scaling) upper and lower bounds on the minimum energy. The construction leading to the\nupper bound uses self-similar coarsening, and is similar to the “type I deformation” discussed\nin Section 6.1. The proof of the lower bound shows that changing the length scale costs energy,\nusing an argument closely related to this paper’s Lemma 7.8. There is, however, a key diﬀerence\nbetween the hanging drape considered here and the conﬁned ﬂoating sheet considered in [24],\nnamely: the hanging drape can relieve its conﬁnement by lateral spreading, whereas in the\nﬂoating sheet this is prohibited by the boundary condition. This extra freedom means that\nwe must consider spreading as well as coarsening in connection with the upper bound, and it\nmeans that many new arguments are needed for the lower bound. (The analysis of the ﬂoating\nsheet also has complications not present here; in particular, the scale of the wrinkling at the\nunconﬁned boundary is determined by energy minimization rather than being imposed as a\nboundary condition.)",
            "As demonstrated in Fig. 6, the workpiece with the heaviest deformation showed surface\ndefects in the form of cracking on the outer diameter in the worked regions. Cracking did\nnot manifest on the low deformation sample. Cracks appeared on the surface of the sample\nearly in the forming pass and alternated from opening counter to the forming direction (A,\nC) to predominately opening with the forming direction (B, D–U). The cracks do not extend\nany further than 140 µm into the bulk of the material, as measured normal to the forming\ndirection. With the exception of one crack (C) extending up to 320 µm in length along the\naxis of the workpiece, the cracks tended to be short in axial length (not exceeding 200 µm).",
            "Within the continuum dislocation theory the asymptotic analysis of the plane\nstrain crack problem for a single crystal having only one active slip system\non each half-plane is provided. The results of this asymptotic analysis show\nthat the square root stress singularity remains valid during the plastic defor-\nmation, while the dislocation density is proportional to the stress intensity\nfactor and distributed as the square root of the distance from the crack tip.\nThe analytical solution for the angular distribution of the dislocation density\nis found."

Note that although the frictional work contains a\nsingular kernel, the work integral exists. We justify lin-\near material behavior assuming relatively small strains\nin the substrate. Next, taking derivative of Eq.4 with\nrespect to the current curvature yields the moment cur-\nvature relationship which can be evaluated numerically\n(See SM for derivation). We plot this relationship in a\nnon-dimensional form for a system with scale geometry\ndescribed in the introduction of the letter with various\nfriction coeﬃcients in the post-engagement regime to iso-\nlate frictional contribution, Fig. 3. This ﬁgure clearly\nshows that friction can perceptibly increase the bending\nstiﬀness of the structure and since it also controls the\nlocking envelope, the increase can be made to occur at\nmuch lower curvatures. Thus friction has a dual contri-\nbution to the moment-curvature relationship modulating\nboth the magnitude and shape of the response."

Similarly, \nresearchers have also considered the thermodynamics and energy of surfaces to study the surface effect \non mechanical behavior of materials  [86, 87, 88, 89]. For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses.

            "The second theory (or group of theories) to take into account surface effects is based on the effect \nthat surface stress has in the mechanical response of the structures and, at least partially, is very similar \nto the already analyzed residual stress theory (RST), only that this time we consider surface stress. Gurtin \nand  Murdoch   [85]  developed  a  surface  elasticity  formulation,  in  which  a  surface  stress  tensor  is \nintroduced to augment the bulk stress tensor that is typically utilized in continuum mechanics. Similarly, \nresearchers have also considered the thermodynamics and energy of surfaces to study the surface effect \non mechanical behavior of materials  [86, 87, 88, 89]. For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses. Overall, these theories have been applied to different structures like plates, \nwires and rods  [54, 57, 92, 93, 94].",

Gurtin \nand  Murdoch   [85]  developed  a  surface  elasticity  formulation,  in  which  a  surface  stress  tensor  is \nintroduced to augment the bulk stress tensor that is typically utilized in continuum mechanics. Similarly, \nresearchers have also considered the thermodynamics and energy of surfaces to study the surface effect \non mechanical behavior of materials  [86, 87, 88, 89]. For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses. Overall, these theories have been applied to different structures like plates, \nwires and rods  [54, 57, 92, 93, 94].",

Gurtin \nand  Murdoch   [85]  developed  a  surface  elasticity  formulation,  in  which  a  surface  stress  tensor  is \nintroduced to augment the bulk stress tensor that is typically utilized in continuum mechanics. Similarly, \nresearchers have also considered the thermodynamics and energy of surfaces to study the surface effect \non mechanical behavior of materials  [86, 87, 88, 89]. For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses. Overall, these theories have been applied to different structures like plates, \nwires and rods  [54, 57, 92, 93, 94].",

Aside from proving that it is pos-\nsible to construct a developable band from a rectangular\nstrip of width suﬃciently small relative to its length, Sad-\nowsky established an upper bound for bending energy of",

Wunderlich 20,21\nlater sharpened Sadowsky’s bound and generalized Sad-\nowsky’s bending energy to incorporate the eﬀect of ﬁnite\nwidth. The problem of constructing developable equilib-\nrium conﬁgurations was ﬁrst considered by Mahadevan\nand Keller, 10 whose numerically determined solutions led\nto a tighter upper bound on the bending energy but are\ninconsistent with results of Randrup and Røgen, 23 who\nshowed that the centerline of a Möbius band must have\nan odd number of switching points at which its curva-\nture and torsion both vanish. Using Wunderlich’s energy,\nStarostin and van der Heijden 11,12 computed equilibria\nthat meet these requirements and also found evidence to\nsuggest that Sadowsky’s energy is a singular limit that\nproduces centerlines with discontinuous curvatures.",

            "The second theory (or group of theories) to take into account surface effects is based on the effect \nthat surface stress has in the mechanical response of the structures and, at least partially, is very similar \nto the already analyzed residual stress theory (RST), only that this time we consider surface stress. Gurtin \nand  Murdoch   [85]  developed  a  surface  elasticity  formulation,  in  which  a  surface  stress  tensor  is \nintroduced to augment the bulk stress tensor that is typically utilized in continuum mechanics. Similarly, \nresearchers have also considered the thermodynamics and energy of surfaces to study the surface effect \non mechanical behavior of materials  [86, 87, 88, 89]. For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses. Overall, these theories have been applied to different structures like plates, \nwires and rods  [54, 57, 92, 93, 94].",

One obtains the same governing equations,\nconstitutive prescriptions and jump conditions across internal interfaces as in Toupin (1964)\nwith a strain energy density function of the form W (E, GradE), but no higher-order stress in\nthe theory, and a global statement of the second law.

For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses.

            "The second theory (or group of theories) to take into account surface effects is based on the effect \nthat surface stress has in the mechanical response of the structures and, at least partially, is very similar \nto the already analyzed residual stress theory (RST), only that this time we consider surface stress. Gurtin \nand  Murdoch   [85]  developed  a  surface  elasticity  formulation,  in  which  a  surface  stress  tensor  is \nintroduced to augment the bulk stress tensor that is typically utilized in continuum mechanics. Similarly, \nresearchers have also considered the thermodynamics and energy of surfaces to study the surface effect \non mechanical behavior of materials  [86, 87, 88, 89]. For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses. Overall, these theories have been applied to different structures like plates, \nwires and rods  [54, 57, 92, 93, 94].",

Simultaneous bending and stretching of a surface will, however, generally alter\nits Gaussian curvature. To model stretchable bands, it is therefore natural to incorporate energetic dependence on\nGaussian curvature.

            "The second theory (or group of theories) to take into account surface effects is based on the effect \nthat surface stress has in the mechanical response of the structures and, at least partially, is very similar \nto the already analyzed residual stress theory (RST), only that this time we consider surface stress. Gurtin \nand  Murdoch   [85]  developed  a  surface  elasticity  formulation,  in  which  a  surface  stress  tensor  is \nintroduced to augment the bulk stress tensor that is typically utilized in continuum mechanics. Similarly, \nresearchers have also considered the thermodynamics and energy of surfaces to study the surface effect \non mechanical behavior of materials  [86, 87, 88, 89]. For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses. Overall, these theories have been applied to different structures like plates, \nwires and rods  [54, 57, 92, 93, 94].",

            "The second theory (or group of theories) to take into account surface effects is based on the effect \nthat surface stress has in the mechanical response of the structures and, at least partially, is very similar \nto the already analyzed residual stress theory (RST), only that this time we consider surface stress. Gurtin \nand  Murdoch   [85]  developed  a  surface  elasticity  formulation,  in  which  a  surface  stress  tensor  is \nintroduced to augment the bulk stress tensor that is typically utilized in continuum mechanics. Similarly, \nresearchers have also considered the thermodynamics and energy of surfaces to study the surface effect \non mechanical behavior of materials  [86, 87, 88, 89]. For example, some of them  [58, 84, 90] related \nsurface tension to surface free energy via a strain dependent component. The difference in energies can \nbe used to estimate the effect of surfaces on mechanical properties. Shankar et al.  [91] proposed that \nnonlinear stress effects become significant at small scales leading to cross terms between the applied \nstress and surface stresses. Overall, these theories have been applied to different structures like plates, \nwires and rods  [54, 57, 92, 93, 94].",
