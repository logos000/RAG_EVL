Promising mechanisms of magnetization manipulation include the tuning of magnetic properties using an\nelectric ﬁeld [1–3], as well as the spin transfer torque (STT) switching arising from several mechanisms such as the\ndirect momentum transfer [4–6], the spin-orbit interaction [7, 8] or the spin-Seebeck eﬀect [9–11]. Nevertheless, an\nintriguing new possibility to switch the magnetization consists of using ultrashort laser pulses without any other stim-\nuli. Indeed, recent experiments have shown the possibility to perform magnetization reversal of ferrimagnetic GdFeCo\nalloy ﬁlms on a picosecond (ps) timescale using only femtosecond laser pulses [12, 13]. Thus, this all-optical switching\nis of great interest and has the potential to be implemented in spintronic devices like STT based memories [14, 15]\nor heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) [16, 17].

Experiments showed that the\neﬀect is nontrivially connected to the saturation [18]\nand sublattice magnetization [19] of the magnetically\nordered material and that the eﬀective temperature\nof the magnons, which are deemed responsible for the\neﬀect, is very close to that of the phonons [20].
